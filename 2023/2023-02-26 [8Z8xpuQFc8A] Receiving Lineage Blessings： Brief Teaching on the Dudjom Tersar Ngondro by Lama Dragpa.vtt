00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.840
 Tashile, warm greetings. Warm greetings. Thank you. Thanks for joining, friends. As always,

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:22.000
 it's such a special opportunity to be together, study, contemplate, and practice the holy Dharma.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.680
 So we'll reconnect to our motivation and shine on these three essential points of our practice

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.800
 right at the beginning and try to keep them going through the middle and then resolve again

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:40.000
 into the end to shine on this renunciation, Bodhichitta and pure perception. So renunciation,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.520
 this joy and just very kind of like sincere, kind of luscious, kind of sizzling, kind of

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.640
 closeness feeling for all the special things we have going in our favor now to connect

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.480
 with the Dharma and this body and this world system, these precious teachings taught by

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.000
 these precious teachers amongst this precious community. So really kind of like let that

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.220
 sizzle on and just kind of temporarily at least put aside the things that we're not so happy

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.880
 with or that are a little more kind of not so comfortable for us. Just kind of we have

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.880
 a short little window together and we'll just kind of set those things aside for this brief

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.280
 little window at least, kind of be more in the gratitude, a mode of joy, kind of a deep

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.440
 kind of contentment, this nourishing quality of being in a space of Dharma. And then secondly,

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.560
 this living experience of Bodhichitta, the heart mind of awakening or of enlightenment

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.200
 to really let ourselves kind of connect with that essential goodness we have and the goodness

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:41.320
 and others and all beings, all of us wanting to be happy and wanting to not be suffering,

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:47.560
 not go through all this dissatisfaction. We all have this tenderness that we really do

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:55.000
 want to have an ongoing kind of sense of peace and well-being and yet it's a fragile situation

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.880
 that doesn't last so long. So I have this tenderness of heart and also this bravery

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:06.600
 of heart that may I really be a healing balm in all circumstances for all beings I'm in

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:15.320
 touch with. May I be the exact perfect medicine to heal all wounds, to celebrate all lovely

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.600
 kind of amazing goodness expressions we have too. So this Bodhichitta, I really turn this

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:28.160
 on that may all beings have liberation, freedom and may I take that responsibility to bring

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:36.800
 that forth. And then thirdly, pure perception, not getting so hooked by our kind of how convinced

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.360
 we are that something's bad, something's wrong, that something's broken or stuck or needs

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.400
 to be removed or is stained, it's covered, kind of temporarily at least setting that

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.040
 kind of way of vision, like putting that down, relaxing that a little bit, and instead connecting

00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:00.160
 to that openness quality of our mind and of our heart. Kind of fresh, glowing, really

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:06.280
 connected sense of kind of this tenderness that really also kind of has this inherent

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:14.760
 dignity and this bright kind of brilliant prajna quality. My connect to that inner goodness

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.920
 is vajra pride or pure perception. So we bring kind of lighten all these three all at once

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:48.600
 and then in one sense just say we're being natural, kind of reconnect to our own nature.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:04:00.680
 So the topic for this brief time together today is specifically we're going to kind

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:07.120
 of circle around and explore the theme of receiving lineage blessings. What does it

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:15.440
 mean to receive lineage blessings? So this is such a deep, profound, very crucial, important

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:23.800
 topic for all practitioners, for Buddhists, for Mahayana Buddhists, for Vajrayana Buddhists.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:30.540
 This is like such a critically important, special, really important aspect of our study

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:40.000
 and our practice, receiving lineage blessings. And so I'm kind of in one way, a little, I'm

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:50.480
 kind of always there's a question for me of having it be a living experience, the dharma.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:05:00.360
 So I kind of, this is such a deep, really important topic, blessings, receiving blessings,

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.440
 connecting to lineage blessings. And there's a lot of ways to go about kind of exploring

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:10.360
 this or opening this. And that freshness of the inquiry is that it has to be alive and

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:18.920
 living. And at the kind of truth of my situation, my capabilities is I'm very limited. So I'm

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:24.240
 kind of in one way, I want to be spontaneous. In another way, it's like jumping off a clip

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:31.680
 and hoping I can fly. So I'm going to rely on the words of the Buddha here. And we're

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:38.960
 really following the footsteps of the Buddha and of Guru Rinpoche and these lineage masters.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:52.100
 Receiving lineage blessings. What is lineage? This is one I'm in my kind of reflection for

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:59.000
 some time. This is one of the aspects of Buddhism and Vajrayana Buddhism in particular, that's

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 an outstanding, brilliant quality. That we have an uninterrupted, stainless living lineage.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.920
 It goes all the way back from now all the way into the past to the Buddha Shakyamuni,

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:26.840
 and it's uninterrupted. This is really such an extraordinary quality of Buddhism in the

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:48.800
 world today. And yet, receiving lineage blessings always comes down to my mind, to my heart.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:55.680
 And technically speaking with Buddhists and refer oftentimes to this as the view. What

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:04.640
 is the view I'm holding, tawa? In one way, you can think of that as like how available

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:16.120
 am I to really be in touch with reality? With the truth? How like really, how ready am I

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:25.520
 to really honestly, vulnerably let my real experience right now be fully informed with

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:34.880
 the truth of reality? There's a common Tibetan saying about like the amount of blessings

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:44.760
 you receive depends on how you see your teacher. That comes down to the view. In view, we can

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:50.560
 think of it in one way as like a philosophical thing. Like we can try to designate it as

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:59.560
 an actual position or some kind of worldview, a way of poisoning the mind. But in a more

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:04.160
 kind of simple everyday way, view is just every single moment we show up with some kind

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:12.000
 of this world that we seem to be in here. Every single moment we show up with this very

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:20.960
 convincing grand narrative, each of us, every instant. And it puts me at the center in an

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:26.520
 environment. And my view highlights all kinds of things in the space. What I pay attention

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:33.120
 to, what I'm frustrated with, what I'm thinking of now, the kind of taste I have in my mouth,

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:40.000
 what I'm expecting to come, the mood I'm in. Do I feel good about myself or not? Is there

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.280
 something in this situation I'm not comfortable with or something I really like? These are

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:50.920
 all layers of a view. It's literally a world I'm creating right now, this moment. So view

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:56.680
 isn't just like an idea to hold, like I'm in a mind only school view now. That's one

00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:03.240
 really big box way of framing view, which is what we're talking about as lineage blessing.

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:07.960
 That's one way of framing how available I am to connect with the nature, with reality,

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:14.520
 my own nature and other beings nature. That view, the aperture, the layering, the really

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:22.360
 like availability I am to have, to be in response of responsibly in touch with all the layers

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:33.760
 of interdependent reality. That's called a view. And in terms of receiving lineage blessing,

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:38.160
 how much I receive lineage blessing, how I understand what that even means depends on

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:48.000
 my view. And so one of the things I thought to highlight during this time is the amazing

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:54.440
 quality in Buddhism that it has this nested ecology of all of these views. And they all

00:09:54.440 --> 00:10:04.080
 interrelate in a really organic mutually communicative, totally comprehensive and coherent way. N

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:04.480
yingma

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:14.080
 school causes the nine yanas, the nine vehicles. And each of these approaches or vehicles,

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:19.800
 these views that then become meditations, that then inform our conduct of behavior,

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:29.360
 that then usher in a result or a fruition. Each of these vehicles is a whole world unto

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:37.640
 itself and every single moment it arises. The view arises right now, which what am I

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:41.560
 sustaining the view? That's the meditation. And how am I moving and speaking in space?

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:45.400
 That's my behavior. And then what is that going to lead to? What's the next moment going

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:52.200
 to be? That's the fruition. Every single moment I'm creating this world through my view. And

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:58.160
 Buddhism has all of these worlds. It's not, it doesn't believe there's just one preset given

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:03.400
 world out there. Just like it doesn't believe there's one preset given me in here. It all

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:19.080
 depends on the view. So to jump right in, there's four philosophical schools in Buddhism. The

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:26.680
 Vibhāśika, Srātrāntrika, Mind-Only or Chitamatra, and Madhyamaka or Middle Way. And they're

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:27.920
 defined

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:31.840
 differently. They're distinguished from one another by their view, meditation, conduct,

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:38.200
 and fruition. And each of these is an ecology. Each of these is a world. And they communicate

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:48.360
 with each other in a natural, organic fashion. So the first view, the most foundational Buddhist

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:54.480
 view, Vibhāśika. What does it believe? Will all of these schools function in terms of two truths,

00:11:54.480 --> 00:12:05.420
 relative truth and absolute truth? And Vibhāśika school functions, it posits the belief. I'm

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:05.600
 going

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:10.480
 into the view, right? We're just, this is in one way, heady philosophy, but it's actually the

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:16.080
 experience I'm believing in right now. What view I hold, it take for granted. The worldview I'm

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:20.800
 assuming right now, my grand narrative, it's happening right now, whether I see it or not.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:25.440
 So we're trying to see the different views I could hold so I can be more conscious of which one do

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:25.520
 I

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:32.800
 want to choose to turn on, or to turn off, or to brighten, or to dim. That's talking about like

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:39.760
 trying to be a more conscious participant of my experience. That's a practitioner in Buddhism.

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:49.520
 So the Vibhāśika school, there's two things in relative reality. There's self and other.

00:12:49.520 --> 00:13:02.080
 And self is defined in two ways. There's a stream of instance of consciousness, irreducible moments

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:08.560
 of mind in an ongoing succession, a continuum. That's one part. The second part is just the

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:17.360
 felt sense of me. I'm me. I'm the center of the universe. I'm ongoing in an uninterrupted

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:21.920
 fashion, and I'm more important than everything else. That's the typical sentient sense of me.

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:28.320
 And in terms of the other, there's two things. Time and space.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:36.080
 On the Vibhāśika view, they believe time is composed of irreducible units of time.

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:40.480
 There's a smallest teeny, teeny, teeny, tiny moment of time.

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:48.960
 And then space. There's a tiny irreducible moment of space. It's called a partless particle.

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:53.840
 So wow, this seems in one way really abstract.

00:13:53.840 --> 00:14:01.200
 Irreducible moments of mind, a felt sense of me, irreducible moments of time,

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:07.360
 irreducible units of space. This is the standard modern scientific view.

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:13.360
 They haven't found what it is. They're looking for tow, theory of everything, the theory that

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:20.640
 connects the strong, weak electromagnetic and gravitational forces to describe at least the

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:26.640
 material world. They're looking for what's the irreducible ground of reality. That's called

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:35.120
 modern science. They're still looking for that. Vibhāśika view, it doesn't assume a ground. It

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:40.000
 does assume these tiny little particles that all aggregate in these little bunches that then

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.960
 cohere into larger bunches and larger bunches into the bigger aggregates of a sense of me,

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:52.880
 mind, time and space. This is all a view. In an everyday world, we assume this view.

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:59.120
 If we're in a good mood, because usually I'm just want to hit somebody or something.

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:05.760
 It's not a non-Buddhist view. It's just like I'm thinking about my greed happening or I'm worried

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:11.760
 about this or I'm hungry. I'm not even looking at my mind at all. I'm just happening. Whatever

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:17.200
 view turns on, I'm not thinking about irreducible subatomic particles whizzing around and stuff.

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:24.160
 But okay, if we really tune into like what modern science has given us, it gives us according to

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:28.080
 more or less this view, Vibhāśika view. This is the first school in Buddhism.

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:36.240
 Saltrāntrika then says, okay, how would I ever know what the irreducible particle of time and

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:46.080
 spaces are this moment of mind? And they say you wouldn't. It's so fine. It's so small.

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:54.960
 And so what we ever know in Vibhāśika view is called a representational correspondence theory

00:15:54.960 --> 00:16:01.440
 of reality. I have an idea or an image or an impression that kind of generally represents

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:10.000
 or kind of overlays on itself onto what's absolutely true, which is these universal

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:17.040
 actual things that are there that I can never directly perceive. All I ever perceive is my

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:27.200
 representation of them. And this is like a teeny minuscule, like very fine tuned representations

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:35.600
 of mind and space and time. Okay, so I'm not ever in touch with an irreducible partless

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:41.920
 particle or something. I'm only ever seeing my perception of them. Okay, so that's basically

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:46.720
 real. I'm saying this is really basic. This is basic saltrāntrika view. Then mind only school,

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:52.000
 the third philosophical view says that makes no sense. In one way, they're pointing out that

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:59.440
 Cartesian duality makes no sense. How would mind and non mind ever interact? How would matter and

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:05.200
 non matter ever interact? If they're two fundamentally different things, you have a

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:10.400
 universal kind of essence of something. And then my representation of it, which is mind,

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:15.040
 how would they ever touch? Because they're two fundamentally different types of thing.

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:21.280
 So mind only school says it's all only mind. This is their fundamental view.

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:28.800
 There's only mind. It's just mind experiencing its own energetic habits.

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:37.360
 Mind awareness experiencing its mental ways of shaping and kind of representing back to itself.

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:43.200
 There's only mind. And then those habits can be imaginary, totally diluted, referring to things

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:48.320
 that don't exist at all, like a sense of ego. Buddhism says that's an imaginary object. It

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:54.240
 doesn't actually exist anywhere in reality. And then there's dependently arisen natures.

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:58.160
 There's actual ways that things do aggregate. Cause and effect does happen.

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:07.360
 And then there's actually on the absolute truth is yundra, true nature of mind or wisdom mind.

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:13.360
 But this mind is seen to be a truly existent mind. There actually is mind.

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:19.840
 This is a view. The view is it's all mind.

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:28.480
 Everything I ever experienced, remember, feel, anticipate, taste, touch, smell,

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:32.080
 it's all only ever mind. That's a view.

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:40.240
 And then manyamaka or middle way comes in as the fourth school and says, even that has an error,

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:47.720
 that view. And there's two basic ways of approaching middle way school. It's all taught by the

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:48.080
 Buddha.

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:54.320
 The first is, there's no such thing as anything that has inherent existence.

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:59.680
 Try to really find something that's singular, independent and permanent.

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:06.800
 Singular meaning has no parts. Independent meaning isn't dependent on causes and conditions.

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:13.360
 Permanent, unchanging. Try to find something like that.

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:19.440
 That would, if you found it, it would be called truly existing, true existence or inherent

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:26.000
 existence. And Buddha in middle way school, the middle way school Buddha said that is unfindable

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:32.720
 because nothing exists like that. Everything is dependently arisen. So that's a relative way of

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:38.720
 understanding mind only school. Then the absolute way of understanding mind only school is they

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:39.280
 said

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:46.000
 go beyond all conceptual designation. Even in having an idea that there is not a thing

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.520
 that's singular, independent, permanent. That's just an idea. That's the product of a way of

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:58.800
 thinking, a type of kind of holding the mind that produces images and concepts and representations

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:08.000
 like that. It's called duality mind or consciousness sem. They say go beyond sem and you'll find

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:15.760
 jhana or prajna, wisdom mind. It's not a thing. It's free of the four extremes. Doesn't exist

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:20.720
 or doesn't not exist. Doesn't both exist to not exist. Doesn't neither exist nor not exist.

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:28.080
 It goes beyond all conceptual designation. It's just how's it understood self reflexively through

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:38.080
 wisdom awareness. This is a view. So am I in a view right now where there's all these aggregating,

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:43.040
 buzzing, irreducible particles of time, space and mind? Am I in a view that says, hey, I'm only

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:43.360
 ever

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:48.240
 experiencing my own representation of what this is. I never can really actually know what's

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:55.280
 happening. I only ever know my filter of what's happening. Thirdly, am I in a view that believes,

00:20:55.280 --> 00:21:02.080
 oh, this is mind. Every single thing I've ever experienced is only mind. There's only ever mind.

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:09.440
 Or am I in a way of being that holds no position at all? It's total like flexible,

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:19.520
 omniscient, wisdom ninja position. It's just true nature arising endlessly, ceaselessly.

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:25.040
 Try to find it. It's unborn. Try to pin it down. It's not arising. It's not it's not abiding.

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:30.880
 Try to find where it dissolves into. You can't. It's unceasing. This is a view.

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:38.160
 This is the basis of Vajrayana Buddhism. So these four philosophical systems all happen within

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:45.600
 Jana's one, two, and three. It's called Travaka Jana, Prajekta Buddha Jana, Bodhisattva Jana.

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:51.200
 These four philosophical schools all happen in these first three kind of foundational

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:59.680
 vehicles. And in addition to that is Tantra. And that's Jana's four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:05.760
 So when we open up a conversation about receiving lineage blessings,

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:10.480
 the question that's most relevant is what is the view I'm holding?

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:18.400
 Because that will determine what I'm available of reality to experience. Like how fine is my

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:26.240
 attention, my awareness, how open is my heart to actually let reality inform my experience?

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:33.360
 That's just called receiving lineage blessing. Lineages, each of these ways, each of these sets

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:38.480
 of views that come with meditations, conducts and results, their entire world systems or

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:45.040
 ecologies and use any one of them. Use the one that works for you and it'll lead to liberation

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:50.240
 of oneself, of like one's mistaken sense of a self that's bound in these cycles of suffering.

00:22:50.240 --> 00:23:00.320
 They all will do it.

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:08.880
 Okay, so going to what makes you not a Buddhist by Zog's our cancer.

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:21.200
 Pidgey 108. The view is the core of any religion. At an interfaith conference, we may have no

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:21.600
 choice

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:27.280
 but to be diplomatic and agree that all religions are basically the same. But in fact, they have

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:32.640
 very different views and no one but you yourself can judge if one view is better than another.

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:40.640
 Only you as an individual with your own mental capacity, taste, feelings and upbringing can

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:48.240
 choose the view that works for you. This is a Buddhist version of know thyself.

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:54.160
 The view I'm assuming this moment, that determines what I see in experience.

00:23:54.160 --> 00:24:00.160
 So how available am I to receive lineage blessings? Because each of these views has

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:06.160
 a Buddhist lineage with it. They're not contradictory. They're mutually so

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:12.560
 enfolded within one another in a progressive inclusion that is more inclusive, more detailed,

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:17.360
 more directly expressive of the nature. That's how the nine yanas unfold as the view becomes

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:24.320
 more and more accurate. Three other quotes from this same book in this same chapter,

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:32.240
 it's the conclusion. This is just like throwing pebbles in a pond. Okay. One's inflexible

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:38.320
 self-righteousness takes up all the space that would allow empathy for others.

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:48.160
 My view. One's inflexible self-righteousness takes up all the space that would allow empathy for

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:48.560
 others.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:25:00.640
 Only my view is right. Right. Another one, page 115. When you see that you will never

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:08.160
 come to the end of problem solving, that is the beginning of the search for inner truth.

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:14.560
 When you see that you will never come to the end of problem solving,

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:17.040
 that is the beginning of the search for inner truth.

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:26.800
 This is a very middle way statement. There's no end. It just keeps going. So what are we

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:31.920
 going to do about that? Try to find a definitive boundary of your view, of your world.

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:37.040
 It's unfindable. So what to do?

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:42.960
 That's the question that really activates the search for truth.

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:52.880
 Nevertheless, 117, instead of worshiping truth and venerating sadhus,

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:58.960
 this is an age that worships billboards and venerates liposuction.

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:04.720
 Instead of worshiping truth and venerating sadhus,

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:08.480
 this is an age that worships billboards and venerates liposuction.

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:19.520
 If we only pay attention to the most superficial immediate attention grabbing features of reality,

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:26.720
 that's how much blessing we get. We get what's right in front of us. There's no more depth.

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:33.360
 It's just surface. We get a very superficial availability for receiving like to be informed

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:40.000
 by reality, by truth. That's a function of our own view, where our mind goes to and gets hooked in.

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:47.520
 And then lastly, even though these ecologies, these views, they all have this complete

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:51.360
 integrity and coherence within themselves as worlds that lead to liberation.

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:57.840
 Nevertheless, 122, Buddhism is not a survival kit for living.

00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:06.560
 Buddhism is not a survival kit for living. Buddhism is not designed to make everything

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:11.920
 you want to come true. It doesn't give an answer to all the questions you have. It doesn't even

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:19.040
 have an official marriage ceremony. Buddhism is about waking up. Buddhism is about freeing

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:23.840
 all beings from suffering and the causes of suffering. And we use life in this situation

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:29.200
 to the best we can with whatever's happening to actually engender the causes and conditions

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:38.000
 for freedom to happen. Not so we get a nice house. This is a really important point.

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:50.720
 Regardless of what view we kind of orient through, which is a question of our own mind,

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:56.480
 our mindfulness sees what view am I in right now because the view constantly

00:27:56.480 --> 00:28:02.480
 change if my mind is fickle. The view constantly changes. So in this book, this is such an

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:07.200
 important special book, "Ruby Rosary Joyfully Accepted by Vigidares and Dakinis is the Ornament

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:12.480
 of a Necklace" by Tinley Norba Rinpoche. This is about the life, all the previous lives of

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:18.560
 His Holiness Diju Rinpoche. It's so amazing. This book is a newish book. It's really, really

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:18.960
 beautiful.

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:23.840
 So regardless of which view and which ecology, which world system

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:30.640
 we ourselves are in, and we choose because I'm letting my mind be in that view right now.

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:35.760
 I have the full power to be in that view or not. It's my own mind viewing.

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:40.320
 So regardless of that, Tinley Norba Rinpoche says here on page 230,

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:44.720
 "For those of us who presume to be followers of the Buddha,

00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:50.720
 if we can each perfect our learning and contemplation within a particular jhana

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:56.640
 that corresponds to our individual faculties and inclinations with its own threefold system of

00:28:56.640 --> 00:29:02.960
 basis, path, and result, then even though it may seem as if we have not served the Buddha's

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:10.560
 teachings in vast ways, in fact it is the most beneficial and not allowing the teachings of

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:14.080
 Buddha Shakyamuni to be contradicted or ruined from within."

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:22.880
 Whichever view we show up with, whichever world we create for ourselves right now with my view,

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:30.480
 meditation, action, and fruition, as long as I don't break the internal integrity of that ecology,

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:39.040
 that world system, it will work. For example, if I go into a forest,

00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:47.040
 I have to work within the terms of the forest. If I go into the forest and just do whatever I

00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:55.440
 want in there, that's called breaking the forest. It'll disrupt what the forest allows, what it

00:29:55.440 --> 00:30:01.360
 affords, all the awesome things that its own internal ecology allows for. Similarly with a

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:10.320
 liberative system, our own mind has to show up and pay attention to the internal dynamics

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:17.920
 of how a view becomes a meditation, informs our conduct, and then leads to certain very specific

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:27.200
 outcomes. We can't just mix and match. We're the ones that have to show up with integrity,

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:35.520
 to actually listen to the world we're in, to be with it, not just to enforce our own

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:42.230
 wants and desires on whatever's happening around us. We actually have to, to some degree, surrender

00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:42.240
,

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:50.320
 be receptive to, responsive with what's happening around us. There's an internal ecology of my view

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:50.320
,

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:56.720
 there's an external ecology of all these things that are interdependently cohering and

00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:57.440
 communicating

00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:03.270
 with one another. Am I doing that in a cooperative fashion that's harmonious, based on good conduct

00:31:03.270 --> 00:31:03.360
,

00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:10.560
 good ethics, general reciprocity, a sense of care and concern, a tenderness and openness of heart,

00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:16.880
 a genuine respect and reverence of the sacredness of the amazing kind of special magic

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:25.120
 that every situation is this infinitely magical, nested system of all these causes and conditions

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:30.880
 coming together? Am I engaging that with a tender respect, a humble humility, a careful attention,

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:38.010
 or am I just enforcing myself on my situation? Am I trying to convert the world according to my

00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:38.640
 view?

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:44.080
 Buddhism is really against conversion, because people have their own ways of making sense and

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:48.880
 living life. Otherwise, it's really fundamentally violent.

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:58.160
 And it's only this Penaribiche, it's only this Penaribiche.

00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:02.960
 He has a book, Ocean of Blessings, Heart Teachings of Drubong Penaribiche.

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:10.400
 And here there's so many things, I mean there's so many books here of special things.

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:20.720
 Page 10, he mentions about a monk, Sunakshatra. He was the attendant to Buddha Shakyamuni for

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:31.440
 24 years. You ever heard of his name? Sunakshatra? The monk Sunakshatra was the Buddha's,

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:39.280
 was sorry, the monk Sunakshatra was the Buddha Shakyamuni's half-brother and served him for 24

00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:45.980
 years. He knew by heart all the 12 categories of the teachings of the Batakas, but he saw

00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:46.400
 everything

00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:52.720
 the Buddha did as deceitful. Eventually he came to the erroneous conclusion that, apart from an

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:58.880
 aura six feet wide, there was no difference between the Buddha and himself. So one day he told the

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:05.520
 Buddha, "apart from the light around your body six feet wide, in 24 years as your servant I've

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:11.840
 never seen even a sesame seed's worth of special qualities in you. And as for the Dharma, I know

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:22.320
 as much as you, so I will no longer be your servant." Sunakshatra served the Buddha for 24

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:29.360
 years and was totally unavailable to receive the blessings, the lineage teachings. He saw

00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:29.760
 everything

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:39.040
 the Buddha did as deceitful. He could recite all the all the Batakas, the baskets of the Buddha's

00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:45.920
 teaching, but it just, like water off a duck's back, none of it was allowed to penetrate his heart,

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:53.920
 to open his mind, to be in a state of receptive learning. It didn't benefit him at all.

00:33:53.920 --> 00:34:00.560
 Why? It's not that the teachings were erroneous, it's his own view was so distorted,

00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:04.800
 it was so self-convinced, it was so unavailable to learn anything,

00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:11.920
 that he didn't learn anything. Being around the Buddha every day for 24 years,

00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:21.520
 receiving lineage blessings. This is not some passive theistic thing, you don't just say I

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:28.080
 want something and you get it. You have to tune into the nature. You have to, if you want a view

00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:38.880
 that's more inclusive, you have to turn that on in your own mind. This is like a beloved thing.

00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:47.920
 Venerable Kenpo Sowendoni Rinpoche, they wrote this book, this is based on teachings they gave,

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:53.840
 "The Seven Nails, Final Testament of the Great Zogchen Master, Sri Sinha." Here, this is like,

00:34:53.840 --> 00:35:00.560
 almost like an unknown secret. In the very beginning, Venerable Kenpo Sowendoni Rinpoche,

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:08.880
 he personally wrote all these amages to the Zogchen masters during our time. These prayers here,

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:12.000
 they're so beautiful and he composed them himself.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:21.200
 The first is to the primordial Buddha Kunduzampo, the great protector, right?

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:29.040
 The moment the original appearances arose from the primordial ground, you recognized and liberated

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:36.480
 them, abiding in that natural state, beyond cause and result, completing perfectly the two merits,

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:40.320
 enlightened before any buddhas, homage to the first Buddha.

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:49.840
 He then goes on to pay homage to Garv Dorje, Manjushri Mitra, Sri Sinha, Guru Rinpoche,

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:54.400
 Vimala Mitra, Vyrochana, His Holiness Dhujhir Rinpoche, and Venerable Kenshin Paldhinshara

00:35:54.400 --> 00:36:01.760
 Rinpoche. Living lineage masters, to this moment and our experience, we totally depend on them

00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:09.280
 for the teachings we receive now. They've all come through them. These are the living

00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:17.440
 lineage masters that fully accomplish these teachings. So that's part of receiving lineage

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:23.840
 blessings. There's an outer way of just perceiving kind of in a more literal way. There's actually

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:30.160
 these lineage of masters, but what they're pointing to is if we go back to those four philosophical

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:36.960
 schools, there's not even a thing to point to. What, a teeny tiny irreducible particle?

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:47.600
 A teeny tiny figment of a fragment of a filter of an imaginary representation? Mind? They're

00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:54.160
 pointing to just mind? Like clouds in the sky? There's no pointer. There's no point to that.

00:36:54.160 --> 00:37:01.360
 There's no pointing. What is it we're praying to? What does it mean to be a living lineage master?

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:06.400
 What are we praying? This is like an actual blessing stream of wisdom,

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:12.880
 wisdom, an uninterrupted living wisdom continuum, because it's actually happening.

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:20.320
 Dependently arisen mere appearance like a rainbow in the sky.

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:26.480
 It's more real than anything else, and it's still just a rainbow.

00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:32.000
 But if we use this rainbow, if we tune into the wisdom blessings,

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:37.120
 this rainbow will help us see that everything is a rainbow. It's all lineage blessing.

00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:45.120
 If we tune into the teacher, they'll help us see everything as the teacher. They'll help us see

00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:50.480
 everything as the Dharma. They'll help us see that everything is the nature happening. This is all

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:57.200
 living Dharma. And if we have a view that big, that inclusive, it just means we become natural.

00:37:57.200 --> 00:38:01.680
 We finally just let go of all these ways we've shielded our view.

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:07.120
 We become fully receptive and responsive to lineage blessing. We become lineage.

00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:13.440
 Uphold the lineage. We're just being natural. We're upholding our naturalness.

00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:21.120
 The yoga, like that's the sense of yoga in Buddhism. We're just abiding in what's natural.

00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:26.160
 Or Vidyadhara, we're abiding in awareness, holding awareness of the true nature.

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:36.800
 That's this unfabricated view. This is a full, full interdependence, a full beyond any designation,

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:43.440
 total immersive experience of wisdom blessing, of receiving wisdom lineage.

00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:49.360
 But we need the supports to have this actually be a lived experience.

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:55.680
 We can't just recite teachings. And we can't just say, like Kempo Ramache says, often,

00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:59.440
 oh, I went to this teaching that year and this teaching that, and I got this wang and that wang,

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:03.200
 and here's all my protection cords and all that. This doesn't do anything for us.

00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:09.760
 Not if we just stay hard inside. Just becomes another thing of spiritual materialism, right?

00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:14.720
 Another way to bypass dealing with the difficulty, the challenge of living life.

00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:20.720
 This becomes a mere philosophy, a theoretical patch that eventually falls off.

00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:26.080
 We have to let the Dharma absorb into our hearts. And mostly we do that through compassion,

00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:30.880
 through actually caring about others. We're not so self-righteous

00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:34.880
 that we stop paying attention to other people's kind of lived experience too.

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:40.850
 These other beings, they help us with so much. We depend on them so intimately for everything we

00:39:40.850 --> 00:39:41.520
 have.

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:49.040
 So like this great master, Thukur Urjanirbhaje, repeating the words of the Buddha, it says these

00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:54.320
 two engines of enlightenment are devotion and compassion. Devotion is kind of more principally

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:59.600
 what we've been talking about here a little bit. This is page 63 in this first edition.

00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:05.840
 If we want to quickly awaken to Buddhahood, it is essential to unite means and knowledge.

00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:11.840
 Whatever conceptual practice we do should ideally be combined with the recognition of mind essence.

00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:17.040
 Devotion and compassion are the heart of conceptual Dharma practice.

00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:24.880
 The great masters of the cogulinus state that it is delusion to count on any method for recognizing

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:31.040
 mind essence other than purifying obscurations, gathering the accumulations, and relying on

00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:37.520
 the blessings of a realized master. This doesn't mean that no matter how smart or strong you are,

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:45.520
 sorry, this means that no matter how smart or strong you we are, if we don't follow a master

00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:51.920
 and instead stubbornly push ourselves through years of meditation training without developing

00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:57.920
 compassion and devotion, purifying obscurations, and gathering the accumulations, we will remain

00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:04.560
 deluded. The essence of both devotion and compassion is actually the same. It is a kind of love.

00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:09.760
 Whether that feeling is directed towards enlightened pure beings or ordinary impure

00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:15.840
 beings, whether it is devotion or compassion, the essence remains the same. The mind is laid bare

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:21.920
 of thoughts at the moment the empty essence dawns nakedly and can be directly perceived.

00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:27.920
 And the cogulinus devotion is always said to be the main quality to focus on. And so the cogulinus

00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:33.440
 is called the lineage of devotion. But compassion or devotion are the same in facilitating the

00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:41.040
 realization of mind essence. To reiterate, our training and devotion, compassion, purifying the

00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:46.640
 obscurations, and gathering the accumulations should be combined with recognizing mind essence.

00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:52.800
 Otherwise, to reach enlightenment using means without knowledge takes a tremendously long time.

00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:58.880
 Three eons, according to the Sutra path, the Vajrayana path is much more swift.

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:07.040
 So devotion and compassion make us receptive

00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:11.440
 to showing up for reality the truth for our own experience.

00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:15.520
 Devotion and compassion.

00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:21.760
 Almost done. You're great. Thank you.

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:26.160
 The Vajras sound of peace, practicing the seven chapter prayer of Guru Padma Sambhava. This is by

00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:33.920
 the Venerable Kempurim, which is this is a just treasure trove. I'm just like, pithy, like living

00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:45.680
 electric lineage blessing. This book is amazing. Okay, so here, page 217.

00:42:48.560 --> 00:43:00.080
 217. The Gyaqig is a vine or a creeper. It grows with other plants. In Tibet, it's used for herbal

00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:06.480
 medicine. And because it has red color, it's also used to dye woolen robes. The Gyaqig will not

00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:06.720
 grow

00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:12.480
 in high altitudes. And because it requires hot weather, it is sorry, it thrives mostly in southern

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:19.280
 Tibet. Guru Padma Sambhava used the example of the Gyaqig plant and the heat that gives it life to

00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:25.440
 make an important point about devotion. He said that if one's path is a field without devotion,

00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:31.040
 the sprout of enlightenment will not grow without trust and confidence in the three jewels. The

00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:36.800
 blessings will be very distant. This means that if we have trust and confidence in the three jewels

00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:36.800
,

00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:43.200
 the blessings will be very close. Guru Padma Sambhava continued by saying, listen, prince,

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:47.440
 the only purpose of the Buddhas and bodhisattvas attaining enlightenment is to benefit all beings.

00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:53.040
 Therefore, their beneficial activities for sentient beings are unceasing. Yet because

00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:58.000
 sentient beings minds are so densely saturated with the five poisons, and their ego clinging

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:03.760
 is so powerful, even the Buddhas and bodhisattvas who continually work to help all beings cannot

00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:09.040
 completely empty their sufferings and difficulties. Prince, since you want to help your own

00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:09.520
 children,

00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:15.120
 as well as all your subjects in Tibet, both now and in the future, as your legacy, tell them to

00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:21.360
 first develop infallible confidence and trust in their hearts. And with that infallible devotion,

00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:25.280
 they must absolutely rely on the three jewels and pray in the following way.

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:33.840
 And then Guru Rinpoche goes on to recite the prayer to Prince Mutri Sempo, which is one of the

00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:34.160
 seven

00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:42.720
 chapter prayers here. So in these different ways, I've been trying to open the sense of what is

00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:52.720
 devotion. Because it's not a theistic path in Buddhism. It's not a blind faith path. The Buddha

00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:57.280
 encouraged us to look for ourselves. And fundamentally, that comes down to look at how

00:44:57.280 --> 00:45:04.640
 my own mind is looking. What view am I holding? And whatever view I feel comfortable with holding,

00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:09.280
 as long as it's one of these Buddhist views, meaning an audience with compassion towards

00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:16.470
 actually looking towards the truth, and maintaining that inquiry until we realize the truth. As

00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:16.640
 long

00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:23.440
 as it's one of those views, we will wake up. We will become free of suffering and the causes of

00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:31.200
 suffering. It's so many masters have accomplished this according to all of these yanas. So we have

00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:38.160
 to find out which one I'm comfortable with and pursue that inquiry and keep going and be

00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:44.720
 intelligent about what supports that inquiry to keep going. What helps keep me open to the living

00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:50.800
 dharma and my experience? What are the supportive conditions that make that come alive for me? And

00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:58.160
 they change over time because my view changes. So I have to check in with what's my view now,

00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:02.560
 and not just what's my view now, but I have to fabricate if my view now is not so healthy,

00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:06.160
 it's not so lined up with being natural with a dharma, with compassion, with devotion, with

00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:12.560
 renunciation, bodhicitta, pure perception, then I need to turn those on. I need to fabricate that.

00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:17.840
 It's called using duality to go beyond duality. This is a very Vajrayana essential point.

00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:21.920
 So the last thing to end on a fun note,

00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:31.680
 the lion's roar, an introduction to tantra by Shuryam Trungpa Rinpoche. This is, I think,

00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:36.800
 maybe one of the earlier editions. Lion's roar. I was randomly looking through this. There's just

00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:41.920
 so many, all these teachings nowadays, it's like we're, there's so many available dharma teachings

00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:48.640
 that are reliable. I mean, it's just astounding. There's not so many people who read them or

00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:52.960
 practice them even less, or they always say that, you know, it's each time we go further on the

00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:53.280
 path,

00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:57.440
 it's like less and less people will do it. And it's true. I mean, I know for myself, you know,

00:46:57.440 --> 00:47:02.480
 like, it's like, you know, I'm a finicky practitioner, I'm a finicky dharma person,

00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:07.920
 you know, some day's nice, some day's not, you know, it's very fickle and trying to make myself

00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:13.280
 more steadily receptive to being in touch with reality. But here we go. The lion's roar by Trungpa

00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:25.600
 Rinpoche, page 116 in this edition. Okay. So, receiving lineage blessings. Self-ego tries to

00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:32.960
 maintain itself and develop its territory. Should that be encouraged or discouraged? Should we try

00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:41.200
 to maintain our selfhood or should we not? What would you say? Then there's a question and answer.

00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:50.800
 Student, who should? Trungpa Rinpoche, I beg your pardon? Student, who should try to maintain

00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:59.760
 itself? Trungpa Rinpoche, who is he? Student, should we? Who? Trungpa Rinpoche, who is we or who?

00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:07.360
 Student, should we try to maintain ourselves? Who is we? Trungpa Rinpoche, I'm asking you.

00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:13.360
 Student, I don't know. Trungpa Rinpoche, who is that? Who is that?

00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:24.880
 Silence. Trungpa Rinpoche, did you say you don't know? Student, well, I suppose who is that?

00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:32.960
 Trungpa Rinpoche, yes, but who isn't that? Student, who isn't that?

00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:40.560
 Trungpa Rinpoche, moreover, what are you talking about? Laughter, then silence.

00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:50.640
 Trungpa Rinpoche, who are you? Student, I don't know. Trungpa Rinpoche, why don't you know? Why?

00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:58.240
 Student, there's no way of answering the question. Trungpa Rinpoche, why not?

00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:05.760
 Student, nothing works. Trungpa Rinpoche, why should it work?

00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:17.440
 Silence. Trungpa Rinpoche, it's not a matter of conmanship. Things don't have to work.

00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:27.910
 Let's warm up. Why should it work? Who are you? Why should it work? Who are you? Why should it work

00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:28.240
?

00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:34.720
 Student, it just stopped.

00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:41.840
 Trungpa Rinpoche, stopped. Student, the questioning.

00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:50.800
 Trungpa Rinpoche, where does it stop? Where? Where?

00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:58.640
 Silence. Trungpa Rinpoche, how come it stopped there?

00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:05.680
 Student, I guess you can't focus anymore. Other things start happening.

00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:10.720
 Trungpa Rinpoche, understand that.

00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:20.400
 We all show that common symptom. So much is happening that we find the whole thing bewildering,

00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:28.560
 unable to focus on any one particular thing. The whole thing is bewildering, bewildered,

00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:36.880
 constantly bewildered, constantly all over the place. We are so confused, bewildered, subject

00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:43.600
 to confusion. We are a victim of confusion. What shall we do? Shall we stay, try to get some sleep,

00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:48.960
 get some food, or shall we try to get out of it? If you try to get out of it, it means putting in

00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:55.600
 a lot of energy. Trying to get out means creating some kind of scheme so that you could get out of

00:50:55.600 --> 00:51:01.840
 this prison. Could we do that? Couldn't we do that? How can we do that? Do you want to get out

00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:12.800
 or do you want to stay in? It's very inviting, smooth nest, like being a worm. You could regenerate

00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:18.560
 your next generation. You could retain yourself constantly by being a worm, or you could stick

00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:40.000
 your neck out by being a crocodile. You could. So a beautiful quality of Buddhism, of every view in

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:51.400
 Buddhism, it dissolves itself. It dissolves itself into a greater view, a more natural way of being

00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:51.520
,

00:51:51.520 --> 00:52:00.160
 a more inclusive way of communicating. It self-composts until we don't hold any view

00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:07.520
 so that we can equally engage all the views with love and compassion and wisdom.

00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:15.920
 When we try to play little tricks with our own views, little language games, when we try to avoid

00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:21.980
 being responsible for what view am I in now? What world did I just create for everyone to have to

00:52:21.980 --> 00:52:22.240
 be

00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:30.480
 in? When we keep kicking that can down the road and we don't take actual accountability and

00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:40.320
 responsibility for the view that my mind is in right now, then we become unavailable to receive

00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:52.240
 lineage blessing. Because we think we know it all. We have a view, it has a boundary,

00:52:52.880 --> 00:53:01.200
 and anything outside of that boundary which is basically infinite reality, we're unavailable. Why?

00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:07.840
 Because we set that boundary and we were convinced that that's the way it is. My view.

00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:15.440
 And that fundamental fixation or grasping is exactly what we have to dissolve in Buddhism.

00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:18.720
 And this is the only way to receive lineage blessing.

00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:32.480
 So little by little, we'll continue on the path. And every session, every moment of nundro,

00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:36.480
 every moment of presence, every moment of heart-felt compassion and love and tenderness,

00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:49.200
 of wisdom, of wakefulness, it all matters. Every little bit opens up our view. Every bit of virtue,

00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:57.440
 every bit of empty, kind of empty, flexible, full awareness helps our own view be informed by more

00:53:57.440 --> 00:54:07.120
 reality, by more truth. In Buddhism, we're so fortunate. All these nested systems, all these

00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:13.200
 worlds that we can explore and enjoy. But when it comes down to it as practitioners, we have to

00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:13.520
 pick

00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:19.840
 one that we're in, and we have to do it with integrity, according to the internal coherence

00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:26.400
 of that system, that view. Otherwise, we make a total mess of it.

00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:34.000
 And in the end, it'll just be time we spent being a Buddhist for a while until we decide not to be,

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:38.640
 and go into, "Oh, the desert gets boring, so then we want to go to the ocean."

00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:45.520
 And we've all committed as bodhisattvas and Vajrayana. We're not going to make that mistake.

00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:51.600
 There's no place to escape to. Interdependence, there's no way out of interdependence. And we've

00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:57.840
 committed to staying here until every single being is free from being stuck in some self-made

00:54:57.840 --> 00:54:58.240
 corner

00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:03.600
 of interdependence. We really made that heartfelt commitment. I'm like, "I want to honor that

00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:08.160
 commitment. I've made that promise aspiration." And little by little, take these steps connecting

00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:13.760
 to the lineage blessing by doing practice, opening, poisoning myself to connecting to the nature,

00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:18.640
 seeing how I close up, releasing again, again and again and again and again,

00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:23.600
 until I'm not convinced there's actually some problem to solve. This is just interdependence

00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:28.800
 happening. This is just a dream happening. Then finally, I can relax and just be natural.

00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:35.990
 Then today, it's called that. That's really the final view, boundless, endless, kind of incon

00:55:35.990 --> 00:55:36.400
ceivable

00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:42.080
 view. Thank you, friends. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:58.080
 So for receiving lineage blessings, after exploring very quickly some of the different views

00:55:58.080 --> 00:56:02.240
 that we might be holding in our mind, and therefore how we're shaping our experience,

00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:10.960
 our reality, our world, I thought to emphasize that it's actually a really simple opening of mind,

00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:17.760
 an opening of heart, to really connect to the lineage, to connect to this kind of this powerful,

00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:25.920
 the wisdom, the compassion, the tenderness. It's just right there available. And I think it's very

00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:32.160
 safe to say that each of us have experienced like a moment of just awe and wonder and kind of this

00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:40.000
 grace and a total empowerment in the sense of uplifted goodness and just natural, fresh fulfillment

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:40.000
.

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:47.760
 It's not this foreign thing. I think each of us have tasted that. We've been in that. We've seen

00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:54.240
 that. And the path is just kind of being that way more, being more available to that. And I think,

00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:59.200
 as we all know too, especially for Buddhists, Buddhist practitioners, we're studying and

00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:06.070
 practicing the path. It's a very involved process. And there's a lot of tenderizing moments to

00:57:06.070 --> 00:57:06.480
 again

00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:12.480
 and again release this grasping we have, this fixation. It's quite a sticky process to honestly

00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:18.720
 look at, look in my mind, look in my habits, and to put the energy to release, to set down some

00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:23.360
 of these negative habits and to cultivate the virtuous ones and just really let go and relax

00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:28.960
 to really surrender to that goodness. It's very involved. And we have that

00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:38.080
 just amazing fortune that this, in that process of undoing, of self-dissolving, which means of

00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:47.440
 self-opening, of including more, we, there already is this infinite field of like boundless wisdom

00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:53.440
 and compassion that we're supported by. A Dharma brother once said, you know, I think a lot of the

00:57:53.440 --> 00:58:00.960
 path is just getting enough energy that we break through the atmosphere and just line up into the

00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:07.440
 orbit of the lineage blessing stream that's already happening. And we're kind of in one way just

00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:07.680
 trying

00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:15.200
 to get enough launch energy to get out of our usual orbit of me-hood and just to like let

00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:21.520
 ourselves be natural and like in that tiny opening shift, like the blessings are there.

00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:26.880
 These great masters are there. Their wisdom presence is there. And like as the final

00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:30.800
 end to this like statement, I'm not just making this up. Again, in Penner Rinpoche's book,

00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:37.600
 Ocean of Blessings, on page seven he says, "There are many practitioners who've realized the nature

00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:43.840
 of mind and attain perfect enlightenment just by doing guru yoga. Being introduced to the nature

00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:49.120
 of one's mind can happen only through the master's blessings and without the blessings nothing will

00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:54.880
 happen. This is not something that can be bought and no matter how learned a scholar you may become

00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:54.880
,

00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:59.520
 without a qualified master, it's not possible to recognize the true nature of mind.

00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:04.960
 As this is the root of the practice, without blessings, there's no way to attain enlightenment

00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:10.640
 and the path to Buddhahood is blocked. There's no other way to discover the nature of your mind.

00:59:10.640 --> 00:59:14.800
 You can't buy it or find it anywhere other than through the blessings of a qualified master.

00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:21.600
 That is why the single most important practice in Dharma is guru yoga. And that is why the single

00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:28.160
 most important practice in Dharma is guru yoga. And then he goes on to this say two pages later,

00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:33.520
 "Whether those blessings enter your being depends not on the object of your devotion,

00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:39.600
 but on your own mind. We've all heard this story about the old lady who had incredible faith and

00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:45.280
 devotion towards a dog's tooth, thinking that it was the Buddha's tooth. Though it was just a dog's

00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:50.080
 tooth, she received the Buddha's blessings and attained enlightenment, which was due not to the

00:59:50.080 --> 00:59:58.000
 tooth, but entirely to her strong faith and devotion." So just this simple turning of mind

00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:04.560
 or opening apart in one way, it's so simple, but it makes all the difference. So yeah, be brave

01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:10.240
 and bold like the nature is there to support us. So really, thank you for continuing on the path,

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:16.160
 all of us.
