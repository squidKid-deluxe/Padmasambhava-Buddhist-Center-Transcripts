NOTE     "synopsis": "Vajrayana Master & Nyingma Scholar\nVenerable Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche\n\n\u201cEssential Dzogchen Teachings on the View, Meditation, and Conduct\u201d\nby the Great Master Shechen Gyaltsab Gyurme Pema Namgyal Rinpoche\n\nJanuary 19, 2023\n\nPBC Palden Sherab Pema Ling Retreat Center:\nLotus Land of Glorious Wisdom\n18190 131st Trail N\nJupiter, FL  33478\n\nEmpowerment of Guru Padmasambhava as Guru Vidyadhara \nRevealed by the Great Terton Tsasum Lingpa\n(Sunday Morning, January 15 - In Person Only at Pema Ling in Jupiter, Florida)\n\nGuru Padmasambhava gave a variety of teachings to benefit future generations. Among these, in the Vajrayana, connecting to your teacher is essential to invoke the power and beauty of the nature of mind. Therefore Guru Rinpoche gave many teachings on how to practice on Guru Padmasambhava, many of which were hidden by the wisdom dakini Yeshe Tsogyal.\n\nThis particular terma was revealed by the famous terton Tsasum Lingpa in the 17th century, and is considered one of the blessed and powerful practices for connecting to Guru Rinpoche as a sambhogakaya emanation known as Guru Vidyadhara. This terma is a condensed practice of all three Inner Tantras of Mahayoga, Anuyoga, and Atiyoga.\n\nThe Dzogchen teachings are the highest and most direct teachings of the Buddha Shakyamuni on the nature of mind. They show us how to discover our own inner beauty and realize everlasting peace for ourselves and all beings. Ven. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche will give these rare and essential heart instructions according to the great master Shechen Gyaltsab Gyurme Pema Namgyal Rinpoche. These direct and profound teachings impart the critical points and central supports for all practitioners to maintain to keep our practice fresh, alive, and beneficial for everyone.\n\n\u201cIn brief, to recognize your own nature is the view.\nWhen you abide within it, that is the meditation.\nAnd if you have no attachment, that is superior conduct.\nWhen you arrive at the primordially free fundamental nature, that is described as the fruition.\nAll are included in the natural state beyond concepts.\u201d\n\nShechen Gyaltsab Gyurme Pema Namgyal Rinpoche (1871-1926) was the reincarnation of Orgyen Rangjung Dorje, and was the fourth regent of Shechen Monastery. Shechen Gyaltsab was the disciple and heart-son of Mipham Rinpoche. He also studied closely with the First Great Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo and the First Great Jamgon Kongtrul Rinpoche, among many other extraordinary Nyingma and Sarma masters. He focused for many decades on the key points of Creation and Completion Stage practices. Shechen Gyaltsab excelled in all three activities of the learned--exposition, debate, and composition--undertaking the three practices of listening, reflecting and meditating for his own benefit, and the three activities of teaching, debating and writing for the benefit of others.\n\nVen. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche is a holder of the complete Buddhist Nyingma lineage of study and practice. He was enthroned by H.H. Dudjom Rinpoche as a Nyingma Abbot. As an accomplished scholar and Vajrayana master, Rinpoche has an amazing ability to convey profound topics simply and directly, making the rich, vast ocean of Dharma accessible and easy to put into practice.\n\nwww.padmasambhava.org\nwww.pbdc.net",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.990
 In the great master problem of the teaching, what is known as "You don't know" holds my perfect

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.400
 teacher,

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:14.960
 and all comes in the shallow. And there you come, you have many of your books, many of you have,

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:24.480
 and you read it. They explain all that. But this is very simple part. Maintain lineage teaching,

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.240
 according to Vaidyana teaching, or Buddhism, or the new master book, and Buddhism is really

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.800
 important.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:39.760
 If it is not lineage teachings keeping up, that means what? Breaking the Samayas. We deluded our

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.920
 duality conception to the authentic natural teachings. And what is the teaching said?

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:54.320
 Sharnish the lineage, golden change, bridges, a complete kind of mixing out with things this and

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:04.480
 that way, that, with spoiling. Buddha's teaching is teaching of the known duality.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:13.600
 It is not duality. It is not public. From the known duality, it is not duality. From the

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:21.120
 wisdom states, these teachings are, came with compassion, loving kindness, and wisdom.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:31.600
 And for that reason, teaching is Buddha. Really, even Buddha. For that reason, the Buddha said,

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:38.720
 the teaching said, "Don't upset, don't say that I will leave this world, or I will bend my body in

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:50.400
 the water. You should know. I will come back with my teachings." Teaching. My teaching is me.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:02:02.480
 I am, that teaching is me. If you like to see the teaching, Buddha, practice that you will see the

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:10.880
 Buddha. Really, this is what we deluded that. Teaching is authentic teaching. Teaching that

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:19.280
 design for the emotions, negative emotions. As I said earlier, what you all know,

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:27.600
 Buddha gives us 84,000 different teachings. That is 84,000 different negative emotions.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:37.040
 21,000 for the attachment emotions, 21,000 for the anger emotions, 21,000 for the inner

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:44.560
 emotions, 21,000 for all cognitive emotions. That is emotional. And that, this teaching is

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:52.960
 medicine. Transform, or acumen, acumen, change, transform. This is what this teaching is.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:01.360
 That emotions of human beings are same. Same. At the ancient time, emotions,

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:08.720
 you need to have stories of them in a vinaya teaching. Emotions are same. They have anger,

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.400
 they have attachment, and it's not something to put on. Or this time, we don't have anger,

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:20.800
 we don't have attachment, we don't have anger, we don't have guilt. No. We have all that same.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:30.880
 Therefore, teaching is designed forever for all the negative emotions. As the water or element,

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:39.040
 the water of this, our water, the ancient water, or more than what we call it, it purifies

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:50.160
 the dudes. It did ancient time, it doing now, it will do future. It will remove our pasting.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.560
 First, it did ancient time, it did now, it will do. Every change in the water

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:06.400
 puts something different. That is what's called diluted water. That is diluted water. Unhealthy

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:14.720
 water. Water is organic. Ancient time and modern time, or even the third world countries, believe

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:23.040
 it is organic, exactly as it is. The ancient time, what Buddha drunk drinking, or what Buddha

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:30.640
 that drink, that water is the same. Similar purpose, similar usage, and similar benefits.

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:39.040
 So therefore, according to Buddhism, and according to a human school, lineage is very,

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:47.680
 very important. You are lineage holders, also. And the Sangha members are the lineage boarders.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:57.440
 Sangha members are the boarders of teaching, not by anyone. Buddha taught the teachings,

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:03.600
 but holder of the Dharma, the message, the principle message of the Buddha is teaching.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:11.680
 That is the principle among our three audiographical groups. Buddha Dharma is the principle.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:23.360
 Sangha was whole, and that is known as holder of the teachings. So that's it.
