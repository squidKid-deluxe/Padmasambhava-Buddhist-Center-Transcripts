00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 So speaking of powerful, we have to practice. And now he's using all the different tools.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.790
 And just without practice, if he knows something, he's not going to benefit at all. He won't get

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:17.000
 full benefits.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 And therefore, we have to practice. That's the simple way to explain.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 So here, now, again, in this same mind, you look these days, and now I've missed those lines,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 but he said, "Every living being has Buddha-nature."

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 And that, of course, is explained before, many times, and said many times.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 So everyone has Buddha-nature, all which is known as "Tathangata-garbha."

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 "Tathangata-garbha."

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 Buddha-nature, and that Buddha-nature in Dzogchen teaching, "Salt-book awareness" or the "Ruppa."

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 That is so. Everyone has a Ruppa. No one is out of this.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 That Ruppa is the seeds, cause of the Buddhahoot, food.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 That is a Buddhahoot. It will bring the Buddhahoot. That is a Buddhahoot-nature.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 Oh, in life, it will bring as a Buddha-summon, the badra or the "vegethara" of the Buddha's food.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 Like the Sattva status.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 But even though it has that, even you know that, we have that color,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 you know that, then if we don't practice, we won't get enlightened.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 We won't discover that beautiful potential, beautiful nature.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 Then we will be same as before.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 Before, nothing is really going to change.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 So therefore, he is encouraging, after you receive the teaching,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 after you know the practices, put that into practice.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 If you like to get full benefit, as explained before, power and all these things,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 every minute, this all only comes by practicing.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 Only comes by meditating practices, combination of the wisdom and compassion.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 That will bring the result.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 And everyone, if you practice this, or anyone practices this,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 now he is talking, if anyone practices, there is no excuses.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 Every practices, there is no excuses, everybody gets realization.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 You don't have to make any excuses.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 Everyone is the same, everyone is the equal, everyone has a right, everyone gets the result.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 Doesn't matter what situation or circumstance that you have having externally,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 but if you practice it, everyone gets.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 And here you say, if you practice it, practice it, everyone will get, everyone will be liberated.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 Everyone will be liberated, it is another terminology of the enlightenment.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 Everyone will get enlightened.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 We are liberated, for example, liberated.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 We are liberated to that organized state, to the robust state,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 the self-born awareness states.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 From where we are liberated?

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 From the duality world, from the world of conception,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 we are liberated to the state of the primordial Buddha,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 the self-born awareness.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 And the great, brilliant, robust status, we become the Buddha.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 And because you are liberated, there is no difference of excuses,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 you have to make anyone, there is no difference between whether you are smart or not smart.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 Everyone has the same potential, everyone has the same qualities,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 and this is so, because also he is explaining, this practice is so simple.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 You don't have to be fancy, logical, philosophical, and I do it, and reach, and this and that.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 It's so simple, it's so easy, it's just so simple.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 Being casual, being relaxed, be only as we are.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 That's what I really talk.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 You say, there is no difference between smart or intelligence or not intelligence.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 Tell me, say, oh, where do you start?

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 No difference at all.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 That's it. There's many stories that is also, for example, I mean, teaching said,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 one time, there's one similar here.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 Nyanthala, even if you practice it, anyone practice, even that is so many times called,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 very dumb, it can't do anything in the samsara world activity,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 and just send better to send to upper animals, animals or cows.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 Even that person will be getting enlightened.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 Can't do anything in the samsara, any kind will be used for activity,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 except for going to upper animals or cows.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 Even that person will be getting enlightened.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 There's a story, this is in the teaching said,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 Nagarjuna is sitting, of course, Nagarjuna is a great master,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 Nagarjuna is a great scholar, Nagarjuna is my great Mahasada,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 and so he's a meditator practicing in hermitage, in the modern areas.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 And there is then a very dumb person, or not really smart one, and cowherd.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 Cowherd, I think, later I think his name is called loy sancha.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 But however this cowherd comes there, a brave scholar around with Nagarjuna's meditator,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 he comes there, there and there.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 And soon after this cowherd has become so comfortable with Nagarjuna.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 Nagarjuna, and he always comes to see Nagarjuna.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 And then later he started bringing some murk to him, to Nagarjuna.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 And he's so happy always to see Nagarjuna and coming there again and again.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 And then afterward, when he was really devoted, he liked to stay there all the time.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 Somehow he didn't, but he didn't know anything, he was so dull, dull-minded.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 Dull-minded and not doing anything.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 That's what they sent up to him, up to the cowherd.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 And so now, Nagarjuna, if he didn't know anything,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 Nagarjuna jokingly asked to meditate.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 Meditate can't stop him, he don't know how to do it.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 Again he didn't.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 So Jogran and Nagarjuna said, meditate, cow.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 Cow.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 So the cow has been so many times, a long time with the cows.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
 So, Nagarjuna now said, meditate on the cow.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 So he meditated on the cow, and the tiki said that.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 Because his concentration is so strong, even if it's dull.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 His concentration is so strong that even he really developed the cow horns on his head.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 And now he's really blocking his movements.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
 Because the horn is blocking.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 So now, Nagarjuna, oh really, he has a good concentration.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 Now you meditate, meditate, meditate.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 You don't have a cow.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 You don't have horns.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 And he also did the same thing, and then that horn is gone.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 Now here's the easy.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
 And then Nagarjuna gave the example and stopped him how to meditate.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 This time, he meditated, he became one of the great Mahasidha, or the greatest siddha.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
 And known as luya satcha.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 Luya satcha in the Tibetan world have translated the enlightenment of naga.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 So Nagarjuna's, I think, name he called luya jangchak.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 Nagarjuna is ludak in Tibet, naga bodhi in Sanskrit, naga bodhi.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 Nagar bodhi, he become really great, great Mahasidha.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000
 And this is generally, in the teaching, always said, in the Vediana teaching,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 Vediana practice, who will reach the enlightenment so fast?

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:41.990
 The first one is so devoted, so joyful and smart, that devoted individual will reach enlightenment

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:43.000
 very fast.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 The second one is so dummy but very stable.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:59.000
 Dummy, stable, stable, that will reach enlightenment quickly because his mind is so stable.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:05.000
 He don't think so many, many things, he is concentrated strongly.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 And therefore, every stage as it is, as the instruction, they are reaching, reaching enlightenment.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
 So there are two parts.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 One is very smart and a devoted one, and the other is a dummy and stable.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.850
 Stable, stable, stable, stable, stable, stable, stable, stable, and that really will reach

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:31.000
 enlightenment, as like naga bodhi in the teaching system.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 So here, here, say the same thing.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:49.000
 Even the cow head will be liberated, enlightened.
