00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.240
 Thank you for coming and thanks for participating and being here for one month. It's not a short

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.760
 time.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:15.240
 In the meantime, you have to make so many things for the rest of your day and make this to come

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.160
 here.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.640
 It's not just a symbol. I'm very grateful and thankful. And also, I admire your courage and

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.400
 commitment, joy for the practices.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:34.660
 So again, that's so wonderful, so special. And for that reason, again, we all think this is what

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:35.760
 you're doing.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:43.240
 Really to bring that with more joy and appreciation. And we may become one of the great cause to

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.200
 bring joy and peace, happiness to the whole world and beyond.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:55.200
 And all the time, not just one kind of shock, but continually, really for all beings, six rams,

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.790
 ripple ethics and continuously echoing through the galaxy, through the universe, through the soup,

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.200
 all the samsaras, benefiting one up another, endless.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:12.200
 As actually in the teachings, when you dedicate the merit in the vastness of the dharmakaya, like

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.720
 as in the Buddha, some of the Bodhisattvas, some of the Buddha and the medhichiri did, then that

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.200
 merit, they're never going to demolish it or finish it.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.490
 It's continually going to ignite that. And it's therefore the gracious teacher, Buddha Shaktamuni

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:33.200
 used examples that if you drop one drop of water in the ocean, it's not going to dry up.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:40.250
 That drop of water will be dropped in the ocean, it'll last, until the ocean is dried up, it will

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.200
 remain.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.700
 Similarly, whatever do the merit, good things, we dedicated that for vastness of the dharmadhatu,

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.200
 vastness of all the sentient beings,

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:59.660
 until sentient beings have reached the enlightenment, that merit will continually ignite in their

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.200
 ripple ethics, one after another, it is really going on and on.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:08.290
 And for that reason, to kind of secure the merit, same time, to increase the merit, one of the most

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.200
 important is to delegate the merit, as in the teachings said always.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:20.200
 That's the work we do, pause, story seven, accumulate, seven techniques that accumulate the merit

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.200
 or sometimes translate the seven limbs.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:31.200
 And that, one is the merit, the dedication is so powerful, it's lasting long, it increases,

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.200
 increases all time.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:39.340
 What the teaching said again, as the drop of the water, if you put it in the ocean, that will

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.200
 dissipate until the ocean is dried up.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.790
 Similarly, what we dedicated the merit for all the sentient beings, without any kind of expectation

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:55.200
 or regret or anything, we dedicated that really, that that merit will never going to break it up,

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.950
 until all the sentient beings are reaching enlightenment, everyone. That's what, here's the example

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:01.200
.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.830
 So therefore, I mean, this one, you're making this time and coming in and all this is not just an

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.200
 insignificant, particularly this busy town of the world, really, you make a big effort.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:18.200
 So really kind of that, bring up that highlight and dedicate it to the every living beings.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.880
 It's just a very, very beautiful merit, beautiful, beautiful, the practices, beautiful town of that

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:24.200
.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:31.200
 And for that reason, what the great master, Umm Khimba said, always do that.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:38.720
 When we practice, always kind of that practice combined in three novels, beginning novels, middle

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.200
 novels and concluding novels.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:48.200
 I said it so many times, K.T. Bhattachiran would say it so many times, and I'm sure you heard this

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:48.200
 from so many other great masters.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.100
 So I'm not going to repeat those things, but this one, that novel, Umm Khimba 3, the third one is

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.200
 the dedication and aspirations, aspirations.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.380
 That is what it is. So therefore, again, this is our little motivation of the joy and the

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.200
 appreciation.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.190
 And you talk with the vastness motivation of the both each other, as we know, and then purely

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:14.200
 understanding of the Dzogki teachings or Dzogki practices, Dzogki practices.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:21.200
 Dzogki practices, we talk as Dzogki practices, but reality, Dzogki is our nature, your nature.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:29.390
 We will be going through this, this teaching. It's just bonding out what we are inherited, what we

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:33.200
 have, and how we're going to revere that nature.

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:41.200
 First and time, even though we have this nature, it's not fully spotlight or fully is glowing.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:49.200
 This teaching is instructing how to revere that nature, bring it up.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:56.360
 And what is Dzogki? Dzogki is fully enlightened status, fully enlightened status, like Kri Gaya

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.200
 status.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:04.630
 Then there is nothing else enlightened status in the Poseidon three Gaya, in the accord of Buddhism

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:05.200
 or Māyāna or the Vedayana.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:12.500
 Dzogki is a three Gaya status. So revelation of Dzogki means reaching the enlightenment and

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.200
 discover the enlightenment.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:21.130
 Where discover the enlightenment is accorded in the Śukaryāna teaching, it takes three countless

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.200
 years to reach and become the Buddha.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:29.200
 That evening the teaching said the highly culpability of the person.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:34.200
 Highly culpability of the person will take three countless years.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:41.200
 How they do? The person develops both each other and the second, they continue accumulated to merit

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.200
 through the six paramatas or the ten paramatas.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:51.200
 Then finally they are reaching enlightenment. Those are highly culpability of the practice.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:59.200
 Midyong Capability practical is the same manual, same system, but it takes seven countless years.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:06.280
 And the third kind of culpability individuals in the teaching said it will take thirty true, I

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.200
 think, over thirty countless years.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:14.600
 When we are talking about three countless years, high culpability individuals are called Śukar Mah

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:15.200
āyāna.

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:22.940
 That which gracious teacher, kind and competent teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni himself said he was the

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:27.200
 one of the great culpability, high culpability individuals.

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.200
 For him it took three countless years.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:36.860
 In Dzogki teaching we are not talking about three countless years. We are not talking of one or

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.200
 three lifetimes.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:45.200
 We are talking in these lifetimes. In these lifetimes.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:50.200
 In this timeline we are discovering three guys or the enlightenment.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:56.200
 Those people, again, even Dzogki practitioners are known as the highest culpability practitioners.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:02.830
 But there is also a core and kind of practical level. There is a high culpability of Dzogki

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:04.200
 practitioners,

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:10.200
 medium culpability of Dzogki practitioners, and third culpability of Dzogki practitioners.

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:16.200
 High culpability of Dzogki practitioners, reaching enlightenment within ten years, twelve years.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:22.590
 Those are the teachings of Dzogki's secondary hearing that we went at a long time ago, our great

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:25.200
 kindness teacher, K.G. Baddishar,

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.200
 what you told those teachings, teachings.

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:33.510
 Teaching reaching enlightenment within these lifetimes as we consider what story we are talking

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:34.200
 about.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:43.300
 And then when Mejichiri Mataras, Gaurav Dorji, Mejichiri Mataras, as well as Shiri Tsumas, and Jana

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:44.200
 Sothras,

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:53.200
 all those are, when you read life stories, they are like just a regular individualist, very smart,

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.200
 very generous,

00:07:55.200 --> 00:08:03.200
 generous, smart, but their courage and commitment, their dedication, their devotions,

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:09.200
 their both each other is so deep, so vast, so open.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:18.270
 Because of that, their reaching enlightenment within that lifetimes, within those lifetimes,

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:19.200
 reaching enlightenment,

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:26.200
 including Jeju's secondary hearing. And Ishim Surya, of course Ishim Surya is always that he is,

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:33.200
 she is the emanation of the Swara Sothi and the regular Swara Sothi and the Sankhi Jema,

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:40.930
 or the Buddha Lajjalas, and all that. But again, when we read life stories, she re-went through

00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:42.200
 step-by-step,

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:50.060
 step-by-step, and how much she put in dual of the practicing, courage and commitment, asset

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:51.200
 practices.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:59.770
 That means that asset practices, what Mejichiri, behind the scenes is courage, commitment, determin

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:00.200
ations,

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:07.690
 not lingering, not wavering, not kind of swinging thing, thought every situation, I call the

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:09.200
 emotions,

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:17.860
 staying firm as solid mountains, strong and steady, what is the user name, Asavajalas, then

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:20.200
 discover enlightenment.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:27.200
 And all those looking practitioners, when we line up this, everything, everyone, really looking

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:27.200
 back,

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:33.200
 and all this tale of the practitioners, and this, all this, from the life of time,

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:40.060
 Gurbi Masambhav and Gurbi Manamathar came to Tibet and then great translator Veroja, then they

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:40.200
 shared the teachings,

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:46.570
 so many, chain of the golden mountain, the lineage masters, who completely actualized these real

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:48.200
izations, one upon others.

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:54.610
 And when we read life stories, they are not just calm like that, glorious, beautiful, when we talk

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:55.200
 that.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:10:03.170
 They are as normal human beings, full of all the chaos of the samsara situations, dilemmas,

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:05.200
 troubles, these and that things.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:11.200
 Really, when life is on and on, as long now, looks like, same thing.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:19.840
 But they are courage again, the devotion, determination, commitment, putting the practice, without

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:21.200
 doubt and hesitations,

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:27.470
 kind of lingering back and forth, back and forth, not continuing the movements, with full of

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:28.200
 satisfaction,

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:35.200
 confident, put the practice into the heart, and then they become the winner and victorious.

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:44.200
 That is what really the practice is. So this zoki practice is, is practice of our innate nature.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:50.200
 Your innate nature, my innate natures, we are revealing, we are glorifying,

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:57.550
 we are kind of bringing out the midst of the dualities, and very fast, very quickly, very

00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:59.200
 powerfully bring out.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:04.200
 And for that, the tattoo is so powerful, so spiritual, so beautiful.

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:13.890
 Yet, I will tell you, if we add this toga-like feel, then it will rapidly discover of our inherent

00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:15.200
 natures.

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:20.200
 Our glory is beautiful. Bring out that completely, that.

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:23.200
 And that in the zoki teachings, it's not just in the zoki teachings.

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:26.200
 Buddha Shakyamuni is generally the Mahayana teachers.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:29.200
 We all inherited this tathanga-garbha.

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:37.890
 Tathanga-garbha has no strength between men and women, women or men and women and animals, whatever

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:39.200
 species we are.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:43.200
 Everyone contains the tathanga-garbha.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:49.200
 There is no difference at all. That is everyone's potential.

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:55.950
 So in the zoki teachings, that potential is instantly revealing through the techniques, simple

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:57.200
 techniques.

00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:03.470
 You are revealing that instantly, midst of the heavy darkness or the habiji patterns, you bring out

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:04.200
 that.

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:07.200
 That is really the toga practices.
