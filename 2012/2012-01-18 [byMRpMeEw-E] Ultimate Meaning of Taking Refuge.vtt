00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440
 "Then ultimate taking refuge, this is what it is here. This is according to Dzogchen level.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:15.360
 This is what the statement used here. It's ultimate state with taking refuge. And this is all our,

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:23.920
 at the Buddha Dharma Sanghasa, no other than our own, this present awareness. Our present awareness

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:24.080
,

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:33.840
 our present, our mind, the nature of the mind is embodiment of Buddha Dharma and Sangha. It is

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:41.410
 source of everything. Everything comes from there, from this our awareness. And this is what it's

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.840
 called,

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:49.440
 called the fundamental ground. One's own awareness is the father who generated the Buddha.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:01:00.480
 This is our ultimate foundation of ground, our ultimate nature of the mind.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:14.880
 It is the openness or it is emptiness aspect of the nature of the mind is the Buddha. This is

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:25.040
 emptiness. And this unceasing clarity, even though it is open and emptiness, but it's not negation

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.040
 or

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:34.000
 the black hole status, it is arising unceasing energy, energy of the clarity, clarity. That

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:43.920
 energy is then the Dharma. That arising energy of the awareness, this intelligence that just to

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:44.480
 begin

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:52.240
 this, just at the drone of that, drone of the, drone of the beginning of the energy of the

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.280
 awareness

00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:06.240
 is the Dharma. That is Dharma. And then union of that emptiness and arising energy, that is Sangha.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:12.240
 That is Sangha. So this is when you look to your mind or to our mind.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:23.670
 Moment you look to your mind, what we find is open. It's empty. There's nothing that we can explain

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680
.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:34.240
 That is the Dharma. So that is Buddha. Even he didn't find anything, there is all this intelligence

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:41.920
 arising. When you look to that nature of the intelligence or that energy, it is again that

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:51.360
 moment is empty. This arising energy is the Dharma. Then it is all the intelligence kind of figure

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.760
 out

00:02:51.760 --> 00:03:00.400
 all these things coming up, one minute this coming. This is, is Sangha. So this is ultimate, the

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:07.970
 absolute Buddha Dharma Sangha. This is in the Dokti teaching said, what? You heard this. It's

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:08.160
 called

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:18.160
 Moo, Ravi, and Tuggi. Moo, Tunga. Nature not, the awareness, nature of the awareness is natural,

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:25.360
 is empty. Empty, that which is open in the Dokti teaching. So that's the Dharma. The awareness,

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:37.600
 emptiness is Dharma. And the unceasing energy, clarity, that energy, clarity aspect of the

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:46.640
 awareness is sampokai. That is Dharma. Then unceasing emanation of this all consumption,

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:54.720
 what we have, all different consulsions is namakaya. That is a Sangha, Sangha.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.600
 And even though there's all the aspects that we can see, but where they are,

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:09.600
 what those are, where this you can find, there's nothing substantial solid that we can pinpoint

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:20.720
 anything, anything. That is known as the natural, where things are. So therefore, this, this

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:32.240
 nature of our mind is absolute Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, or the absolute state of

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:45.600
 dharmakaya, sampokaya, namakaya, that all is right in here, right in here. And that energy,

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:52.320
 that call it, then we can name it as, as like in the channel level, channel, or in the essence

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.880
 level,

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.320
 that is the blissfulness. That is good blissfulness. Therefore, in the Vediana teaching

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:04.480
 open said, the entire universe is a mandala of the blissfulness of the emptiness, not just

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:15.120
 in the Vediana teaching, making kind of like wake, wake or the false claims. Once we discovered our

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:21.920
 nature of that blissfulness or that nature, nature, everything is that because what we see,

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:29.760
 what we hear, what we think is our mind or your mind. What do you think? What do you see? What do

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:35.760
 you hear? What do you feel? Nobody can deny that is their mind or that their feelings.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:46.240
 That's what, how the mind controls and overpowers, every, our perception,

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:54.640
 consumption, our destination, our environment. And stand and understand, discover this nature,

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:04.960
 natural. Then we are known as masters of the natural, natural. So here, therefore, again,

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.280
 with this understand here, already in this teaching, so some of the group members, somebody,

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:15.840
 I take refuge in the nature. This, this is also three jewel, Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, external level

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:15.840
,

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:23.760
 and the inner level, there are guru, Deva and Dakini, take refuge, three jewel and three roots.

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:32.800
 And I said here, I said, so that is briefly meaning of this refuge, refuge place. Again,

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:38.160
 this ultimate bliss here, we say this is the ultimate technique of refuge or kind of the more

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:45.760
 ultimate technique of refuge, I call it jokti levels, level that our, our mind, our nature of

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:52.800
 the mind is embodiment, Buddha, Dharma, Sangha. And therefore then I, with this understanding,

00:06:52.800 --> 00:07:00.080
 I make strong connection with that. I keep that knowledge up with, with trusty, with confidence,

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:06.240
 with joy, trigger that I find today or trigger that I discovered by teaching with the Buddha.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:13.440
 I'm going to cherish and I'm going to uphold that. With that, with that determination, with that

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:20.960
 commitment, with joy, that is known as then, the taking graphics.
