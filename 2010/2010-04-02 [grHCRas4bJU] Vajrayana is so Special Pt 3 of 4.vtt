00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.560
 The habitual beings always have the five negative emotions.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:14.570
 When the negative, the five negative emotions and the poisons are at their rating as like, like

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:15.720
 strongly.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:23.060
 Here it is the Tomati, the Kariya, the Thomati, the Rasa, the Drava, the Kita, the Kishi, but not

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.400
 Mati, because at that time,

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:34.640
 whenever that happens, the practice should have the methods or the skill that instantly liberated

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.440
 within its own status.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:01:01.230
 And that means like five negative emotions such as ignorance, attachment, anger, jealous, and eloqu

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.440
ence.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:11.100
 Whatever the negatives are, rating and disturbing to the mind streams of the practitioner, so all

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.640
 the combination of those.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:18.800
 Whatever that happens, and right that moment, immediately practicing the truth,

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:26.360
 practicing the truth, remember the teachings or the Dokti teachings and then liberate it within its

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.240
 own natural state.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.040
 All right, and that's all.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:12.240
 And then, now that is the second ingredient or the necessities of that which is remembered.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:23.240
 And third, remember, even with now the right practices, even with doing every teachings and joy,

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.040
 devotion, all that,

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:32.040
 but then always that kind of this, cynically the distractions comes.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:43.890
 Distractions is very, very sneaky, and they are very, in a way, naive and very loky, but it is

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.840
 beginning to disturb.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:56.640
 And this distraction is, in a way, connected with all and affairs.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:03.640
 So whenever we are distracted, at that moment, again, the restful mind forms.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:10.640
 Instantly, this all and affairs, this distraction is the obstacle.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:16.640
 It is vengeance. It is not blessings. It is not achievement.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:27.640
 And therefore, right immediately, again, not let go under the power or of the destructions,

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:33.640
 with the games, according to games, between hope and faith.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:44.640
 And that is the thought necessary.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.640
 And then the fourth instruction is about the practitioners.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:04:00.640
 In order to maintain the dharma practices, then we should try to keep the samaya pure, pure samaya.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:08.640
 So that means pure samaya or pure morality or pure vows for the ethics.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:20.640
 And in order to do this, to maintain that, then we should have the s token that simulates as the ar

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.640
chery,

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:36.640
 keeping the strength of the bow very, I think, nice.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:42.640
 And the strength of the bow, when the arch is ready to shoot the arch or to the target,

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.640
 that the strength of the bow is not too tight.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.640
 They are not keeping too tight, and also not too loose.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:05:01.590
 It's just part of the balance, and that will give the arrow, kind of the speed of arrow, or it goes

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:02.640
 so nicely.

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:08.640
 Therefore, the samaya, the morality, that what we should have to be maintained,

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:17.640
 but with balance, with it, more gentle, more peaceful, more kind of freedom starts.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:24.640
 But strength and courage, and that should be there.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:36.640
 That's like the archery, keeping the strength of the bow as exact as it should need.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:46.640
 And those are four necessities for the practitioner to maintain the practices,

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:54.640
 not just maintain, but bring the full provision of the practices.
