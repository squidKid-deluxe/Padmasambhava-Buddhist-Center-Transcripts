00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 This is wonderful and beautiful. And before again, always in the teaching or the practicing,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.440
 whatever we do, the virtuous activity or Dharma activity, always in the teaching, say the Masters,

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.020
 in the teaching too, they read "correct" or "motivation".

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.040
 And that is so important. Motivation is the everything.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:31.250
 So the "correct" and "motivation" well make the corrections for everything correct and good. So

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.040
 good motivation will bring good result.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.850
 And then also can be negligent motivation, breath and diligence. And bad motivation, well again,

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.040
 consequently, is bad.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:51.040
 So it's all dependent on the motivation. Therefore, every teaching says correct motivation.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:58.150
 That means we have many motivations, good, bad and little, so variety will be made. But among them

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:03.040
 we activated good one, that which is good for us, good for other things.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:09.810
 And that is our practice. That's what we all here talk about, to really learn, to do something

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.040
 better and good in the bright of our lives.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.160
 Now, in the future, and not just for ourselves, we need to combine the body, just like to make that

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.040
 to everyone, all living beings.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.860
 And that is our goal. That is what the great Master Buddha told. And that's what he did in "Gurub

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.040
aya Masambhato", in all those great Masters.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.640
 So, we try to correct the good one, motivation. Motivation, among all the motivations, we say there

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.040
 will be three or four motivations this time.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:45.240
 Postable joy and applicateness. It's so important. Joy and applicateness. And that is so many

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.040
 reasons. You know, I don't have to explain all that.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:55.050
 We have really so many good things, wonderful situations, circumstances, break up that goodness,

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.040
 goodness.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.180
 And of course, we have some weaknesses and difficulty troubles, but since we are going to

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:10.040
 practicing of the goodness, miracles, so we activated that, brightening up that, we would call it.

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:17.290
 Let it kind of dispel all those something which is not good for us, or which is the obstacle. That

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.040
's how we do.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.910
 The good motivation is as powerful as medicine. It will fuel all those unnecessary, unhealthy, not

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:31.040
 unbenefited, but be cruel, removed.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:37.550
 And that all depends with us. So therefore, the highlight of the good motivation starts with joy

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.040
 and appreciation.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:46.070
 That is really important. It's simple. It's very pale. Basic things, many times before, oh, that's

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:47.040
 the basic.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:53.960
 But this basic is so important. We know the basic, we want to survive. Therefore, this basic is

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.040
 important.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.560
 Rainbow joy, more appreciation, many reasons that joy and appreciation. Second is not that joy and

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:09.040
 appreciation is kind of only localized, ourself that promote that second motivation is bodhicaka.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:17.760
 What is always in the teachings is vastness, motivation of the bodhicaka. Why is it called vastness

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.040
?

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:25.840
 Because there is how many sentient beings, numberless sentient beings or vastness, number of the

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.040
 sentient beings, we cannot put on a number.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:37.040
 It's vastness. So therefore, our bodhicaka like to reach out all those vastness sentient beings.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:43.480
 For that reason, vastness, motivation of the bodhicaka. All sentient beings to benefit it, to

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:51.050
 remove their suffering, difficulty, troubles, now and in the future and then find an enlightenment

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:52.040
 goal state.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:59.610
 That is our single wish of the bodhicaka. Like to everyone, we really glorify it and show it their

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.040
 organ status.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.040
 Status. So that's what vastness, motivation of the bodhicaka.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:15.340
 Which is the heart essence of teaching of the great teacher, Buddha Shakta Muni. Where there is

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.330
 aggressive Buddhist school teachings or Mahayana teaching, Vedayana teaching is all best on this,

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:22.040
 this, one foundation, this.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:27.040
 And we don't have that. Our foundation is shaking. Our foundation is not strong enough.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:33.070
 So at least when we do the practice and meditate a good thing, activating that, really we, we

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:38.580
 gathered and took and here, exploring the teaching of the Buddha or the teaching of the Buddha and

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.040
 made that we benefit all demon beings.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.180
 Again, as I said yesterday, in a minute time, I said, thinking of a Buddha is not just something

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.040
 isolated, call it that we're trying to invite.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:56.960
 We'll think carefully what the teaching of the Buddha is, loving kindness, is a companion, joy and

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.040
 peace, happiness to ourselves, to all, like that is what the teaching of the Buddha.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:08.040
 There's nothing else beside that. And free from the grasp, free from the claims.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:17.040
 Also what the greatest teacher says. That is so sublime, so natural, so beautiful. So beautiful.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.040
 There's nothing higher and better than those qualities.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:26.040
 If we have joy and peace, happiness, what else we need more than that?

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:32.040
 All joy and peace, happiness. Wow. That's the lala land, good people.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:41.040
 Lala land, what building? Sukhavati. Amitabha's building. Sukhavati. Joy and peace, happiness.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.930
 So that means that joy and peace, happiness, Sukhavati, what building, Amitabha is not something

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.040
 part of strength.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:53.040
 Right here. That is like our own home, home sweet home. We bring up that cause.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:59.340
 Please. There's nothing better than that. Free from the grasp, we cling, we're not restricted, not

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.040
 kind of close up that.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:08.040
 Opening as sunshine, even more powerful than sunshine. Radiating every direction.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:17.040
 The direction of that, love, joy, peace, happiness. That is so special, so powerful.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:23.040
 And it's very basic, it's natural. It's not something that we have to go and get somewhere.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:29.040
 It's right here, right with us. So that is what the greatest teacher would highlight.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:37.230
 I like it. Bring up that. For that reason, Buddha is openly known as a teacher. That's an unsurpass

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:38.040
able teacher.

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:44.100
 The who taught the teaching. Buddha himself said, I'm just teaching, I'm just showing what I

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.040
 learned.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:52.040
 What I learned. That's what Buddha said. So that's what he showed only now.

00:06:52.040 --> 00:07:00.040
 We are all the incumbent, all the goodness, all is with us. It's not something that we're lacking.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:04.040
 Lacking is only that we don't put our doing for effort.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:12.040
 Confidence and devotion, appreciation with that God. That is lacking, absence.

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:19.430
 Then we're ending with the third motivation is what? Motivation is beauty, understanding, or pure

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:21.040
 perceptions, of beauty.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:29.830
 That is very un-teaching. Again, it's not very un-teaching, it's something extraordinary or

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:31.040
 something that we break the stage things to ourselves.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:38.040
 According to teaching, reality level, everything is pure. That means everything is enlightened.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:44.040
 The poem is enlightened. Song is enlightened. Mind is enlightened.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:49.040
 We don't see that now, even though it's enlightened. We don't see it.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:56.120
 Why? I say it too many times and you know, the Buddha said, because of the grasping, because of our

00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:00.040
 clinging, because of our ego clinging.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:07.530
 Belongness, you see, that God is completely surrounded. Ego clinging is kind of darkness. It's just

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:09.040
 a surrender everywhere.

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:14.040
 It belongs to that. The beauty, the nature, call it as it is.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:20.880
 And therefore, even though we don't see immediately, reality level, nature, everything is beautiful

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.040
, beautiful.

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:28.880
 So therefore, the pure perception and beauty, understanding, is opening the window of that, toward

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:30.040
 that direction.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:37.610
 We don't like to stay in a dark corner all the time. We like to open 360-degree angles of the

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:39.040
 purity as it is.

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:44.040
 That is religious. It will look like a risk. Don't do that.

00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:51.040
 We always stay in one corner and look in one direction and just always look into our fingertips,

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:52.040
 fingertips.

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:56.040
 Then we won't see anything completely blocked.

00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:02.040
 And our even finger becomes those, like we won't treat some animals. It's all blocks and needles.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:07.040
 That's how looking narrow stays, makes so narrow everything.

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:15.040
 So for that reason, those are and so good with that. Then the devotions is so important.

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:21.220
 Many of the things, kind of like those scholars, intellectual, all devotions, maybe to religious or

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:22.040
 something,

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:32.020
 kind of make those stories, make those words and it looks kind of like demolishing the gauntlet and

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:32.040
 the beauty and richness and power of the devotions.

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:39.040
 Truly it is more about it. But when you have the devotion, you have the richness qualities.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:44.040
 You feel confident. You feel happy. You have settled, not just wondering everything.

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:50.040
 Every direction is like blind person. We really begin to settle, feel the richness.

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:55.610
 And this time we are connected to what? Devotion to the love, devotion to the compassion, devotion

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:57.040
 to the body together.

00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:04.040
 This is our principles. It's not just a vague, kind of petty story that is unnecessary.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:09.040
 All those great masters, great practitioners who read, become as we always say,

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:13.040
 "Oh, great master this, great master that, great master that."

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:25.040
 They had unpaid, uncharitable devotions and devoking great courage, commitment, joy, effort.

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:31.040
 And then expanding the realization and beauty, all that brings.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:38.040
 And we want to get some understanding, realization in our lives. Those are so important.

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:44.430
 And we don't want to get just like that. Then of course there is freedom. We can do whatever we

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:45.040
 like.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:54.620
 But we like to change, we like to discover our inner quality as we are talking about those great

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:55.040
 masters,

00:10:55.040 --> 00:11:00.040
 such as Runkinpah, such as great master Mararepa, such as great master Yimunlungpah

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:03.040
 or even Buddha Kshatyamuni himself.

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:12.060
 Talk, read their life stories. How much they have strong devotions, strong confidence on that, what

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:13.040
 they do so.

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:19.040
 And then they become, they are great, as they are great beings, but yet so simple,

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:26.040
 so humble, drawn to the earth, so practical, so full of common senses, common senses,

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:33.040
 so mingling everywhere. They are more common sense, more practical than even we think we are.

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:40.040
 They are more calm, more peaceful, more soothing, for very low key. Simple.

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:43.040
 That's what these great masters, great masters.

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:46.040
 So therefore all those motivations are really important.

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:51.040
 And of course you all know, I know, is in a way reminded to each other.

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:57.040
 I am reminded to myself, reminded to all us, we should all stand firmly on this ground

00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:01.040
 and then let explore our inner beauty, inner quality.
