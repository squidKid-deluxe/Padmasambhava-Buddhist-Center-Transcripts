00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.160
 So again, this is the practice in Dharma. Dharma is again not just the Dharma like it is as of

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.000
 again.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 We all know it's nothing strange. We come back to our nature's causes.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 They are primarily our nature, not to take over our self with strangers.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 Strangely is negatives, and violence, anger, jealousy, all those negatives and strangers.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.290
 Strange is taking over our self mental status, and then it ended up with all difficult troubles to

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.000
 our self and others.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 That pervades pretty well the nature's cause of our self, which is your and everything's cause.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 When these girls become stronger and stronger, meaning if they become stronger and stronger,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.420
 then it happens to others and to our self, and that is known as one-way habit, good habit, or

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.000
 learned habit.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 So when that's stronger and stronger, then we become known as Buddha.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 So now completely we discover, kind of removed all the negativeities that has no spirit place to it

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.000
.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:21.150
 We follow our mental strength, our divine mental status, and only the good qualities, only that the

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.000
 natural qualities are completely shining without any blockage.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 And that is then known as the God of all or the enlightenment.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 [Hindi]

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 And this is how when Thi Pa Chant will get the enlightenment,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 which you kind of do love in this good college, in the mind, in the systems, again and again, again

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.000
.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.470
 That again, in the teachings, it's not just again coming from outside, but pretty much in my bad

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.000
 college, again and again.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 We need to become that. Then we become more stronger and stronger in the allied status,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 and it's also known as habit in one way, it's good habit.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 And good habit is become very easy to our self.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 Self, and then that is how all the development in the Buddha's teachings,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:42.650
 and also part and ten movements, those things are developed again. I mean, one after another, as we

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.000
 develop this realization,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 it changes in it, and then it also changes externally. So that's how the practice goes.
