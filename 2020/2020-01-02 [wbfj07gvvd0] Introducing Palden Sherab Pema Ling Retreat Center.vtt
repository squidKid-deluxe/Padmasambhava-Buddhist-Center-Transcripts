NOTE     "synopsis": "Introducing Palden Sherab Pema Ling, Lotus Land of Glorious Wisdom, a Buddhist retreat center being built in South Florida.\n\nPalden Sherab Pema Ling is located on ten-acres of land that includes a pond, numerous trees, fields, and wetlands that are enjoyed by abundant local wildlife.\n\nWe\u2019ve already begun construction of the main meditation temple. The horse barns are being converted into a temple, meditation sanctuary, and fellowship hall, and the land will be preserved as a park-like setting for contemplative walks, meditation, or simply sitting in quiet reflection.\n\nThe Palm Beach Dharma Center\u2014a local branch of the Padmasambhava Buddhist Center\u2014is looking for funding to create this beautiful sanctuary. It will be a place for spiritual rejuvenation to promote natural beauty where outer peace and harmony, foster inner healing and tranquility.\n\nIts namesake is Ven. Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche, one of the great Tibetan Buddhist masters and scholars of the 20th century. He and his brother, Ven. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche, long dreamed of creating a Buddhist retreat center in South Florida. With the help of your kindness and generosity, this dream could now become a reality.\n\nDonate here:\nwww.gofundme.com/f/develop-dharma-center-in-jupiter-fl\n\nPlease visit the Palm Beach Dharma Center website for more details:\nwww.pbdc.net/palden-sherab-pema-ling-retreat-center\n\nThe International website of the Padmasambhava Buddhist Center:\nwww.padmasambhava.org",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:27.300
 The temple Rinpoche's had dreamed for years of creating a retreat center in the beautiful

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:34.540
 Florida countryside, a place where Buddhists and others could engage in tranquil reflection,

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:43.660
 deep meditation, and authentic retreat. That dream began to be a reality in 2014, when

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:52.300
 we found the land that would become Palden Sherab Pema Ling, Lotus Land of Glorious Wisdom,

00:00:52.300 --> 00:01:02.160
 named after Ven. Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche, who passed into Mahaparin nirvana in 2010.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:09.060
 A little over 10 acres, with a cypress grove, three pole barns and a house, and hundreds

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:19.260
 of trees, Ven. Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche saw what it could become. After careful planning

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:27.740
 and preparation, we worked together to transform the property, tending to the cypress grove,

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:35.200
 planting hundreds of new trees and shrubs, and creating a beautiful Buddha garden. Then

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:42.700
 we turned our attention to the central barn, converting it into a Buddhist temple, opening

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:50.260
 up the interior space, bringing in natural light, and enclosing the exterior to define

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:59.800
 the sacred space. We planned to unveil this beautiful temple in early 2020, offering a

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:07.420
 new and unique home for the Buddha Dharma here in South Florida. We welcome you to join

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:14.980
 us on this journey and to contribute to our efforts in whatever way feels best for you.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.820
 We hope that you will join us in celebrating the endless compassion and loving kindness

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:21.340
 of the Buddha.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:50.700
