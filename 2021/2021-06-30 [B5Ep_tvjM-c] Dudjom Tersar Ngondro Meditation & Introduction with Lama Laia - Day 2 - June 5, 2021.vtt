00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 So we'll just have a few moments of silent meditation. Everyone arrive and then we'll begin.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 (Bell)

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 We'll do the breath purification.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 (Bell)

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 (Bell)

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 Thank you.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 We'll begin or continue with our beginning.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 We'll be using these two main practice texts, I think everyone knows,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 but our daily prayers, the treasury of precious mantras and prayers,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 and then also the Ngondro sadhana.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:59.000
 So to begin, we'll begin by feeling the presence,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 invoking the presence of Guru Padmasambhava,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 reciting the 7-line prayer and our lineage prayers.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 So maybe we'll start in this daily prayers book, page 14, if you need.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:27.000

 Please give your supreme blessing to this place.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 Please give me the four initiations of the supreme practice.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 Please remove demons, misguidedness and obstacles.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 Please grant the supreme and ordinary siddhis.

 Om Maham vajra guru pedma siddhi hum

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 Om Maham vajra guru pedma siddhi hum

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:56.000
 We'll continue on page 24. Let's make the mandala offering to the three jewels

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:04.000
 and requesting the teaching to unfold in our minds and hearts clearly and for the benefit of all.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:16.000
 Sajipu cukshim metokram rira bling ji nide jen padi

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:24.000
 Sanjay jing tu mikte pul wahi roku nam da jin la cupar show

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:32.000
 Vidam guru ratna mandala kam nayata yami

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:38.000
 Sim jin nam ji sim padaan rohi che trag jitawar

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:46.000
 Che chung tu mukte pa ye jochi kolokodu so

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000
 The earth anointed with perfumed water and strewn with flowers

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.000
 Mammeru and the four continents ornamented with sun and moon

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000
 By offering them visualized as a buddha field

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.000
 May all sentient beings enjoy the pure land

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:09.000
 Vidam guru ratna mandala kam nayata yami

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.000
 According to the wishes of sentient beings

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.000
 and their capacities for the high and low, common and uncommon vehicles

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 please turn the wheel of dharma

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:43.000
 So again, thank you and welcome whether we're here in the room

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:50.000
 and then also all sharing the same time and place in this precious world

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:59.000
 at this time in the mandala of our beautiful teachers

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000
 and we're here at Padmasami Lane

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.000
 and I think maybe most of you were here last week

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:10.000
 but in case anyone's new, thank you, welcome

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:18.000
 Kim Po Sei Wong Rinpoche very kindly asks that we share our Saturday afternoon nundros

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000
 with the sanghas at large for anyone interested

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000
 especially those practicing the nundra

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000
 to have a little sangha time together, to practice together

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:35.000
 and then also to just reflect a little bit upon these teachings

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000
 and practice of the nundra

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:44.000
 which we all know encompasses all of the Buddhist teachings

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000
 all of the practices

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:52.000
 and so what we're thinking to do with these days, with our time

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000
 is to reflect a little bit on the nundra

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000
 and then mostly do the practice together

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:05.000
 and so whether you're new to Buddhism in general

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000
 whether we've been practicing for years

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:15.000
 the nundra is just so beautiful way to engage

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.000
 I think anything we could reflect a little bit upon with nundra

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:25.000
 of course it's beautiful to take it into our practice of nundra proper

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.000
 but because it embodies all of the Buddhist teachings it's all good

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.000
 and all going to be of benefit if it is

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.000
 and I just thought to say from the beginning a few people wrote

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:43.000
 and just asked questions about receiving transmission

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:48.000
 for these teachings and for the practice in particular

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.000
 and so that is something very traditional

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000
 it's always very good to have the blessings of the lineage

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000
 as we're engaging with our practice

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:04.000
 and so traditionally it is good to receive empowerment

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000
 and blessings to receive what's called the lung or the transmission

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000
 where someone who's been practicing

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.000
 and especially has some realization of the teachings

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:20.000
 reads them and we receive the blessings to take them into our own mind and heart

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.000
 and then of course receiving the teachings is important

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:29.000
 but most important is that we practice

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.000
 Kim Po Se Wong Rinpoche has said very clearly that

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.000
 anyone who wants to join the practice is welcome

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.000
 and has his blessings and his encouragement to practice

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.000
 there's these few little minutes and moments we'll have to talk a little bit

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000
 and reflect on the teachings

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000
 there's many teachings on YouTube

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000
 there's our PBC YouTube channel

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:00.000
 there's so many books by our venerable teachers as well as others on the nundra

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.000
 so you're welcome to do that

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:07.000
 and then of course we're in kind of strange times with the COVID pandemic

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:12.000
 but when the time comes definitely people who really want to follow through

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:17.000
 with making this part of their daily practice can and should

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:23.000
 we'll see what we can do to come and receive a transmission in person

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:28.000
 with Kim Po Se Wong Rinpoche or if you know someone else carrying the lineage

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:33.000
 so I just wanted to say that to start so please feel free to join

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:43.000
 and last week we went over very briefly what nundra is

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:48.000
 and kind of went through what it is, what the sections of the practice are

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:53.000
 and so we were thinking to just continue with that pattern

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.000
 as we're cycling through week to week with this

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:06.000
 and so last week was maybe almost a blur as to what we did and went over

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:11.000
 but we'll just start in the beginning and we'll move our way through

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:17.000
 so we thought today would be kind of again setting up the circumstances

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:22.000
 for our practice looking at what are called the three frames

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.000
 or the three noble ones and then also with our nundra in particular

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000
 to some degree start to look at the sections of nundra

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000
 like we mentioned there's many nundra practices

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:41.000
 and nundra means foundation, what goes before or what's the essence

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:50.000
 the source, the heart of any and all truly beneficial practice

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.000
 nundra has all those elements and so we'll go over those sections

00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:00.000
 basically there's two nundras, there's outer nundra or kind of common nundra

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.000
 common foundational things to take into our mind and heart

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:13.000
 and then the uncommon extraordinary nundra of the practices in particular

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.000
 and so we'll go over those as the weeks go

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.000
 a few people had asked about especially the mandala section

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.000
 so we will go over that, I'll send out an email

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:32.000
 which kind of will have a little bit of a schedule as to when we can focus more on certain topics

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:38.000
 but first we have the outer nundra, four thoughts that turn the mind

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:43.000
 and then once we enter the extraordinary nundra

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:56.000
 we have taking refuge, bodhicitta, mandala offering, vajrasattva practice, purification, guru yoga

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:02.000
 and then in addition to that we have this aspiration to Amitabha to accomplish PoA

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:08.000
 as well as the charity of giving everything with our great bodhicitta

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 and so we'll send out a little bit of a schedule as to looking at the Saturdays we'll be doing that

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:20.000
 so people can kind of have some sense of how we're progressing

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:41.000
 so with the practice, practice or meditation means we're becoming familiar

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000
 familiarizing with things as they are

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:52.000
 the Great Kindness Buddha Shakyamuni gave the profound vast ocean of teachings

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:58.000
 that so beautifully through the blessings of the lineage of this lineage of practice and study

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:06.000
 which came to Tibet in the 8th century entails the full package of the Buddhist teachings

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:13.000
 which can be summarized into three vehicles or three yanas that are practiced as a unity

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:27.000
 the whole aim of the Buddhist teachings are to remove our obscurations and the causes of them

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:33.000
 and by that naturally bringing out our innate goodness qualities

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:39.000
 our innate Buddhahood central to the teachings is that the Buddha taught

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:44.000
 every single living being has a Buddha nature

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:57.000
 has that potential for inconceivable, uncompounded, immeasurable love, wisdom, compassion

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000
 qualities we all have but just need to bring out

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:11.000
 and so by seeing, refraining from harm, engaging in benefit

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 working with our own mind is our path and our practice

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 and like we'll get to a little bit later on

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:28.000
 all the results of our experience have their causes

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:38.000
 so in the really big big big picture the cause of our Buddhahood is our Buddha nature

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000
 so that's something definitely to take in our mind and our heart

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.000
 and that's what we're doing with the teachings

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:49.000
 and so we have, we're developing our wisdom

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:54.000
 we have what are called the three wisdoms

00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:02.000
 which are listening, hearing, reading, the teachings

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:10.000
 and then contemplating, thinking, reflecting, taking them to heart with practice

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:16.000
 so study, contemplation, practice

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:26.000
 and similarly when we begin any practice or maybe take a step back

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:35.000
 we have our practice time to kind of bring in that third wisdom

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.000
 with these sessions we're kind of moving a little bit

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.000
 with all of those developing those three wisdoms

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:49.000
 but what little bit I bring up here now obviously isn't the whole vast ocean of the Dharma

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:55.000
 but little sparks and this is really like Rinpoche mentions and it's true

00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 we've all heard so many teachings, we've all done some degree of practice

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.000
 just bringing them up into our own minds and hearts

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.000
 and settling into the practice, working with our own mind

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000
 is what we're really trying to do

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:18.000
 and so when we have a formal practice that we're taking

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:25.000
 there's what are called three frames or three noble ones

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:32.000
 which is essentially saying we want to kind of have the right frame

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:37.000
 the right vessel for our practice to touch home base

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:44.000
 and then everything in the world has a beginning, has a middle and has an end

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:49.000
 and so kind of using that natural truth

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:54.000
 we're working with that with how we structure our practice

00:33:54.000 --> 00:34:04.000
 and everything that's said in the teachings, everything that happens is circumstantial

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:09.000
 our motivation is what makes all the difference

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:14.000
 and so like Rinpoche says at the beginning of every teaching

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000
 like all the great masters say at the beginning of every teaching

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:24.000
 but this is something we should always be doing with every time we sit down to practice

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:32.000
 is engaging with what's called the three motivations

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:38.000
 motivation, intention really makes all the difference

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:43.000
 and so that's the big part of this first frame

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:47.000
 and again they're not like a step we're going to take and leave it behind

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:52.000
 we're setting the foundations and we're growing from there

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.000
 so when we have made a little bit of time for practice

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:01.000
 we want to sit down, we want to reconnect with those

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 and so basically like we've heard many times but again we need to do it

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:13.000
 it's connecting with our joy, our appreciation

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:26.000
 relax, you know, let go and recognize just how precious our situation is

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:34.000
 quietly, calmly, it doesn't have to be like some panic

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:42.000
 excitement but just take a moment to refresh and reflect on how precious our situation is

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:47.000
 and then engaging our bodhicitta

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:52.000
 really thinking through the power of interdependence

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:57.000
 through the power of the truth of the innate goodness

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:05.000
 that really make that aspiration, may this practice, may this study, may this contemplation

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:12.820
 truly be of benefit not just for myself but countless sentient beings in this life, beyond this

00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:13.000
 life

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:21.000
 beyond my perception just truly generating with that vast, as vast a space there are beings

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.000
 as much as there are obscurations, there are sentient beings

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:31.000
 every sentient being has the same beautiful nature

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:38.000
 sorry I'm getting my tech feedback here, I'll try to adjust this so I'm not wrestling at you all

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:08.000
 refreshing with our bodhicitta

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:13.000
 relaxing, contentment, joy, appreciation

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:20.000
 and then expanding our bodhicitta, the vast, limitless sentient beings

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:30.000
 and then connecting with our devotion, with our pure perception

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:39.000
 which can be seen kind of recognizing there's nothing else but this moment

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:46.000
 deep down this moment is pure, this moment is perfect

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.000
 this isn't some coincidental accident

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:55.000
 we are here with our practice in the spirit of love and compassion

00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:02.150
 these amazing teachings have come into our life with living human teachers who embody them so

00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:03.000
 beautifully

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:10.000
 that we have the fortune to meet and to practice together as sangha

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:15.000
 even like over space and time

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.000
 so precious, so beautiful

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:24.430
 so like those five, connecting with that, just the perfection of this moment, this is the perfect

00:38:24.430 --> 00:38:25.000
 time

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.000
 this is the perfect place

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:33.000
 we have the perfect teacher, we have the perfect teaching

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:40.410
 and we're all the perfect, just everything has come into place with the assembly of people in the

00:38:40.410 --> 00:38:44.000
 mandala receiving these teachings

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:58.000
 on the deep level too, this vastness view that deep down everything is pure enlightened mind

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:05.000
 everything we experience is within our mind, of our mind

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:11.000
 our mind is pure, our mind is vast, it's Buddha mind

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:19.000
 all sounds, all thoughts are the speech of the Buddha nature

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:27.000
 all forms, all appearances are the display of the Buddha's bodies

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:31.000
 just connecting with that view at least

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:39.000
 because our view is so important without having a little bit of a vista

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:43.000
 then we're kind of left a little bit in the dark

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:49.000
 so bringing out that inner light, that inner wisdom, feeling that pure view

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:56.000
 the three vadra states, enlightened mind, enlightened body, enlightened speech is our whole

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.000
 experience

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:01.000
 this is the perfect time, this is the perfect place

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:05.000
 its nature is bodhicitta, bringing out bodhicitta

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:15.000
 thinking of everyone who has not recognized that beautiful nature, including ourselves

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:21.000
 and then looking at the suffering we have, the suffering others have

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:27.000
 with an open mind, an open heart, and relaxing with that

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:35.020
 that's the essence of these three motivations, sometimes that's called the motivation of ren

00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:36.000
unciation

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:43.000
 often Rinpoche says kind of joy and appreciation, which is true

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:51.000
 but also it's that aspect of looking at things enough clearly at how things actually are

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:57.310
 that we're not so much going against the grain so we'll talk a little bit about that when we get to

00:40:57.310 --> 00:40:59.000
 the four thoughts

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:05.000
 but more contentment, more joy, more appreciation for our situation

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:11.000
 less obsession with our story, kind of getting out of the way of ourselves and others

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:21.000
 that's the essence of renunciation maybe bodhicitta, pure perception, devotion

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:27.000
 these are the three motivations, and again and again the great teachers say

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:37.000
 our teacher says we're starting with these things at the beginning because that is the nature

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:48.000
 the whole vast ocean of the Buddhist teachings which we have the great fortune to have in our hand

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:54.000
 and we're trying to take into our heart, it's called like I mentioned earlier

00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:04.000
 the three vehicles, the foundational vehicle or Theravadin Buddhism or sometimes called Hinayana

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:15.000
 in relation to the Mahayana and the extension of Mahayana is Vajrayana

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:23.000
 the view and the motivation of all of our practice is practicing these three vehicles together

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:28.000
 all the teachings, all the practices, the view that is established

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:36.000
 the meditation we do that helps to embody and familiarize ourselves and become more natural

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:42.000
 authentic with that view is called meditation which is helped by our conduct

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:50.660
 both on the cushion and off the cushion and that brings us to the result of moving through the

00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:51.000
 paths

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:57.000
 and the bhoomis to full Buddhahood for the benefit of all

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:06.000
 and so the essence of basic foundation of Buddhism is renunciation

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:17.000
 learning to be less selfish, less obsession, more contentment, more appreciation, more joy

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:25.000
 you know not getting so fixed on our snags and lost in our crags

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:32.000
 but kind of really taking in more of the full vista where we can see maybe in the big picture

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:39.000
 we're really quite fortunate anyway I should watch the time here too

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:47.300
 but the essence of foundational Buddhism is renunciation, joy, appreciation, contentment, less

00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:50.000
 obsession, more contentment

00:43:50.000 --> 00:44:03.000
 the essence of Mahayana is bodhicitta which is that subject

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:09.000
 but that's the essence and again even more openness

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:13.000
 the essence of Vajrayana is pure perception

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:23.000
 kind of devotional awe and reference for the innate goodness and natural purity of all phenomena

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:27.000
 and so with that we purify our obscurations

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:34.000
 we go right to the heart of our practice so that's why in the beginning of our practice

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:41.190
 we're beginning with those three simple things connecting with our joy, appreciation, bodhicitta,

00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:44.000
 devotion, pure perception

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:48.000
 and we enter into the practice with that

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:05.000
 so when we do start our practice

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:12.520
 again forgive me I'm really kind of trying to navigate our time so we actually do end up doing some

00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:13.000
 practice

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:17.000
 so I'll try to keep it a little bit short

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:23.000
 but just to again take back if we're thinking about our formal practice

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:29.000
 reserving a little bit of time to do that is good

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:38.000
 ideally that's going to be something we could do day to day

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:47.000
 or however fits with our rhythms and the other obligations and things we need to do in our life

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:52.000
 but really reserving some time for practice is so special

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:55.000
 and it doesn't have to be hours

00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:03.000
 but what makes all the difference over time is a continuum

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:09.000
 so when we start our practice whatever the amount of time

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:18.000
 kind of just like we've done so far arriving, paying attention to our, excuse me, our posture

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:23.000
 I don't think we have time to go over everything so maybe next week in the beginning we can go over

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:24.000
 a little bit of like

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:30.000
 just basic things with our posture, our body, the seven kind of aligning

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:34.000
 there's also many teachings on that

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:38.000
 we did the breath purification, relaxing our mind

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:47.000
 and just like I've just said engaging with our joy, appreciation, bodhicitta, devotion

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:51.000
 opening our mind and our heart and extending that

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:55.000
 and then feeling the presence of the living lineage

00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:01.000
 the blessings of all the Buddhas, the presence of our teacher

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.000
 and then we begin the practice

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:10.000
 and so usually we always begin with the seven line prayer, lineage prayers

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:16.000
 and then of course we're particularly working on the nundra sadhana itself

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:20.000
 and this is particularly the dudrum tursar nundra

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:26.000
 that was revealed and kind of distilled by His Holiness Duddham Rinpoche

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:30.000
 from his previous reincarnations work

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:36.540
 the very concise, very beautiful, it's what most everyone in the mandala Padmasambhava Buddhist

00:47:36.540 --> 00:47:37.000
 Center

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:43.000
 practices as their daily practice and moves through the nundra in their life

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:47.000
 so that's what we're following

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:52.000
 and as we're doing the practice

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:58.000
 I'm kind of going through things once we actually get to the practice according to our time

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:04.000
 so just know that your practice doesn't have to be the same as what we're doing here every day

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:07.000
 as far as the amount of time we spend on things

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:15.000
 or how many times you recite a certain line or whether we say in Tibetan or English or both

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:19.000
 that's kind of a little open so just know that

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:25.000
 so when you do have time starting like I said

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:34.000
 and then like I mentioned we have since we're on this line of the motivation

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:42.000
 and kind of setting the stage this first frame of the good and the beginning

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:45.000
 just like that's the essence of the Buddhist teachings

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:49.000
 everything is good in the beginning so starting right with those qualities

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:53.000
 as we can connect with them right here and now is what we're doing

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:58.000
 and then with the nundra itself

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:09.000
 we have I think it's on page 26, 27 is where the actual nundra practices begin in this

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:21.000
 and there's these this is called the four reflections that reverse the mind

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:25.000
 so this is again in that good and the beginning aspect

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:31.000
 not that we leave it behind but turning our mind towards these things is so effective

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:36.000
 it said if we can really reflect on these things before every practice

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:42.000
 before every teaching throughout the day it really helps and why is that?

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:50.000
 because most of the time we're expecting something different

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:57.000
 we all have the Buddha nature

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:03.000
 but we haven't realized it or we're in the process of recognizing it

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:06.000
 that's the only difference between fully enlightened Buddha

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:09.000
 an ordinary sentient being like myself

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:13.000
 is how much we recognize our nature or not

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:18.000
 that's what Buddha means fully developed, fully awakened

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:23.000
 and completely purified of obscurations and their causes

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:28.000
 we tend to think things are permanent

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:31.000
 they're going to be last forever

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:38.000
 that I am and that is and nothing matters

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:44.000
 except for what I want or think I want right now

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:50.000
 who I think I am or who I think that person is etc. and so on

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:58.540
 we think things are not so much connected that maybe things don't have so much of effect on each

00:50:58.540 --> 00:50:59.000
 other

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:05.000
 things are permanent or individual, independent, going to last forever

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:13.000
 lots of things that we all have this basic ignorance of how things truly are

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:19.000
 and these four thoughts are things that everyone whether you're Buddhist or not

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:24.000
 these are facts of life

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:28.000
 and so kind of reflecting on these we have these really simple lines

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:33.000
 but really spending time reflecting on these like throughout the day

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:37.000
 or like reading about them in words of my perfect teacher

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:42.000
 or from Dojo Rinpoche or Kenpo Sei Wong and Kenchen Paulden Rinpoche

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:46.000
 these are totally traditional teachings

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:53.000
 that means they're tried and true have been effective for everyone for these great masters

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:57.000
 these are things they've taken to their mind in their heart

00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:08.000
 so these four thoughts are as we know basically reflecting on this precious human birth

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:13.000
 reflecting on impermanence

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:18.000
 reflecting on the law of karma

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:24.000
 and reflecting on suffering on samsara

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:31.840
 just really looking at it all those things kind of with an open mind with an open heart kind of

00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:34.000
 clearly

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:40.000
 and so again we really should start our practice soon but as we can we can say more

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:46.000
 and so much already has been said by our wonderful teacher as well as so many other great masters

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:52.000
 so I really encourage you look try to find even if you've read reflect on these things

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:58.000
 really having them in our in our day in the atmosphere of our attitude and mind

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:05.000
 really recognizing and reflecting on all the situations we're free of

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:08.000
 both within this human world that we can perceive

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:14.000
 and then through the omniscience of the Buddha and the truth of his teachings

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:18.000
 the experiences of other beings and other realms

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:22.000
 there's so many situations we're totally free of

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:28.000
 and we have so many good circumstances in our favor

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:35.000
 especially regarding being relieved and released from suffering and its causes

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:43.000
 a Buddha has appeared and the teaching and has taught and the teachings remain

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:49.000
 and we have to some degree some interest in faith in those teachings

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:56.000
 and our putting them into practice is up to us

00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:03.000
 so like reflecting on on all that and how rare actually in the big picture

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:09.980
 being human born human with all these favorable freedoms and endowments and circumstances is

00:54:09.980 --> 00:54:12.000
 amazing

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:22.000
 and impermanence no matter which way we turn we can see how everything's changing

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:33.000
 always our emotions our minds our perceptions the day our lives civilizations everything

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:42.000
 that comes into being moves out of being everything's changing

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:46.000
 look to our own lives you know

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:51.000
 no matter which way we look like the Buddha said of all the footprints of all the animals

00:54:51.000 --> 00:55:03.000
 the elephants is supreme of all the things we could contemplate impermanence is supreme

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:10.000
 is it something we all can really very clearly see and just be familiar with that truth

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:18.000
 and it's not all a bummer either of course right no matter if things couldn't change

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:23.000
 we couldn't become more natural

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:28.000
 and really logically speaking if nothing ever changed

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:37.000
 it's kind of impossible anyway impermanence and like Nipam Rinpoche said

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:42.000
 becoming familiar with impermanence is so really really really special

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:48.000
 and profound to our mind and our consciousness because one seeing things how they are

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:58.000
 but it's also how we begin to understand emptiness

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:05.390
 and then reflecting on karma like it says the results of virtuous or unvirtuous actions are inex

00:56:05.390 --> 00:56:06.000
orable

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:17.000
 that's another just fact of life everything we experience is the ripening of our past thoughts and

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:17.000
 actions

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:23.000
 that's what karma means is action often sometimes I think especially in the West

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:30.000
 people think karma means just what's happening but it's also what we do with what's happening

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:37.000
 and that's what makes all the difference for the future so they say just like in the common

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:42.000
 if we plant an apple seed and give it all the right conditions to grow

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:50.000
 it's going to root and shoot and flower and fruit and there'll be more and more apples

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:56.000
 if some if it gets dry and dries out it won't happen

00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:00.000
 there's so many circumstances that can happen that won't bring it to being

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:05.000
 but when the conditions to bring that seed into fruition happen it will happen

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:12.000
 and it will be not just one seed many seeds and many apples similar with all our experiences

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:21.000
 what we how we perceive what we do with our body with our speech especially with our mind

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:27.000
 and the actions that flow through our speech and our body that makes all the difference

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:35.000
 and the results are inevitable what we do with them is what makes all the difference

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:41.000
 and here we have practice and suffering the three realms of cyclic existence

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:51.000
 have the nature of an ocean of suffering we have these three basic poisons

00:57:51.000 --> 00:58:01.000
 as the Buddha called our ignorance our aversion our attachment and from all from those

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:09.000
 all samsara springs so suffering has its causes and there's so many sufferings beings go through

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:14.000
 both that we can perceive in this world to whatever degree we can and again according to the

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:21.000
 the omniscient true speech of the Buddha who kind of told us of other experiences

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:29.220
 beings go through that are outside of our perception but are just as real to them as this is real

00:58:29.220 --> 00:58:30.000
 to us

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:36.000
 so again we don't have a whole lot of time maybe we can definitely look at these again

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:44.000
 talk a little bit about these but taking these to heart becoming more familiar with

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:58.000
 like they say with suffering samsara is suffering samsara is ignorance of what of how things are

00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:07.680
 and all the actions done out of that basic ignorance and hope and fear that engenders our bodhic

00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:08.000
itta

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:17.000
 and it's also maybe we begin to slowly but surely recognize we're not going to find

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:25.000
 everlasting peace and relief in samsara as much as we have ignorance that much we have samsara

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:33.000
 as much as we have aversion and attachment and ego clinging and grasping that much we have samsara

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:45.000
 whose nature is empty is open is aware and that's why we begin this namo the very first line

00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:58.000
 lama infallible constant protector beware of me calling to the mind the lama the Buddha

00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:04.000
 one who has completely realized that nature is free of obscuration due to their great kindness

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:11.500
 and compassionate activity as bringing this to our own experience that we can explore our own

01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:12.000
 nature

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:22.000
 bring out those innate qualities of our own mind cleanse our Buddha nature to bring it

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:31.230
 give it all the causes and conditions to expand to grow into full bloom state remove our obsc

01:00:31.230 --> 01:00:32.000
urations

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:40.000
 and kenpo samangs also said this first line namo lama infallible constant protector be aware of me

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:46.000
 that's also of course thinking of the outer lama and the great living lineage that's present

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:55.000
 whose blessings and activities and realization is in our life in our mind but also our own

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:55.000
 awareness

01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:04.000
 our own view our own attitude with kind of keeping that in our mind and heart as we reflect on

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:12.000
 these four thoughts which naturally bring out our bodhicitta make us more content bring out more

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:19.000
 bodhicitta kind of give that at least kind of courage that commitment that devotion and closeness

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:30.000
 feeling to just the innate gorgeous beauty of truth and what's natural and authentic so

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:39.000
 which is the three jewels the Buddha Dharma Sangha so maybe with that I'll conclude my little

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.000
 talking

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:55.000
 and we can actually do some practice so yeah I have time so we'll just sit for a moment

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:09.000
 try to remember everything I just babbered about and and everything you know and have in your heart

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:37.000
 and the real dharmas that awaken those beautiful qualities in your practice

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:49.000
 so

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:15.000
 we'll begin with this seven line prayer and quick lineage prayers we'll just say seven line prayer

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:25.000
 once and then our lineage prayers ordinarily we do three times so just for time maybe we'll do one

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:47.790
 time we'll do three times in our mind and our own language so we'll just sit for a moment and then

01:03:47.790 --> 01:03:49.000
 our own

01:03:49.000 --> 01:04:04.000

 devotion and kind of that purity view we'll recite this calling the lama from afar we

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:03.000
 have time today and again as we read these reflecting on the meaning but relaxing with

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:14.000
 that view bringing out everything we've been talking about letting all the teachings and

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:34.000
 practice we have have a landing pad and a doorway through these words so we're on page 18 in
