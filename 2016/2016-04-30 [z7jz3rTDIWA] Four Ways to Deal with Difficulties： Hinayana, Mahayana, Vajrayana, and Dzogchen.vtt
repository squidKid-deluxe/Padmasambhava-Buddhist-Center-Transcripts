00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
 Generally, of course, it is a conduct. It is a conduct, but it is a particularly kind of like

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.000
 highlighting of the emotional conduct, emotional or emotions.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.580
 And those are, as in the teaching, what in the Buddha teaching gives different techniques for these

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.000
 two, avoiding.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:34.250
 And using, or changing, using as path, path, and liberating, those are the four techniques the

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.000
 greatest teacher Buddha presented.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:47.520
 The first one is, avoiding is like in basic Buddhism teachings, such as Vinaya teachings, trying to

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.000
 always avoiding those emotional activities, so trying to be distant.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 Distant from that, trying to distant ourselves from those emotional states.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 So, emotion is not good. In particular, we are talking about bad emotions.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.630
 Emotional is like poison, and the poison is not good, and therefore, I like to be distant, and I am

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.000
 going to avoid that as much as I can.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 And that approach is the teaching in basic Buddhist teaching or Vinaya teachings.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.550
 Second teaching is changing that, or using that, changing that status. And that is, again, same

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.000
 thing in the poison.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:40.930
 You see, poison is not good. Good is not good. But if you have the skill and the technique, oh, it

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:46.000
 can change it, change it as medicines.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 Or it can be, do something that, and it can be useful. It's not something that I have to avoid,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 distant that completely reject that I have, I can use.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:06.030
 And that is in Mahayana approach, and what the Buddha's teaching, Buddha said, in one, in the Soth

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.000
ar teaching said, he used examples.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 For example, the cities, cities, the, what's called, human manual, what's called human manual?

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:50.060
 Human manual, human manual, or the cities, like this, separate, cities, separate, sewer, that's

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.000
 what I have.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 Sewers, cities, sewer can be very beneficial for growth of the sugar cane. That's what I said.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 Cities, similarly, these emotions can be very beneficial to growth of the body together.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:20.550
 So you use them, you're not using that sewer as readily as it is, but you still reject that and

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:30.000
 attract that sewer, sewer used growth of the sugar cane or the harvest, or used as manual.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:39.750
 So that is the Mahayana approach. And then, when the Mahayana approach, again, the same thing, same

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.000
 as that boson, which is not really good.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 Good is a boson, but you don't have to be rejected, you don't have to change it.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 You use that very boson to bring your own splendor, good call it, good call it.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:08.670
 And that used examples in the Buddha teaching, piko. Piko can eat the boson, boson instead reject

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:16.250
 it, it will help to the piko to bring the glories of the brightness of their feathers or whatever

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.000
 that is, it's that.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.850
 And so they have the capability to use in the Mahayana teaching, always that we don't have to give

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:34.000
 up all the samsara pleasures, and use that as same that we use brain realization to understand that

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.000
.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:42.030
 That with the mindfulness of the Mahayana teachings or the instructions of the Mahayana teaching,

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.000
 it will bring growth and the development of the relaxation.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.760
 And then the Dzogji teaching is also, of course, for the beginning. Generally, it's all already

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.000
 display of the raka, so it's nothing really wrong.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.080
 But however, for the beginning of practice in Dzogji, also we are not letting carry with that

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:09.780
 emotions, and immediately not going to reject, not going to change trying to do something, or use

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.000
 as that boson as a kind of separate entity.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:23.710
 But that very boson looks at that nature of the boson, and the boson is empty, the boson is the

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.000
 wisdom.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:33.550
 So without doing all those activities, looking immediately to that nature of the emotions, and that

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:39.000
 moment, you liberate it, you liberate it or transcend it into the wisdom.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 And what all this does, it is all the same, it doesn't really hurt for the practitioners.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 Whether you're avoiding, whether you're changing, whether you're using, whether you're liberating,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 it's not hurting, but it's helping to grow and maintain and bring realization of our realization.
