00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.260
 Warm greeting, friends. Warm greetings. Hello. Good to see you all again. Again, we'll just

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:19.940
 take a moment, like usual, to reconnect with our motivation. So the reason we're here reflecting

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:26.120
 on Dharma and trying to take this moment to pause and connect is really essentially trying

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:32.700
 to reactivate our own goodness, our own strength and courage and clarity of vision, and also

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.860
 with the goodness in other people. So that's Bodhichitta. Just try to shine that on right

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.740
 now. We'll do that for a moment. And then also kind of reconnect with that kind of strong,

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:49.780
 that certainty that everyone has this goodness and that things are fundamentally workable

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:56.540
 and opportunities kind of in our favor to shine this beauty we have out more. So we'll just

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:25.860
 do that for a moment. So I was talking with one of my awesome nephews yesterday. And we

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:36.400
 came to the definitive conclusion that in all of existence, the entire universe, there are

00:01:36.400 --> 00:02:00.940
 only two things. Squirrels and not squirrels. This true? Okay, so it could sound odd, so

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:19.220
 I'll repeat it again. The only things in the whole universe, squirrels and not squirrels.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:28.920
 Sounds funny. So maybe unless you're a squirrel, then it might sound very true. So okay, let's

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:41.280
 cut it up in one different way. Clocks and not clocks. Is that true? The only things

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:58.880
 that exist. It's true. Right? But is it helpful? So the Buddha was not saying just what's

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:06.520
 true, but what's helpful? Because it sounds funny. Squirrels and not squirrels, right?

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:14.840
 Like that's so ridiculous. Who would think of that? But don't we do that? Pleasure and

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:31.800
 pain. Good and bad. Americans, non-Americans, Buddhists, non-Buddhists. Don't we do this?

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:51.200
 And is it helpful? Right? So the big bedrock time, one thing we all can agree on, regardless

00:03:51.200 --> 00:04:03.480
 of squirrels or clocks or Americans or Buddhists, we all believe there's me and not me. No matter

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:10.360
 where we're from, what language we speak, what time we live in, we really deep in our

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:21.280
 very core. I definitely do. There's me and there's everything else. And that's how I

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:34.440
 navigate every single moment of my life. And the Buddha asked us, is this helpful? Because

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:45.920
 it is true. But does it have all the truth? We can cut up a pie of reality in the universe

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:54.240
 in any varieties of ways. So say we want to get more sophisticated and say it's not me

00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:01.360
 and not not me. We can just break it down a little bit. It's me, not me, not both me

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:09.480
 and not me, not neither me and not me. Right? Did the Buddha did that? Didn't the Buddha

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:15.200
 have all kinds of boxes like this? Four noble truths. Isn't that a complete description

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:23.480
 of reality? Suffering its cause, cessation of suffering in its cause. The three turnings

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:31.660
 of the wheel of Dharma. The five aggregates and five elements. The five dhyana buddhas.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:40.680
 The three yanas. The one yana. These are all true boxes. They are all true things we could

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:46.840
 believe in. And then the question is, is it helpful? And then the question becomes, is

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:58.440
 it helpful for me right now? Because we're all going to assume the me, not me. That we

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:07.440
 all share as sentient beings. As ridiculous as that is. And as functional as that is,

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:14.440
 if I'm hungry, I feed food to myself. I don't throw it on the ground. It's very functional

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:23.440
 to believe in me and not me. Poisonous and not poisonous. Healthy and unhealthy. These

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:32.560
 are really important distinctions to make, but how helpful are they? And so the question

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:42.040
 is not what box is right, but what box is helpful for me right now? And as we start

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:46.880
 to look at that a little more and a little more, we kind of start to see that everyone

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:53.680
 has this way of experiencing reality. There's me and not me. And so another way to say that

00:06:53.680 --> 00:07:02.560
 is me and the world. And the real practical thing to kind of swallow and really see as

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:07.720
 a fundamental result of that way of framing experience is who is going to win the arm

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:25.120
 wrestling match of me versus the world. I will always lose. How could I win that game? How

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:38.120
 could anyone? It is a win-lose game. So one of the challenges the Buddha was saying is

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:46.240
 one, look to ourselves, how are we cutting up reality? And is it helpful? And two, are

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:52.360
 there other ways to step into reality, into boxes, to make distinctions, to understand

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:58.280
 what's good and wrong right, you know, bad, good, helpful, unhelpful? Are there other

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:04.940
 ways to do it that could actually include more of experience, more of the diversity

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:11.800
 and the richness of life? And he asked us to look at that for ourselves. Because any

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:22.760
 time we make a division and we say mine and not mine, in, out, then everything that's

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:31.020
 on the outside, there's two ways of experiencing that. We build the wall, right? Outside is

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:42.380
 either a threat or it's an opportunity. Is it a threat where we need to defend against

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:49.360
 that at all costs because it's the bad guy or it's the enemy, it's the unknown? Or is

00:08:49.360 --> 00:09:02.080
 it an opportunity? It's the unknown. Wow, what's that like? How's that work? Is it a

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:12.760
 threat or an opportunity? Because if we think everything outside of our box, whatever our

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:21.120
 box is, it could be all men, all Buddhists, all sentient beings. There's a box and there's

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:25.400
 different sizes and different textures and different varieties and different things that

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:30.600
 they include and not. But any time we hold a box, we hold a system, we hold a frame,

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:36.420
 we hold a context, we hold a container, there's something we leave out. And that thing we

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:43.280
 leave out, is it scary and so we should defend against it or is it interesting and so we

00:09:43.280 --> 00:10:01.000
 should check it out a little more? And the Buddha said do both, right? The fundamental

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.120
 takeaway of this, because everything is kind of distilled into these essential gems that

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:10.440
 we're trying to like distill the essence of everything because we're so flooded with

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:17.040
 information now, the fundamental takeaway of kind of what I'm throwing out there to

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:27.960
 consider right now is a bedrock kind of question for our nundro practice is are we going to

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:45.080
 choose how to experience our life? Are we going to let something else choose it for us? Because

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:52.100
 if we don't take on when we have to frame experience, this is nundro time, then I stand

00:10:52.100 --> 00:11:00.100
 up and do my non-session time. That is a frame, it is a box. Meditation and post meditation

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:09.280
 is a box. But does that box help me or not? Do I intentionally take on that box? I own

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:16.840
 that, that frame, that distinction, that division. Do I really joyfully engage it? These are

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:23.560
 my limits. This is what I'm working with. This is the game I'm playing right now. Soccer,

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:35.480
 nundro, being a parent, eating dinner. These are all frames. When I'm in that frame, whatever

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:42.200
 that frame is, because we're always framing our experience with a view. Does that frame

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:49.740
 make me curious and open to more experience? Not just what's outside of the box, but what's

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:57.760
 in the box? What does this taste like? What's my kid? What are they saying right now? Buddhism,

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:02.480
 what's this? I've never looked at this part of Buddhism. Oh, non-Buddhism, what's that

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:06.680
 other view? What do they say? How do they make sense of that? Do they think an enlightenment

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:12.920
 exists? Is it true or not? Well, how does it work for them? We can either really intentionally

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:21.400
 consciously engage how we frame our experience, we can choose it for ourselves, or we can

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:32.160
 have it forced on us. The thing is, when we're little babies, and we're kids, and we're adults,

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:39.600
 almost everything we experience, we don't get to choose, because we don't get to choose

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:46.600
 who walks in the room and what they say. If we go to a restaurant, we don't get to choose

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:51.760
 how the food tastes if we didn't cook it. We don't get to choose what the weather's going

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:55.680
 to be like today. We don't get to choose the memory that's going to randomly pop into my

00:12:55.680 --> 00:13:04.280
 mind right now. We can choose, how are we going to frame it? How are we going to engage it?

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:11.760
 With curiosity or with fear? It's the unknown. They're both unknown. I can cook the meal

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:17.680
 or not cook the meal, and I really don't know how it's going to turn out until I taste it.

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:24.560
 They're both unknown. But is it going to be an interesting, curious, heart-opening unknown?

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:34.160
 Or is it going to be a contracting, shut down, tense, locked up, unknown? Is Nundro going

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:40.840
 to be experienced as this giant burden that we have to plow through because that's what

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:51.240
 a good Buddhist does? Right? There's times like that. Or is Nundro going to be experienced

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:57.200
 as an adventure? Like, what is my mind doing right now? Like, I'm totally freaking out

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:02.800
 doing these prostrations. I'm totally freaking out doing this mandala thing. Oh, I love this

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:08.040
 Vajrasattva practice. Please, I want to do more of this. Oh, I hate this Vajra practice.

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:14.240
 I can't even do another one because our mind's going to do all of this stuff because it's

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:21.040
 energetic and we can't stop it. And why would we want to? It would be the end. No more

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:34.720
 mind. No more me. Game over. And for some people, that would be a relief. No more suffering.

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:43.480
 Game over. You know, there's a self. It's a problem. Why don't I just blow it up? Right?

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:50.840
 A lot of us try that. There's another. It's a problem. Why don't I just blow it up? Or

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:59.320
 avoid it. Or romanticize it. Or obsess about it. Or make this giant wall where it's held

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:05.020
 in this very specific, suffocated, saran-wrapped way that it can't dynamically live and breathe

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:12.920
 as an actual living thing. My practice. My mind. Myself. Because the thing is, is we're

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:18.720
 making all these boundaries and divisions all the time. Me as a good person, me as a

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:22.960
 bad person, me as a good practitioner, as a bad practitioner, as a brother, a son, a

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:34.000
 daughter, a Buddhist, a non-Buddhist, a dancer, a writer. Is it helpful or not? Are we going

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:42.200
 to use these divisions we make to foster more curiosity and include more of experience?

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:53.760
 Are we going to choose to use frames, views, systems that cause us to open up and get really

00:15:53.760 --> 00:16:00.440
 fresh and engaged? Or are we going to just experience life as this thing we have to slug

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:08.240
 through because it's brief, brutal, and short, and nasty, and like, please just let me get

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:17.040
 through it and finally I can retire and then I can really do what I want. Finally I'll

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:24.320
 get my nundra done, then I can do what I really want. Right? I only say this because I have

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:30.140
 these things happen in my mind. I've done enough practice in a very short time to see

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:34.640
 that my mind jumps around all the time and it can make something into a devil and it

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:50.020
 can make something into a god and I deify and I demonize all the time. Do you do that?

00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:58.680
 Because if something is a demon, all bad, or a god, all good, and there's anything outside

00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:08.080
 of that, we lose that game. Because there's always going to be another, there's always

00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:15.480
 going to be an unknown that's not included and that is going to be unpredictable, uncertain,

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:22.000
 uncontrollable and when it comes down to it, how are we going to react to the new thing

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:29.720
 as a threat or as an opportunity? And that's what the beauty of being a human being is,

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:34.400
 a sentient mind that actually has dynamic movement and is actually alive, a sentient

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:43.360
 mind. We get stuck in these frames, these habits, these patterns, don't we? And like

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:55.480
 Trump said, which is so powerful and impactful for me, it's like I'm going to paraphrase.

00:17:55.480 --> 00:18:08.200
 Unless you've really experienced heartbreak, your warriorship is untrustworthy. Unless we've

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:13.800
 held on to something that we love, a frame of view, a person and experience, a sense

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:24.740
 of self that we have cherished and cared for and after time, it broke. It changed. It left.

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:35.360
 We lost it. Unless we experience heartbreak, the dissolving of that boundary, our warriorship,

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:41.880
 our confidence, our courage, our bodhisattva motivation to really care for all beings genuinely

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:53.960
 is untrustworthy. It's just talk. So when the boundaries we hold on to, some of them

00:18:53.960 --> 00:19:03.180
 are so loving and so important and so fundamentally good and valuable, like practicing the dharma.

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:08.580
 If we get into a mood or a time, a phase, it could be minutes, it could be years where

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:17.720
 it gets dry and stale and brittle and doesn't have vitality. It could be a session. It could

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:25.640
 be longer. When our boundary gets hazy and all of a sudden we can't relate to it in the

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:35.920
 same way, what do we do? Because that hazy, limbo, vulnerable, wounded, open, unknown,

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:50.760
 bardo flex time, that is the right, rich time to open, to include more, to freshly live

00:19:50.760 --> 00:20:03.240
 in the gap of unprescribed, unscripted, unknown, now. Because we can't control it. And all

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:12.600
 of a sudden our map, we lost our map. Because it broke. It was lost. That's the open time

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:21.000
 for a practitioner to really have their heart come on, have their vision clarified, to have

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:30.800
 their life light up. And so that's a path. Prepare, prepare, prepare, prepare, map, map,

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:38.760
 map, map, map, map, map. Study, study, study. And what do we do after we study? Always we

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:51.260
 poise, we release, we let go. Study and hone, samadhi, concentration, framing, then relax

00:20:51.260 --> 00:21:02.440
 and open and have insight and let vipashana happen. And patiently do it again and again

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:12.480
 and again and again. Hold, release. Hold, release. So the question is, the thing we're holding

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:17.920
 on to, the system, the thing we're concentrating on, the thing we're studying, are we doing

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:25.880
 it with curiosity and entering in the unknown so that it's more enlivening, more courageous,

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:34.500
 more caring, more authentic, more vulnerable, more me, more me as I really am, Buddha nature.

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:45.800
 We hold that. And then we open and relax and release and let it do what it does. And our

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:52.460
 frame opens and it gets bigger. And we include more people and more beings, more genuinely.

00:21:52.460 --> 00:22:01.500
 And we also love and include what we held inside more thoroughly. We love ourselves

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:09.800
 more thoroughly. We love our system more thoroughly. We study Buddhism more thoroughly. We study

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:15.800
 non-Buddhism more thoroughly, right? Because the whole thing isn't just to break through

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:23.680
 all the frames and not ever really care for any of it. It's to really embody and inhabit

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:34.280
 where we're at and how we frame and keep opening and keep opening. That's the Dharma path. And

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:38.440
 there's a million ways that we're going to freeze those frames. And there's a million

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:43.960
 ways that we're going to get hurt and not be ready to deal with that hurt. And so we

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:49.180
 need to stay in our system, stay in our body, stay in our experience, stay in our study,

00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:58.780
 and really nourish that system so that we can grow into that open, aha, teachable moment

00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:05.840
 where a Vajramaster or a teacher can just tap that armor we always hold, that frame

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:14.320
 that we love and that tap, tap, tap. And then there's the weakness in the armor. And instead

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:23.400
 of contracting and freezing and gripping with deathly fear and terror, we open and relax

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:35.480
 into the break and let that vulnerability fully allow our Buddha nature to come through.

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:49.740
 So I think that's the path. It can be summed up as squirrels and not squirrels. But is

00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:57.920
 it helpful to do it that way? Buddhist and not Buddhist? Beginning and not beginning?

00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:02.880
 Enlightenment and not enlightenment? We need to make these divisions, but we need to really

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:10.880
 be aware of when we do them, it's just a temporary working model. The only purpose it has is

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:20.440
 to undo itself to make a better temporary working model so that again, we can relax

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:29.360
 and open and let the dissolution, the dissolving, the flex flow, kind of more wiggly, unknown

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:50.160
 opportunity, live with like really much more vibrant, dynamic energy of our own awareness.

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:58.660
 So when a teacher does that, it's called provocation. Ding, ding, ding. Tap, tap, tap on the frames

00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:09.660
 we love and cherish. And all of a sudden, there's a, huh? Wait, what? Can we open and

00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:18.760
 relax or wall off? And then even more deeply, the question, when someone we don't know shows

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:27.280
 up, ting, ting, ting. And all of a sudden, there's something we can't control. Do we

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:36.840
 open and relax or do we tense up and fight? Is the unknown going to be an endless war

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:49.100
 or an endless opportunity? And I really think the Dharma Path is offering a provocative

00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:58.220
 question for us to see how we're holding experience and really own it and see, is this how I want

00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:05.360
 to hold myself, my sense of me? And when that doesn't stick based on new information, new

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:13.200
 experience, am I going to let myself open and be even more beautiful, more dynamic and

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:26.860
 more curious? Or am I going to shut down and tense up? That's it? I say that as like let

00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:39.160
 your nundro opportunity only become the launch pad for the next very unexpected unknown window

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:47.060
 of the next session. It's just going to keep provoking us. And hopefully we lean into that

00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:53.720
 as being a lojong mind training opportunity of relaxing further and learning more and

00:26:53.720 --> 00:27:00.200
 loving ourselves and others just more genuinely, like more real from our own side and not just

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:06.680
 be a victim of this big experience that we can't control, but be like, I am a wounded

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:16.120
 being. I have all these limitations and that's why I'm awesome because all those little wounds

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:23.660
 and vulnerabilities, that's where my Buddha nature can open through and become even more

00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:29.720
 connected to other beings and more caring for their experience, the way they frame it,

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:34.240
 the way they know it and they love it and they're scared of it. And all of a sudden

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:37.720
 it's about me serving them and caring for them and listening to them and I show up to

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:47.680
 them and my other awesome nephew, I asked him, oh, if you're in the lunchroom and there's

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:53.440
 no one to sit with and you see a new person you've never seen before and you take the

00:27:53.440 --> 00:28:06.080
 brave move and you go up to them and if you can ask them one question, what's the question?

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:16.440
 What's one of your favorite things? Because all of a sudden you're in their system and

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:22.320
 they're just like in love with it and then you get to listen and get in love with it

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:28.360
 too and all of a sudden it's you and them and it's not a fight, it's a partnership,

00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:36.880
 it's a friendship and the world becomes such a more beautiful, lovely place. Thank you.

00:28:36.880 --> 00:29:06.160
 Thank you. Thank you very much.
