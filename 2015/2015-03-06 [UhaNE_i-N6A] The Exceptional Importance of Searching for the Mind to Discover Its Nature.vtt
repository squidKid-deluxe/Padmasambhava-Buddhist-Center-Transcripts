00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.160
 A principle that again deters on these things. First, again, this is what we have to see which is

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.600
 from source.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:17.800
 We think we have three things. That is like boarding the speech mind. That is what we have.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:24.610
 But among that, what is more important? Those are the terminology they use, demolishing the house

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:25.800
 of the mind.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:38.160
 That means what? We are not going to let mind hide behind any house, house of the body, house of

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.600
 the speech.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:50.960
 We are not going to let mind hide. We are going to see exactly what it is, what the mind is, what

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.600
 the speech is, what the body is.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:03.800
 And who is playing roles here? What is doing? What is going on? We are looking thoroughly.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:11.970
 This is what is called in the Buddha's teaching, analyzing. Even our style of meditation, the Dzogc

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:21.400
hen style, meditation is known as a quick meditation.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.200
 Those great masters, ancient Dzogchen, called "analyzation meditation".

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.800
 And then our style is like quicker, instantly to the meditation.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:38.360
 But even that instant to the meditation, there is some analyzation because we have to know what it

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:38.800
 is.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:47.170
 As the great master has always said, "Who is the knowledge and wisdom that knowledge has to have no

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.200
 doubt?"

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:55.200
 Knowledge has to be clear, pristine, so that we don't have to be doubt and hesitant, lingering

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.000
 during the meditating practices.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:07.470
 And we just go peacefully to the practice itself. Therefore, this short, brief analyzation is

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:13.000
 important, and that brings us to the point.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.100
 So, therefore, then we went through three days ago, followed again the instructions of the native

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:29.800
 masters, and added here to how to activate this, how to bring the clearly, clearly understand this.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:36.800
 And so, those are we did. But today, again, I go a little more, again to precisely this.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:47.600
 So now, we see, we heard that always, perception is mind. Perception is mind.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.600
 All the perception is mind. That's what we heard.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.600
 So now, what really that means, the perception is mind?

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.600
 We're trying to close up what the perception is.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:07.400
 Now, we think what the perception is. Is perception the subject, or perception the object?

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:13.400
 We're going to think. Is perception the subject, or perception the object?

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:19.400
 Now, obviously, I think we're going to think perception is the subject.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:26.400
 It's the subject. So that means, and again, perception means mind.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.400
 Now, again, as I said, we close up to this. This.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.400
 What kind of perception is there?

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.780
 There is, according to the Buddha's teaching, I mean, not just according to the Buddha, so precise,

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:47.400
 so clear, accurate, go to the direct as to it is, as it is in a phenomenal world.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:55.280
 Ordering on an absolute level, Buddha goes, and asks precisely, and Buddha says, there is six

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.400
 perceptions.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:03.400
 Six perceptions. There's nothing higher, and there's no lower, less. There's six perceptions.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:13.400
 These six perceptions are, first we go to the five. Those are five senses.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:21.400
 Pipe senses. The eye consciousness, if I use that terminology, or senses, either way.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:32.660
 The eye consciousness, air consciousness, nose consciousness, tongue consciousness, and the body

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.400
 consciousness.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:43.720
 Those are known as pipe senses, that because they connect to the pipe organs, pipe organs, these

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:49.400
 senses of consciousness, intelligence, are sparking toward the organs.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:57.400
 Eye organ, air organ, nose organ, tongue organ, body organs.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:05.400
 With all the organs, these senses cannot spark, cannot spark, cannot spark.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:13.400
 That means, if there is no eye organs, we are blind. We can see the form.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:20.400
 Our form has become completely counter-lost, that idea is.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:30.600
 We can touch, but we can not. In the same way, the ear, if there is no ear organs, the song is

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:37.400
 again demolished, or demolished to the very small, fundamental status.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:44.400
 In the same way, tongue, nose, body, and everything.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.400
 Now, you think, also, of course, this time we analyze, is it true or not?

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:55.400
 We can think those times. That's what the teaching itself, because we are trying to really bring,

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.400
 that is really, perception is mine.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:05.400
 That's what we call it. It is this. So, think, it is mine or not.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:12.400
 All that is this. Now, we can see, again, trying to close up this.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.400
 Close up, close up, go to the border.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:29.200
 Now, when we see things by the eyes, eye perception, what kind of day, what variety of the way eye

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.400
 can see.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:38.660
 These days, so many things, see, but if we summarize where the mental is, kind of like registering

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.400
 to us, principle, highlight that.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:51.610
 It's good, it's bad, or it's just regal, or it is beautiful looking, or it is not good looking, or

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:55.400
 it is just neutral, or just, okay.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:05.400
 These three are the principles, the perceptions of the eye.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:13.790
 That, again, we think now. Now, we see, when we think this is good, this is not good, this is

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:17.400
 neutral, when you see the forms, what is that?

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:24.400
 Is this mind, or this is object? That, that is what we have to think.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:31.630
 Is this mind, or this really object, or the poem is telling, I'm beautiful, or poem is telling, I'm

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:36.400
 not so good, I'm not good, I'm neutral.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:48.480
 Is this, who is it, who has decided that? Who has decided that? And now, again, then, it's nothing

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:51.400
's mind, there is nothing else.

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:59.660
 And similarly, to the eye, regal. Now, again, there is so many songs, so many varieties, those in

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:02.400
 the Buddha teaching, say this song that is natural sound,

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:08.950
 the song that is connected, the song that is connected between two of those, those in this and that

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:09.400
 thing.

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:20.400
 But we again summarize, again highlight that, yes, again, that three. Good, bad, and then neutral.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:31.400
 And the same way, again, song does not come and say, I'm good, I'm bad, I'm neutral, it's me.

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:38.400
 I'm bad, now I'm an addict. Even that song is not good, even those forms are not good.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:44.980
 A mind says, yes, it's good, that doesn't match good. Even maybe the majority in proper world say,

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:50.400
 oh, it's not good, but that individual say, it's good.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:09:00.400
 That is because the mind, but again, it's not the object where the mind is connected.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:07.400
 So this is again, now mind, and then go with this, go with the nose, same thing.

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:12.400
 Delicious smell, un-delicious smell, and neutral.

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:18.400
 And delicious taste, delicious, un-delicious, and neutral.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:24.400
 And soft, rough, and then neutral, filling with the body.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:32.400
 Every day we go one after another. Another, the object is not say, I'm good.

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:37.400
 Form is not say, I'm this and that. Song is not say, I'm this and that.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:43.400
 Smell is not say, I'm this and that. And taste is not say, I'm this and that.

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:48.400
 And touch is not say, this and that. It's our mind.

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:57.400
 And therefore, now we see perception is mind. Now that is what is called perception is mind.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:04.400
 Then we go to the sixth mind. Sixth mind, sixth mind is imagination.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:12.990
 Imagination of, imagination that could be past memory, future plans, all present and happening

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:15.400
 things, we analyze.

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:20.400
 Back and forth, back and forth. That is then definitely the mind.

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:24.400
 It's all happening in the mind, all happening in the brain.

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:29.400
 Brain or mind, all that is happening.

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:33.400
 And why this is so important? Yeah, the perception is so important.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.400
 Because this perception is so important.

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:44.280
 Because every activity, the world phenomena system is operated according to the reactions of the

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:45.400
 perceptions.

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:54.020
 All good things, all bad things, all the violence things, un-violence things and arable, hiding,

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:55.400
 this and that things.

00:10:55.400 --> 00:11:04.400
 All because, best on this. Really start with all this, this is so, so important, so crucial.

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:09.400
 Because of that consequence, all happen, happen, one after another.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:13.400
 Everything is good, good things is positive again.

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:17.400
 Then it's caused by the Nirvana or the enlightenment.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:21.400
 Everywhere it is negative and caused by the samsaras.

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:30.910
 So basically, samsara engine or the Nirvana engine is start, this perception is the engine of this

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:33.400
 both samsara and Nirvana.

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:51.400
 This you think, again, everything is really right or not. True or not.
