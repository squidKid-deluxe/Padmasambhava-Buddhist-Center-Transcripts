00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 The first is visualization and the next is the creation stage practices of the visualization.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:17.320
 In the debate, it is called Chiram. Chiram means something that you realize or you mentally

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.000
 construct.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 You are now going to mentally construct. You are going to try something mentally construct.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 Chiram is a mental construct. Now maybe we are thinking why we are making mentally constructors.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 Why we are making mentally constructors? That is in the teaching series or the very end of the

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 teaching series.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.970
 We are using this mentally construct technique to avoid the larger disturbance of the mental

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.000
 constructors.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 This is, in the teaching often said, to remedy or to cure the disease using the same techniques.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:11.070
 In the teaching said, when you water wet in the egg, to pull out, you put a little water in the

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.000
 teaching set.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:21.380
 So must be that. I never did it. But must be true. So if you like to pull the water out, you pull

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.000
 the water out.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 And to cut the iron, you use the iron. You are going to use iron.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 To cure the pile, troubles, use piles. Those are the teaching set.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 See, same remedy as like, in a way, a modern time, terminology in Western homopathic systems.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 Using homopathic, natural remedies. You are using that.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 This natural remedy is not just also only that, but what it is making.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 Generally, this duality, as you say so many times, we know it, but intellectually we know this.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 Duality is so regimented, so regimented, so kind of like hard, hard-hacks.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 But otherwise, this is the illusion. This universe is illusion.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 Samsara is illusion. Not just the object is illusion. Ourself is illusion.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 So Samsara is a dream. Myself is a dream. Yourself is a dream. Nothing is a difference.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 But we don't see that. Why? Because of our duality. Even we think, "Oh, it's a dream, everything."

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 We always think, "We are the watchers. We are not really dreamers."

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 "Oh, we are watchers of the magic, but I am not magic." That's how duality it is.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 It's always like fold up, clinging, and make the contradicting from where the natures are.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 Otherwise, it's illusion. Now you're going to break the illusion image of the deity,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 exactly as it is, transcendent the illusion of the habit pattern.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.310
 And for that reason, one of the principle purposes of the visualization is always in the teaching

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.000
 set.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:26.040
 The purpose and powerful purpose of the visualization is only to immediately break the system of

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.000
 the duality.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 Immediately you break the system of the dualities.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 You're completely kind of, in a way, giving the electric shock to the duality system.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.070
 What that means, the duality system, you get that. What it does, it breaks the habit pattern

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:45.000
 systems.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 The habit pattern is tumbling now. It's tumbling. The system is tumbling.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 And at the same time, you make it close to the connection, where things are.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 Where things are? Where things are in the beauty of the natural states.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 The natural state is known as three radial states.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 The radial body, the radial speech, and the radial mind. That is the reality.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 This radial body, radial speech, radial mind is not only kind of myself alone, a secluded area.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 Again, if you are relaxed with me, maybe I am that status, that.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 This is something glad you are teaching.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 Buddha is teaching. The entire universe, the world, beyond, is in that three radial states.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 That is what it is.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 All the poems are the radial poems. All the songs are the radial songs.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 And all the space, the mind, are the radial mind.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 Why using the mind? But, sorry, why using the radial?

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 But, wait, radial means there's seven qualities of the radial.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 Often, the great master of thinking also says, again, all this he said, seven qualities.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 But, to summarize that radial poem, it's indestructible.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 That's what Buddha teaching said.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 Why indestructible poem? Why is indestructible song?

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 Why indestructible space or mind?

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 Because the nature of all this is in great emptiness states.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 Every these illusions, in emptiness states, every part of the atoms, atoms in emptiness states,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 and partless atom is emptiness states.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:51.290
 Whether it's gross, whether it's large, all that openness states, freedom states, the illusion

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:52.000
 states,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 that's never going to change. It's never going to change.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 Any means. It's never changing the past. It's not going to change in the future.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 It's not changing every time.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 This is what the way the natural is. Therefore, use the magic.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 It's a display. Display of the natural.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 Display. It's playful natural. It's useful for our Buddha natural.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 Display. Therefore, the Buddha natural, luxury of the sambhoka is richness status.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:33.700
 There's no shortages. Sambhoka. All this is, there is more emanating, more transforming, more

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:39.000
 manifesting, more moving,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 and more transcendent. It's just the waves, endless.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 All different shapes in palm, all that variety comes. That is what the natural is.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 So by this vigillization, you're connected to immediately that natural status.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 Today, vigillization is a window of to bring that whole song of the richness qualities of that.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.580
 And then also in the teachings said, in another reason, immediately it's purifying the habit of

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:10.000
 patterns,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 as it's knocking down. Habit pattern is what?

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 Vigils of the habit pattern is suffering.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 Vigils of the, all the usage of the habit pattern is suffering.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000
 That's what the Buddha taught, the suffering truth, suffering truth.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 This, the physical body, in a normal way, it brings uncomfortables.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 It's a result of the karma.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:43.250
 But immediately, you're now knocking that karmic physical body, physical body into the purity

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:45.000
 divine body

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 of the five dhyana buddhas, five femal buddhas and so on.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 So there, for all those reasons, vigillization is so powerful.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:02.000
 It is connected to the true way things are, and it is immediately, you are in that status.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 Nature is that, and now you're cooperating where the natures are without duality interference.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 So therefore, this, therefore, this vigillization is all so special and important.
