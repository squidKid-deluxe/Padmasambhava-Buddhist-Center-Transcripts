00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.420
 "I talked a little bit about, again, the meaning of the empowerment. Many of you already know that.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:22.000
 But, again, empowerment is one of the very special techniques of the Vedayana Buddhism."

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:32.710
 And the Vedayana Buddhism, as said, the Vedayana teaching has so many methods, so many skills, that

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:46.110
 instantly connecting and upholding the result of the enlightenment or result that what we are

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.000
 looking for, instantly we are connected to that nature.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.250
 Therefore, Vedayana teaching is known as, as he said before, as you all know, the result yarns.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:08.630
 Because we are not waiting for a long time, graduation, instantly we are connecting and jumping, in

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.000
 a way, to the result.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:19.770
 And the result is what? Enlightenment. When you reach the enlightenment, what is? Then everything

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.000
 is enlightenment status.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:35.120
 That means in Vedayana terminology, use three Vedya status. These three Vedya status, poem, song,

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:41.000
 and space, all are enlightenment status.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:54.940
 And this empowerment, connecting, ushering, and introducing this, the poem, song, space, are

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.000
 enlightened.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:10.940
 That means out of form, out of song, out of spaces, as well as our own form, our own song, our own

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.000
 mind is enlightened status.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:29.900
 That introducing, instantly by the blessings of the Buddha and lineage, our meditation, and our

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:38.600
 power of the reciting the mantra, and through the ritual implementer or the objects, we are

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.000
 instantly within that status.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:54.440
 Instantly. And that is known as then, the empowerment. And to discover in one way, discovering our

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:05.000
 basic nature of our in, or discovering our great mysteries of the nature of the in.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:14.620
 And that is known as the empowerment, in one way. And the involvement terminologies, then, I think,

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.000
 whenever you heard, you heard.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:38.260
 Is Abhi Shekha or Abhi Kenza? Kenza. Abhi, again, is Sanskrit word. In the debate, it's called Toru

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:45.000
 Lok, one. And Toru, and Lok, and if we translate like this, pouring and dispelling.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:57.550
 Pouring, I think, right? Pouring and dispelling. Dispelling. What is pouring? Pouring the lineage

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.000
 blessings, the blessings of the Buddha.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:12.930
 Life lineage blessings. Living lineage blessings. That is poured, and that is transmitted by our

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:22.000
 meditation, by our lineage blessings. It's poured.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:32.830
 And with that poured, what is dispelling? Dispel the duality, the habit patterns, those unnecessary

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.000
 things that are all dispelled.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:47.010
 Very dispelled in a great emptiness, great wisdom status is dispelled. And that is known as the Tor

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:53.000
u and the Lok. Then they say there's a word also, Abhi.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:07.490
 Abhi has meaning, also actualizing. Abhi means direct perceptions, direct status. So this, again,

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.000
 that is the same thing as we have been talking.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:19.460
 This realization is not just we're waiting for to come, but this discovery is instant. This

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:27.000
 discovery is right now. We're going to behold. We're going to experience this.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:35.800
 Therefore, it is Abhi. Abhi right now. We're going to discover and we're going to experience of the

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.000
 form, sound, space in three various states.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:50.020
 Whether a poem, whether a song, and whether a space right now. And that is not what it means, the

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:55.000
 Abhi. Abhi and the direct perception status.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:08.940
 And that is really meaning of the Abhi Shekha or Abhi Kansa. Kansa, and this is what the

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.000
 empowerment is.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.980
 And then again, of course, empowerment itself, which we do this empowerment, and then again need

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:23.000
 the other good things, ourself, to kind of prepare ourself.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:31.390
 And first of all, the preparation is our joy and devotion. This joy and devotion is not just only

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:38.000
 during the practice or the empowerment, but always really we need this joy and devotion.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:48.120
 Always, it's very important. When we have more joy and devotion, then it makes our spiritual so

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.000
 beautiful, so special.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:07:02.790
 With all the joy and appreciation or the devotion, then our practice can almost become very, very

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:04.000
 weak.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:13.620
 Not just only that, then practice can almost become, what's it called? Expired. Expired, the kind

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:15.000
 of dead stems.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 What's called? We see stems on the other foots. Sometimes expression dead is this and this, this.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 And we like to keep up this fresh. Then joy and devotion is really that, that will keep the fresh.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:42.250
 Fresh, and not just keep the fresh of the practice, but just keep the fresh of our courage,

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:48.000
 confidence, ourself, more meaningful.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:56.800
 Life becomes very meaningful. And we have the joy and the appreciation, devotion. Life is not just

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:03.000
 boring, boring, and also not just we are dragging down here.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 Then life becomes very joyful, meaningful, rewarding, as mentioned before. It's very, very special.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:17.390
 It's not just we feel, we are fulfilling something beautiful. It's not just a feeling that, but

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:19.000
 truly we have that.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:27.970
 We're making beautiful impression to ourself, our life, and meaning, and a hit. We're making

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:30.000
 beautiful impressions.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 Every step becomes quite good. We can look back, we did good. Life is beautiful. Good.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:45.290
 We can look ourself now, we're doing good. We are happy. We're nice. We look ahead, it will be the

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:46.000
 same.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:54.110
 It will be continued. And therefore, joy and devotion and appreciation are not just only during the

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:57.000
 practices, but always it's really important.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:04.250
 Then practice time is so important. The practice makes so special, so meaningful. It creates a

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:06.000
 situation, a circumstance.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 It's so perfect to practice. I mean, we have that. It's just like planting the seed in the garden.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:19.250
 Garden, soil is good, and then there is like beautiful, perfect moisture, beautiful sunshine,

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:26.000
 perfect temperature, and then just a brand of growth without any doubt.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:35.750
 Similarly, this joy and devotion and appreciation, I'm saying, this is really so special. They are

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:41.000
 like sun. They are the one preparation. They are the perfect soil.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 We have that, then we can move forward. Our spiritual result is right here.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 So therefore, then those, of course, practice time, empowerment time is very, very important.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:01.980
 Then, when we receive empowerment or when we receive empowerment, where we are practicing, where we

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:09.000
 are visualizing, like things, what things we have to also try to not think.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 Intellectual ideas. Intellectual ideas, of course, when we are studying, are so important.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:23.770
 When we are studying, learning those times, encouraging, asking, questioning, those are all

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:25.000
 important.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 That's why the Buddha Shakyamuni said in the teaching, "You must exam yourself."

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:36.980
 You are studying, and that's what the Buddhism always called three wisdoms, wisdom of studying,

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:39.000
 wisdom of contemplations.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:50.260
 Contemplation is inquiry, discussing, thinking, analyzing, answering, and discussing, and those are

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.000
 all what are so important.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:59.230
 But when it comes to the practice, such as meditation, or the practice of the visualization, and

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:04.000
 such as also empowerment, then we should not question it.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:13.000
 That time, question, discussing, encouraging things, all put in sight.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:23.700
 You must stay in the course, course of that, and stay with joy, devotion, meditate, as in the

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:28.000
 teaching set, or as in the empowerment and stalking set.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.000
 Be in that status, with confidence, courageous.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 And this is also in anybody in the teaching, and I see it that many of you know.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000
 When we have that confidence, it's called fearlessness, fearlessness status.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:52.000
 If we start questioning during the practice, during our meditation, we are invited to ego cling,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 and we are shaking our meditation.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:05.300
 We are really undermining that, and therefore, we should put all those in sight, put completely

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:08.000
 sight, and be in that state.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 Then, definitely, we receive empowerment, we practice in that, also practice time.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:24.530
 So, those are very important, and so that means joy, devotion, and as well as our, in a way,

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:28.000
 confidence, being in that state.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000
 Unshakable meditation, and stable status.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000
 And that is the practice, and then there is the empowerment.
