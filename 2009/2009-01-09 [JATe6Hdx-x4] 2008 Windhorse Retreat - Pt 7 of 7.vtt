 [Silence]

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 And now we just do that ceremony of consecrating the spray of flakes, again this area places,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.080
 with our inspiration, with all of our inspiration, toghede, and then in walking the blessings of

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.000
 the Buddha Dharma Sangha,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 of blessings of the body, the mind of the old Buddha's enlightened beings,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 and we kind of complement that blessings to the object of interaction and the spray of flakes,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 as we raise up this spray of flakes with good intention. So that is just really, again, what we do.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 And now... Okay, so now we do this consecration.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 Yeah.
