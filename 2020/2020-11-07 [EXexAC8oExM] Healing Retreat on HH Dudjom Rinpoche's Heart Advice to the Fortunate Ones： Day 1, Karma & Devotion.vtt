00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 Thank you very much for participating and for coming through with us today. We are going

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 to reflect on the teachings of our greatest teachers, for the Shakyamuni, and all the great

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 masters, great practitioners, to really activate these teachings throughout the centuries and

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 throughout the younger generations. Today, we are again following their footsteps,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 accurately that's what they did, and kind of re-standing our courage and commitment

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 and confidence in the Dharma with joy and appreciation. Therefore, this is one of, again,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 a beautiful moment in our lives. Life is precious. Life is precious. Life is also, in one way,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 in a short time. But so meaningful in this life, this time, in these circumstances,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 is really wonderful. It's not just the only way of making a matter of beauty with it.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 For our own kind of small goal or kind of an excluded situation. But we are combining.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 The greatest teachers, the brother Shakyamuni's teaching, both each other,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 is the best thing of all living beings. According to our best capabilities,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 we can't line up to that direction. Truly, it is wonderful. It's beautiful.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 Because it is kindness, it's compassion, it's respect and appreciation to everyone.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 Life brings peace and harmonious. Locally and largely. And all the beings beyond the boundaries.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 Truly, that is so sweet. So good. There is no single living beings don't like happiness and peace.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 And they appreciate it. We are lining up to that direction. And we practice it.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 Therefore, it is so sweet and so wonderful. Again, for those reasons,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 always in the teaching seat, activating the motivations. Activating the motivations.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:35.830
 This is not just a casual talk. Kind of just saying it is really touching to the nugget, to the

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.000
 root.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 Every, our activities, our actions, all start with mind, motivation.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 There is no single one activity that does not really start with mind.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 Unless something is kind of drunk or intoxicated or out of mind, then maybe that.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 But otherwise, every action what we do, it is activated, accelerated,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:20.330
 it is fueled up by how this invisible mind or monkey mind, it is. Therefore, to correct it, to

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.000
 activate it is the most important.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 When we practice it down, that's what all God has said and every one of us says.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 So motivation is so important. And what in the teaching seat, and you all know,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 I am a reminder actually, you all know this. It is not something that I am talking new things that

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 we never heard, or you never heard.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 If mind is good, activity will be good. That means mind is virtuous, the activity will be virtuous.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 And all mind, if mind is good, activity will be positive.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 If mind is bad, no matter how looks and appears, it is bad.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 There is no two different ways to go. It is all dependent within our mind.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 Therefore, in the teaching always, activated the motivation of the good.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:29.710
 It is also what we activated the good because we have so many minds. There is not just one or two

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:30.000
 minds.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 There are so many conceptions aligned up to the invisible status to activate it.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 Every term that all invisible, those mind, mental activity aligned, our mental invisible status,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 every directed that in the good's positive, they all turn into good.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 And no one is directed that, do good mind, do bad mind, no one except one's own son.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 Therefore, good motivation is the key. What we like to get that is all.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 It is completely dependent upon that. So therefore, activate the good motivations.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000
 And that good motivation, as you all know, and we said, and I said, and you all know,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 I mean, this is, again, joyful and appreciative.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 Remote joy, more appreciative. Even in life, we have difficulty with these things.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 But there are so many reasons to be happy in joy.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 And plus, we have this beautiful life, beautiful endowments or 18 endowments with all luckiness.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 Activated that with gratitude, graceful, gratitude.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 Activated that, that when we do that, that is dharma.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 That is not just dharma, that is the heart, condition, dharma, the essential of dharma.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:13.500
 Joy and appreciation. To our son, joy and appreciation of the situation and the circumstance that

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.000
 we are surrounded by.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 And then that joy and appreciation is not just only kind of only our son's joy,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.250
 but that you kind of activate that joy and swinging that to the power beyond of our really evil

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:29.000
 capabilities

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 of the physical or verbal belief, then bodhicam, bodhicam, remote joy, bodhicam attitude.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 The Materia, I'm going to reflect the teaching of the great sikkhya Buddha Kedemuni,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 a lineage master's.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.540
 May that become one of the great cause to bring the joy and the peace, happiness for all living

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:50.000
 beings

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.610
 and remove their suffering and the difficulty, the cause of the suffering and the difficulty from

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:55.000
 ever.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:02.280
 Really wishing that strongly, with courage and commitment, confidence, kind of like fairnessness

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:03.000
 like this,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:09.750
 without any blockage of this, kind of like strenghy or kind of limited boundaries. Really wish that

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:10.000
.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 That is known as bodhicam. You all know that.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 And then in the teaching always, you also see the beautiful stages of every three things.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:26.750
 According to the Buddha teaching and according to all the great masters, nature is so pure, perfect

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:27.000
.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 And all the thousands are known as the three various stages, and we use so many people.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
 We all are very unpractical. We know that.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 When we do the visualization, we see ourselves as Buddha.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 We see the song as our, the song of Buddha, the voice of the enlightenment.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 Whole medulla is like Buddha's status. Bring up that realization.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 That is not just pertaining to which reality it is.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
 That's stated according to the teaching.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:05.000
 We don't see that now because of the cataracts of the duality, publication.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:12.520
 We don't see. When we remove the cataracts of duality by our practices, that realization is right

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:13.000
 here.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 And for that reason, great master, his own Dunu Rumel said, one of his last teachings, he said,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:27.000
 said that the beautiful pure land, the beautiful, lovely pure land is right with you.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 And we put it by our dualities. He really said in his teachings, this was his dreams.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 That, as many of you may have read that booklet, which is translated.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 And what in the teaching is it?

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 [speaking in foreign language]

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 Have you really liked to have discovered that, called pure land?

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
 Put it by our dualities.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 If you put it by our duality, the beautiful, lovely, comfortable pure land is right with you.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
 And that teaching is it.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 And I'm just translating it roughly.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 But you can, they've translated this teaching to translate it.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
 You can look at it. That is really, that's it.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 I mean, it's everything, the beauty, the status.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 So bring up that, also at least to open that door toward that direction is so important.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
 We go forward and then we reflect the teaching.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 This teaching is, of course, we've been kind of continuing this spring.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 This spring, we had great opportunity to reconnect back to the teaching

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 of the great teacher of his own, the Dujurumuji.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 And we went through this.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 I mean, his own Dujurumuji.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 We write teachings that requires entirely Buddha teaching, or Nanyana teachings.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 Entire Buddha teaching.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 Do you want his teaching?

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 And all the way with the Jnana teaching, and all the way with Dzogchen, Ati-Yoga teachings.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
 But we went this teaching.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
 Which is translated here, here, what is said here.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 Here, you all know.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 The heart advice for the 14th month by his own Dujurumuji.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
 Heart advice for the 14th month.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 This is one of his kind of condensed, simple, dreaded, pit-enstructing teachings.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 And it is, it is so simple, conventional thought.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 Particularly, this is really teaching, why I'm saying pit-enstructing.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 Because those people who really like to put in practice, into practices.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
 It is a very beautiful instruction.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 That contains the essence of the meaning of the Buddha teachings.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 All the teaching of the entire, all those great master teachings here.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
 How to practice.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 How to activate it.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
 How to bring the realization.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 Not just the intellectual status.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 Not God can't just say they can't talk it.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 But observing the teaching, into the heart and brain the realization.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:15.000
 As Buddha did, as Guru Pemma Sambago, all those great master achieved.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
 And his own Dzogchen himself.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 That's what they follow that.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
 That's why his heart advice.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 From his heart, his realization.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 What he practiced, what he meditated.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 And what he actually liked.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
 His sharing that.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 To those who are fortunate practices.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 We are all fortunate practices.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:45.410
 According to the teaching of the Buddha Dhanu, generally obtaining the 18 colleges of the human

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:46.000
 life.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
 It's so precious.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
 With that, the strength in the mind, some renewals.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 Interest in the joy and the devotee to Dharma is so spacious.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 So our physical luxuries is we have the luxury of the physical of the eating endowment.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 We have luxuries of the mental state of the earth.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 Joy and the devotee to Dharma.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 So that means our body is fortunate.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 Our mind is fortunate if I use that word.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 How lucky we are.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000
 This lucky and this fortunate not just came by accidentally or itself.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 Truly we earn that.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
 Our past deeds.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 According to the Buddha Dzogchen, there's nothing is happening with the cause and affectors.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
 Without cause and condition.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 If you see the good result, that tells there is good cause and good condition.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
 Support to bring that growth.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 So, for us in our life, our situation is quite good.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 That means we need good.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 But that's not enough.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 We have to climb up.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
 We have to climb widely and continually move.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 We have to advance.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 Advance for ourselves, advance for all the beings.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
 That is our commitment.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
 What kind of commitment maybe you think?

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 Both each other.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 Believe many of you, we all got the bodhicata vow.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000
 Not just a rapidly vow, we did bodhicata vow eagerly.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
 Eager.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:40.000
 Bodhicata vow is not just a kind of like symbolic, kind of like melodic, ceremonial things.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 It is really making commitment.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
 Commitment to ourself.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:54.040
 We are never going to fail down our compassion, our loving kindness, our thought, and correlating

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:55.000
 commitment.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 Or to benefit one's own self, or to benefit all the living beings.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
 We met that commitment.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 We said when we take bodhicata vow, what do we say?

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:14.000
 From today, now on, until I reach enlightenment and all the sentient beings are freed from the

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.000
 sufferings,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 I will follow exactly you, Buddhas, in the bodhisattvas of death.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 I will do everything what you did.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 That is it.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 Clearly with our mind.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
 We don't disturb by mind.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 With the chemicals or toxicities, or pressured by someone, warm, truly, openly, joyfully,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000
 we will say that today we will follow your footsteps.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
 That is bodhicata.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
 Brahma is bodhicata.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
 Again, it is bodhicata.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
 It is not something strange or anything.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:59.000
 We reactivate our compassion, our goodness, our loving kindness, that combined commitment.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 And call it with it.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 Therefore, it is already a wonderful situation, wonderful things.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 For those reasons, we are talking about this.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:15.000
 In this teaching, again, we went this last time, so I'm going today where we started last time.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 We went through this.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:26.000
 This, until this first line, from first line, first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth lines.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
 We went through the sixth lines.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 We went through this, like, trust that three jubils are the infallible source for rafuddhi.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.000
 We went through the, kind of, little bit, details of the meaning of the rafuddhi.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 Details of the Buddha, or the object of rafuddhi.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000
 Details, little bit, details of the, about the Buddha.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 Little bit, detail of the dharma.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 Little bit, detail of the sandals.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000
 One bit of the rafuddhi, again, in kumahayana teaching, when we tell rafuddhi,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 we say, even taking rafuddhi is best of compassion.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000
 Taking all living beings, there, I like to help every being, everyone,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 and therefore, I'm going to take rafuddhi.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
 So, this is best of the bodhijata.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000
 So, in that sense, bodhijata is so important, we went, then bodhijata.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
 After rafuddhi, we went bodhijata.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:23.000
 When you come to the bodhijata, bodhijata can be, not can be, it's divided into two.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 Wishing bodhijata and actualizing bodhijata.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000
 We went, those fight thoroughly, of each of those.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000
 When you come to the actualizing bodhijata, then what is that?

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 Then that is six paramatas.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000
 We went six paramatas, all those six paramatas.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.000
 Again, quite kind of thoroughly, and of course, there's many things to say there,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
 but quite thoroughly of those six paramatas.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:57.000
 Again, the six paramatas is, vishin bodhijata is, essence of vishin bodhijata

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
 is called boneless, as you all know.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:09.000
 That is boneless love, boneless compassion, boneless joy, and boneless equanimities.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:15.000
 And that means love, compassion, joy or rejoice, and equanimity.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 Those are called boneless.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000
 How do that practice? I think many of you already know.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
 First, boneless joy.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:31.000
 May all living beings have a happiness and a cause of happiness.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 And that is loving kindness, boneless love.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
 And the second is, may all living beings

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000
 prefer suffering, cause of suffering.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 That is boneless compassion.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000
 And then, third one, boneless rejoice of joy.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000
 May all living beings are never separated

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 from the supreme joy, which is without suffering.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.000
 That is simple rejoice of joy.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:08.000
 May every living being have the great realization of equanimity

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 for the attachment to the close ones, rejection to the others.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 Others, and that is great economicism.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000
 Those are, in the teaching making,

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
 in a regular grade masters, in Timbasi,

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
 is the essence of the vishin bodhijata.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 Essence.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
 Sukha, when we have the time, even we can chime.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000
 Even you are not on a kind of like, on your meditate and Christian spirit.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000
 Have you chime those really prayers?

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 Reflection meaning to those words is so powerful, so special.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
 It's so powerful.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000
 Accumulating the merit and purifying of all obstacles.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 Really, casually, kind of so simple, kind of like very quietly,

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
 just reflecting.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.000
 May all living beings have happiness and a cause of happiness.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:07.000
 That means may all living beings have the earth of peace and cause of peace.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:13.000
 May all living beings have the harmony and the cause of the harmonious.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000
 Have you, have behind that.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000
 That is not pertaining practices.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 They are calling Buddhism, that is heart of the practices.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000
 Also so sweet, it has no kind of like,

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000
 the stains of the grass or ego cleanings.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 Self-importance.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000
 No self-importance, self-centred mind.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.000
 May all living beings have the happiness and the cause of happiness.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 May all living beings have peace and cause of peace.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:55.000
 May all living beings have the harmony and the cause of harmonious.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:02.000
 Artury does prayers wisely, cause and resolve.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 And when you have the cause of that,

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000
 that resolve last long time or the fruit last long time.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 So we pray in that.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000
 So all, and that the essence of the wishing body.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000
 In any teaching, say it, how you exercise,

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:25.000
 train your mind of the wishing body, do that.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000
 It is so powerful, as I say, in the teaching, Buddha teaching.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000
 It is instantly glorified obscuration, negativities.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000
 It brings the instant light in our mind and heart.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:43.000
 And then when that happens, it will bring us to joy and peace, happiness.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 What we are guiding, it will bring us to us.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 This is not just a making story, a period, a methodology.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:58.000
 You can witness to yourself, or we can witness to ourselves.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:03.000
 If we find that, stay our mind to that stage and we find those prayers.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000
 You see what change comes.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 And that means we change all those cells of the bloaters,

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000
 breathing, the whole circle.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:21.000
 The entitlement, the allow of the gallets of the body is really transforming.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000
 It is so healing, powerful healing, purpose, strength.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.000
 Different healing, all the emotions, negativities.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:38.000
 Those like, those emotions, whatever the resolution is left, it will heal.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000
 We don't like to stay in that shadow, in that darkness forever.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.000
 We don't like to leave this body with that shadow in a dark way.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000
 We have to clean the body by that.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000
 That is known as Buddhism, practicing Dharma.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:02.000
 That is Dharma, those are essential Dharma, the central of Dharma's Dharma.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.000
 Then with this thought, now let's help to all the sentient beings.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:13.000
 Let's help to stay the beings, with that attitude, that attitude.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:18.000
 Not with the ego cleaning, not with the self-important,

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000
 but let's help to the other beings.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.000
 Then, the six paramatas, we went to those six paramatas.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:31.000
 Six paramatas, again I listed that, and we put the old,

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 generalized paramatas, morality paramatas, patience paramatas,

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:50.000
 and then joyful effort to the virtuous paramatas, concentration paramatas.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 And then, Panyak paramata, or the wisdom paramatas.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 Those are known as six paramatas.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:08.000
 All are vast and rooted and inseparable with the poor, boundless.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:14.000
 Generous paramata is inseparable with the poor, boundless.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 Morality paramata is inseparably with the poor, boundless.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:26.000
 Poor, boundless is the nutrition of the six paramatas.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:34.000
 All poor, boundless is the vitality of the six paramatas, all that.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:39.000
 And then, of course, this deters in the divisions and all that extends,

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.000
 but all is rooted to the poor, boundless.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000
 If we don't count the poor, boundless, we count the,

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:51.000
 kind of bring down, boiling down, then it's compassion.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:56.000
 It's compassion. All is best on the compassion.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:04.000
 Six paramatas is best absolutely on the compassion.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 That is what all these bodhisattas, bodhisattas and bodhisattva activities.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000
 And we went through those.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000
 Today, we go on this now.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:32.000
 Next one is, is, is, what's called the next line, and so not, so.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:42.000
 And, and do not be mistaken about the resolve of the virtues and unvirtues, actions, actions.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:48.000
 And then, as well as here, in particular, devoted to the root teachers.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:55.000
 Next one is love and affection for the Samaya brothers and sisters.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:01.000
 And the bodhisattva of the compassion towards all mothers and beings.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:06.000
 And the reducer of the grasping due to the knowledge that all,

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.000
 all, uh, completed things are impermanence.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.000
 And the next one, this is summaries.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.000
 Are known as the poor, everlasting wealth of the practitioner

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:24.000
 and should be regarded as indispensable.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:31.000
 So these poor or pious are so important, they are the wealth of the practitioners.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:38.000
 And a great master, his son, the dujalum, which he highlighted that,

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 which is not his thing, but just every master's in the teaching state.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000
 These poor or pious, what mind?

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000
 Pious, what means pious?

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.000
 Pious, I'm talking about this one too.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:59.000
 Do not mistake about the result and unvirtues, actions.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000
 If you count that one, it's there to become pious.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:08.000
 If you count every day as in the teaching state, all those are pious, poor.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000
 These poor or pious are so important.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:18.000
 It's important during the practices, that means during the meditation practices,

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 this is important during the post-meditation, when you're not meditating,

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.000
 particularly, or when we are in war.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:33.000
 War, it is all, always remember this, this four or five.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:38.000
 The big one is cause and effect that are inevitable.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000
 All right, that's the beginning time.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:52.000
 This cause and effect are inevitable, therefore, our actions always be thoughtful,

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:58.000
 mindful, whatever we do, it has resolved.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:05.000
 We do something, whatever it echoes back, back, activities, everything.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:11.000
 This is called law of karma. In the Buddha teaching, it's called law of karma.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:17.000
 Karma can be divided, actually, how on death, produced, there's two ways.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:25.000
 It's called mental activities and physical verbal activities.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:35.000
 If I say more, another way, the mental karma and verbal karma and physical karma.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:45.000
 Karma is action, so mental action, physical action, verbal action.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:51.000
 This action can be divided in the Buddha teaching, three actions.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:59.000
 Positive action, negative action, and neutral actions.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:10.000
 And so, positive action, negative action, has definitely big result, big consequence.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:19.440
 Neutral is a letter, this sense is so neither positive nor negative, it has less effect, less

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:21.000
 consequence.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:30.000
 But positive and negative are really so, always there is consequence behind.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:37.000
 Even we didn't see that, like that moment, according to Buddhism, it is.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:47.000
 And what the teaching says, everything, what we experience, what we go through, is karma.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:55.000
 It is karma, nothing is happening with all the activities.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:06.000
 This karma is not somebody overloaded us, suddenly, or it didn't come from somewhere else.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.000
 Or it accidentally appeared.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:15.000
 Karma is all connected to our own actions.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:23.000
 Action of the mind, action of the physical, action of the world.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:33.000
 And mental actions are the cause of the world to those actions, physical, verbal actions.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:39.000
 So therefore, we have to be totally thoughtful, as much as we can.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:47.000
 Even for example, any kind of like, unwholesome mental activities arising in our mind,

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:53.000
 not kind of like hovering over that again and again and again and then.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.000
 Let it go, let it go.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:03.000
 If it is going over, but it will, of course, depend how that stone is.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:10.000
 Some kind of a strong emotion is odd, like negative emotion is hovering in the mind.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.000
 It disturbs all our systems.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:21.000
 As I said earlier, poor, boneless thought will bring such a light in all our system of bodies.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000
 But this negative thought is the same.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:34.000
 It really will bring so many unbeneficial resolve the whole our system of the bodies.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:44.850
 What they call stress force, anxieties, then deep rations, then begin to build self-lamens,

00:30:44.850 --> 00:30:45.000
 disappointments.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:56.060
 All those counts, one after another, this all is mostly producing, produced by our mind, one's own

00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:57.000
 mind.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000
 Maybe there is some consequence, but every hand is so well.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.000
 Then, those are not going to affect us too much.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000
 That's what is called Bodhisattvas.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:14.000
 Sattva means courageous ones, warriors.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:19.000
 Why? The greatest teacher of Bodhisattva kamuni named warriors.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:24.560
 Sometimes there are so many of those difficulties, troubles, it looks like they are coming from

00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:25.000
 outside.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.000
 And then we cope with that, and then we become, we perish.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000
 We become the victim.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:39.760
 But if you are courageous and strong, and you handle that well without accessing and going on, and

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:46.000
 on, and on, and on, on, then you defeat it in a way.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000
 Really. Not in a way of defeating.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:56.280
 You have to do such that, then when you have that attitude, you have more skills, more wisdom, more

00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:58.000
 capability to handle things.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000
 Ah, you see, so nice.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.360
 Therefore, so many of those great masters, looks like they got so many troubles, one after a

00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:09.000
 greater practice, and really one after another.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:17.000
 But all that subsided, and they are glowing as sunshine in the sky, free from the clothes.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000
 True, they are warriors.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000
 That's what called warriors.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:29.000
 Never affected their body together. Never affected their identity. They call it us. Call us.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:38.000
 So therefore, therefore, how we handle things is so, really so important, so necessary.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000
 Therefore, we are trying to handle things.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 But at the same time, whatever activity we start happening, we are always caught.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000
 Mindfulness is our actions.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000
 Karma is what?

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:57.000
 Then again, every good letter determines of this karma, then positive mind, negative minds.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 Karma is not coming from outside.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.000
 It's from all produced by our mind.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.000
 As I said, mental activities.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:14.000
 Mental activity reflected to the verbal and physical, then it becomes the full bloom of karma.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:19.000
 The full growth of the karma appears.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.000
 And those are positive minds.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:32.000
 What we in the teaching said, positive mind is detachment, loving-kindness, compassion, and wisdom.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.000
 Those are the positive minds.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:43.000
 Whatever the activity we did with the verbally, we, and physically, that is positive karma,

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.000
 positive actions.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.000
 And the opposite of those what?

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:52.000
 Is ignorance, attachment, and anger.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.000
 Anger or combination without those.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:02.000
 What that is produced is mind, mind, and whatever the activity that becomes negative.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:08.000
 These negative ideas are then summarized in the Buddha teaching.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:14.000
 He could highlight those 10 non-virtues.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:20.000
 Those are the naturally negative ideas.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000
 10 non-virtues.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000
 And I'm not going to list that.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.000
 You all know that.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.000
 We all know that.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:36.940
 So 10, 3 by the voting, 3 on virtues by the voting, 4 on virtues by the verbal, and 3 by the mental

00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:38.000
 states.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:43.000
 Those are known as 10 non-virtues.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000
 Everything is bad.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:50.980
 But regularly, the 3 mental states, last one, in the Buddha teaching said, that's the very heavy

00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:52.000
 stones.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.000
 When mind is bad, it is bad.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:04.000
 So therefore, these last 3, the 3 minds, have to be really very powerful, that activity.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:10.000
 And then positive, 10 positives, opposite of those 10 virtues, is positive.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.000
 All positive, that means this virtue is good.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000
 That result will be good.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:23.000
 Therefore, following those activities, above that, those are the 10 non-virtues, common.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:27.000
 And above that, if you take the vows, because Buddha teaching,

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:36.000
 then there's vows, such as Vinaya vows, and Bodhisattva vows, and Varyana vows.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000
 Those are, then, extract.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.000
 Additionally, we do against with those.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.000
 And we can't completely contradict with that.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:49.000
 Even if we talk vows, or with a single teaching, we talk vow openly,

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.000
 with a heart, with a clear mind, and we take that against it,

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000
 then you become naked with it.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.000
 And what you do then? Then purify it. Cleaning with it.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.000
 And, in such cases, we do the Hindu practices.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000
 Poor vows for the Varyasattva practices.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000
 Those are so powerful.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:13.000
 With meditation of the Varyasattvas, and even poor vows, as stuck to it in the teaching,

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000
 it will clean, it will clean, it will purify.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000
 And the teaching said, as soon as you see some mistakes,

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:26.000
 that you've got a weakness of your Samayas, all those obstacles,

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000
 immediately trying to purify.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:35.000
 The great master in the teaching said, the great master, Aditya said,

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.000
 said that, what in the teaching said?

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:44.000
 He said, he never, you know, he'd be perfect,

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:51.000
 I may be this way, he never had trouble with keeping the vows of the Varyas.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:56.000
 But he had some difficulties of the difficulties of keeping the vows

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000
 and the bodies of the vows.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:03.000
 And then, in many other vows, he has quite a little bit more difficult

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000
 to keep the vows.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:12.000
 But he said, he never said, even one night, we don't purify, not purify.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.000
 So that means, immediately he purified.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.000
 We can make mistakes, we had some sort of things,

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.000
 but not just ignoring that and just going down again and again,

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.000
 but immediately purify them.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:32.000
 He said, he never accompanied or can't be left overnight without purifying.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:37.000
 This great master said, so this is the relief that we can do,

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.000
 or even we can do immediately, but as much as we can do,

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:48.000
 soon, as soon as possible, it plays with that,

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.000
 this and our practices.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:38:01.000
 So that is really about the first one.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:07.000
 So that, this is again, this one is the virtues and the unvirtuous actions,

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:11.000
 which should always be thoughtful, whether we are practicing

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:16.000
 and whether we are in the world.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.000
 But regularly, of course, in the world, we have to be very careful.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:24.000
 But during all the practices, as I said, in the Buddha's teachings,

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.000
 there are two kinds of activities, mental activities

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:32.000
 and verbal and physical activities.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.000
 And even during practices, I have some kind of like,

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:40.000
 unwholesome thought and mental state, trying to immediately purify.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.000
 Notice that and not stay too long, like that.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.000
 And then with those thoughts, whatever activity did,

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.000
 in the world, we are not ready to do any practices,

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:56.000
 definitely purify and also careful with mindful steps.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.000
 So that is really about these first lines.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:04.000
 The next one is here, particularly devotion to the teachers.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000
 The one to the root teachers.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000
 That, I mean, many of you already know,

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.000
 we heard these teachings always this.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.000
 And in the Buddha's teachings, teachings are so important.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:19.000
 Teachers, particularly known as qualified teachers,

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.000
 are really so important.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:24.000
 This is not just on the way they are teaching,

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000
 but also the ultimate Buddha's teachings.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.000
 What is the ultimate Buddha's teaching?

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:34.000
 This is what is generally the qualification of the teachers.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.000
 There is many different explanation and way to explain

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.000
 in the teaching, in the Vinaya teaching,

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.000
 in the Bodhisattva teaching, in the Vedayana teaching.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.000
 And that could be simple by maybe I just say,

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:51.000
 I am making few times before, so I won't maybe go over that.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:57.000
 But one simple by this is what the great master Chantideva said in the teaching.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:06.000
 There, he said two simple qualities.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.000
 The teacher should have two simple qualities.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.000
 The always teacher, one who is,

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:18.000
 knows very well about the meaning of the Mahayana teachings.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000
 So that means the Buddha teaching.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:24.000
 That is the wisdom aspect.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:30.000
 Wisdom aspect of the knowing the Buddha teaching clearly.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.000
 All the teaching.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:34.000
 Second qualification is,

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:40.000
 and the vows of the Bodhisattva never going to give up

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:45.000
 even the cost of the lives.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.000
 Bodhisattva, vows of the Bodhisattva,

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:54.000
 or the conduct of the Bodhisattvas, never going to give up

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.000
 even the cost of the lives.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.000
 That means it is Bodhisattva.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:05.000
 Bodhisattva is loving kindness, compassion and wisdom.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:10.000
 So that teacher must have loving kindness,

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:14.000
 compassion, wisdom and courage and commitment,

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:19.000
 confidence and maintaining valuable teachings.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:23.000
 Exiling teaching, as he said, by that teacher,

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:27.000
 whether she or whether he, that mentoring.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:33.000
 That teacher is known as spiritual, perfect friend.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:36.000
 Perfect friend.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:46.000
 Teacher are, whether he or he, are your friend.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:47.000
 Friend.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.000
 One who is going to influence you,

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:54.000
 when he is going to support you, influence you on the right direction.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:59.000
 Therefore he is going to be a spiritual friend, a virtuous friend.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:06.000
 There is two friends called un-virtuous friends and virtuous friends.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:12.000
 Teacher qualified teacher is a virtuous friend.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.000
 Friends.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:18.000
 This teacher can be divided in the teaching set.

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:22.000
 That teacher can be divided, that teacher can be divided.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:26.000
 The teacher can be, there is four different teachers.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:30.000
 As mentioned earlier, again I have listed them.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:36.000
 Those are ordinary teacher, or ordinary perfect teacher,

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:42.000
 bodhisattva teacher, narmakaya teacher and sambokaya teacher.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:50.000
 So four teachers, ordinary teacher, bodhisattva teacher

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:54.000
 and narmakaya teacher, narmakaya Buddha teacher,

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:58.000
 sambokaya Buddha teacher, four teachers.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:05.000
 This ordinary teacher, teacher is what I said

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:11.000
 in describing qualification that bodhisattva, narmakaya Buddha

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:14.000
 and sambokaya Buddha don't have an exam.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.000
 It is already qualified.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:27.000
 But sambokaya is the only teacher as grandma's shanti deva said, true godness.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.000
 Who knows all the Buddha teachings,

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:33.000
 who are going to keep the conduct of the bodhisattva perfectly,

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:37.000
 never going to give up even the cost of their lives.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:43.000
 That is the only teacher.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:47.000
 This ordinary is not just a regular ordinary teacher.

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:51.000
 In the subject, I saw translated in Indonesia said

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.000
 perfect ordinary teacher.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:57.000
 So it is a perfect definition, it is very correct.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:01.000
 Extra ordinary, ordinary teachers.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:06.000
 That teacher has those qualities.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:09.000
 If you have that quality of that teacher,

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:13.000
 but that is that like in the teaching said,

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:17.000
 you got the mining of the gold mining.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.000
 You have to trade.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.000
 You are right to trade all of the gold mining.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.000
 If you are looking to understand of the brain,

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000
 some really understand what the Buddha teaching

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:31.000
 and it is going to be according to the teaching of the bodhisattva community,

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.000
 that is really excellent.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:37.000
 For that reason, great teacher bodhisattva community said

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:40.000
 in the Pandya Paramana teachings,

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.000
 that if you like to reach the enlightenment of the Buddhahood,

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:49.000
 immediately you contract with the qualified teachers.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.000
 Immediately qualified teachers.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:55.000
 This qualified teacher, in the minute teaching says,

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.000
 oh, you should exam the teachers.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.000
 You should listen carefully,

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:05.000
 see the conductors and read the lifestyles, all those things.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.000
 And then finally you connect with them.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:11.000
 Also, I, the teaching, said that those who really like to do those

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:14.000
 and have time to do, have capabilities.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:17.000
 But otherwise, that one who has this,

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.000
 who knows the Buddha teaching quite well

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:24.000
 and maintaining all the teachings that what teaching says,

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.000
 or what teacher she or he is talking,

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.000
 talking kind of maintain quite well

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:32.000
 and doing the line up to the total that with teaching is,

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:35.000
 then it's quite a good teacher, quite a good teacher,

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.000
 quite a good teacher, and that is that.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.000
 You know, one of the teachers said,

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:44.000
 for us, for example, for us, only the beings,

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:51.000
 when you see only those good teachers is so special.

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:54.000
 Through that only special teacher,

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:57.000
 we can find the bodhisattva teachers,

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:00.000
 we can find the magaya teachers,

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.000
 we can find some magaya teachers,

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:07.000
 with all the contract and post teacher of that only good teacher,

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:13.000
 we were never going to get up there to be qualified to the same teaching.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:17.000
 So therefore, when we improve ourselves with the ordinary teacher,

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:22.000
 practice and meditate, and then all other teachers really went forward.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.000
 This then post teacher,

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.000
 also in Gohe Garmadana teaching,

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.000
 those are the six different teachers.

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.000
 Major, six different teachers.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:34.000
 Teachers, those are our general teachers,

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.000
 and one who is actually the part,

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:39.000
 teacher of the one who is actually the teachings,

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.000
 one who is educating the teachings,

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.000
 teacher, one who is educating,

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:46.000
 one is always supporting the help and consulting

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:49.000
 and kind of clarification and purification,

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.000
 all the things that teachers,

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:54.000
 and one is explaining the meaning of the tenderness

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:57.000
 and those big instructions,

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:00.000
 and one who is giving the big instructions.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.000
 Those are the six different teachers,

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:05.000
 which is those all six, that ordinary teachers,

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.000
 part of ordinary teachers.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:10.000
 These six different teachers is where they explain

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.000
 the six different individuals,

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:15.000
 but it can be all, can be one individual tree.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:18.000
 All can be presented that six different.

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.000
 So that teacher here,

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.000
 here teaching, that qualified teacher,

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.000
 you always have the devotions.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:28.000
 Devotions, they are confident in trust.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.000
 Follow with them.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.000
 If you find the qualified teacher,

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:35.000
 don't linger, don't doubt, don't read it.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:38.000
 Don't turn away.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.000
 Turn away from the teacher.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:41.000
 Stay with that.

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:42.000
 Ever you like them,

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:45.000
 ever you like to improve yourself

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:46.000
 through the teaching of the Buddha

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.000
 or through that teaching,

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.000
 it's really good.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.000
 Otherwise, we're making, again,

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:56.000
 missing our opportunities.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.000
 And so that is one.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:02.000
 So that means that always careful with our actions,

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:05.000
 cause and efforts are inevitable.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:10.000
 And the second is contract with the qualified teacher.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:16.000
 That is, so among these four of the practitioners,

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:20.000
 I went maybe roughly one or two.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:25.000
 Also, we are keeping the light,

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:28.000
 this is thoughtful with our actions.

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:29.000
 Gone.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:32.000
 That means simply always thoughtful with gone,

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:36.000
 thoughtful with actions, that thoughts.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:40.000
 And the second is then connect to the lineage,

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.000
 connect to the teacher.

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.000
 Keep that connection.

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:49.000
 If you like to improve that part,

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.000
 you should connect.

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:55.000
 And keep the connection with joy,

00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:00.000
 with respect, with appreciation, with devotion.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:01.000
 What any teacher says,

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.000
 then go and have another teacher say.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:04.000
 Those teachers,

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:08.000
 you should honor as like leader,

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.000
 you should honor as your uncle,

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:13.000
 you should honor there as your father,

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:16.000
 you should honor as them your mother,

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:20.000
 you should honor as your eye, eye,

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:23.000
 and you should honor their heart.

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:26.000
 See, those are really in teaching said.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:29.000
 You should honor these teachers.

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:32.000
 Respect and honor.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.000
 If you have that honor,

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:36.000
 what any great teacher,

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:37.000
 Buddha Chakra Muni said,

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000
 in Pandya Paramada teaching,

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:42.000
 if you connect with that good teacher,

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:43.000
 qualified teacher,

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:47.000
 with your devotion and learn and follow that,

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:51.000
 you will gain the same achievement,

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:55.000
 realization as that teacher has.

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:56.000
 Teacher that.

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.000
 So that's it.

00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:59.000
 And therefore,

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:02.000
 then all the good qualities of the virtues

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:07.000
 will rush out from your hidden qualities.

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.000
 Come up all that.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.000
 That is really teaching said.

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:14.000
 So that is my brief talk for today.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:15.000
 And then again,

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.000
 tomorrow we do continue.

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:21.000
 So we see how many we can go over this again

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:22.000
 as we go in this.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:23.000
 And then,

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.000
 and I'd like to talk this kind of,

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:26.000
 completed this,

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.000
 he's on the union with the teaching,

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.000
 which is so special and important.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:31.000
 You know already,

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:32.000
 he's translated what they say.

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.000
 But again,

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:37.000
 to remind each other is kind of responsible.

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:38.000
 The Sangha member,

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.000
 we all as a Sangha member,

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:41.000
 remind each others,

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:44.000
 and kind of refreshing our knowledge

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:47.000
 of the Buddha Dharma is really very good.

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:48.000
 Good to all the time.

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.000
 And it is also rituals.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:51.000
 And therefore,

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:52.000
 I'm doing this.

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.000
 I'd like to kind of complete this.

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:55.000
 So again,

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.000
 thank you very much for your participation.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:58.000
 And thank you again.

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.000
 So much for everything.

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:01.000
 Thank you.

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:02.000
 Now we do,

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:03.000
 again,

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:05.000
 just do our evening practice.

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:06.000
 If you have time,

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.000
 please join with us.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:10.000
 We do our evening practice

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.000
 of the Bhema Samyant Monastery

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:13.000
 that we will do.

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:14.000
 Together with that,

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.000
 we do that with practices also.

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:17.000
 Like meditation,

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:18.000
 practicing,

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:20.000
 to the healing practices.

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:21.000
 This time,

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:22.000
 again,

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:23.000
 in general,

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:24.000
 in the samsara days,

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:26.000
 we have all this trouble.

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:27.000
 The sickness of trouble

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:30.000
 is one of our troubles in the samsara.

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:31.000
 But this time,

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:33.000
 it's kind of like very,

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:34.000
 kind of a little bit intensified,

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:36.000
 like situation of this pandemic.

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:37.000
 So at least,

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:40.000
 we can put our good intention,

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:41.000
 our good meditation,

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.000
 as well as toad.

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:44.000
 Toad,

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:45.000
 in the Bhema Samyant Monastery,

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:46.000
 is really good for,

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:47.000
 that's what we can do

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:50.000
 for these purposes.

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:51.000
 So in what teaching says,

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.000
 do everything what you can do,

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.000
 as your best capabilities.

00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.000
 So pray is our best capabilities

00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:01.000
 to do to all these different situations.

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:02.000
 And also then,

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:05.000
 this disease sickness.

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:06.000
 So if you have time,

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:07.000
 please join us,

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:08.000
 with us,

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:10.000
 and thank again for very much everybody.

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:11.000
 Thank you.
