00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.480
 The suffering, sadness, and as well as misery can deliver despair, despair. It will dispel.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:16.980
 That is the most powerful reminisce. We are in a big emotion such as anger and jealous,

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.480
 heady thoughts and worrying, stressful. Stressful, deep breaking, all those anxiety and all that.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:31.560
 We break again joy and appreciation and both each other, really in a well subsided.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.080
 This is not just telling the story of the pretty story of the other side of the world or the planet

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.320
.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.560
 I'm talking that with our own experience. This is not it. This is the truth.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:52.540
 This will break healing our emerging scars, our all those psychological troubles, problems we have.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.480
 Really it will heal.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:03.560
 It will. It will cleanse. It will. That is known as purification. That is known as purifying,

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.480
 removal of obstacles, obscuratives.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:13.630
 Those are not. We have to be practical, not look in the other direction. That we've been doing for

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.960
 the Buddha teachings.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:20.350
 From the beginning of the time, we're looking always at the wrong time, wrong directions and

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.160
 thinking of the solutions and all these things.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:30.480
 But really the solution comes with our heart, your heart with my heart, with this moderation.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:38.110
 Knowing that way, knowing that way, therefore all the incumbents, all the beautiful things, it's

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.480
 right with us, with you and with me.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.840
 Joy and appreciation. It's not going to have to go somewhere in the search, in this and that. It's

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.480
 right with us, right with you.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:58.420
 But behind that, sweet on that, what sweet on that? Joy and appreciation. And voting. What kind is

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.480
 compatible for all living with this?

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:10.460
 Any religion, sincerity. No one is certain. I like to be suffering, suffer bad and difficulties.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.480
 Same as like me, me, I don't like to be suffered.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:24.260
 I don't like to be upset. I don't like to have pain. It's the same. Whether they can see clearly or

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.480
 can't see.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:35.810
 The feeling is the same. Feeling is the same. Pain is going through the same. This is that. And

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.480
 that we can see.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:44.610
 For example, the animal, all those, we kind of superpowers, we kind of youth type advantage. How

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:45.480
 much they're scared?

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:56.480
 How much they're really in the trouble? That we see. Pain is the same. Pain is the same. Therefore,

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.480
 when we practice down, we bring more completion, more love, more kindness.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:07.810
 And that is also where we glorify our goodness. Our beautiful, your beautiful, my beautiful. And we

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.480
 benefit. We clear our path in the directions.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:17.930
 Our disconnect. Our destination. Destination, maybe we don't know exactly where we're going. We don

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.480
't see the future clearly there.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:28.940
 Every night, bright now. Now will move continually to the now. Today is now, but this today will

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.480
 move tomorrow. Tomorrow will be bright. Tomorrow will be bright.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:40.260
 Continually showing that. We're clearing the path as we move. And bright now as we move, then

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.480
 completely believe. That is known as the now.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:51.930
 So therefore, again, we talk under the moderator, we stand in this moderator and all the, but it's

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.480
 not just that once in a while or the beginning of the practice.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:01.930
 We can keep this moderator throughout the day and the night. Really, that is being mostly powerful

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:02.480
 practices.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:09.870
 The whole practice of the teachings of the, such as the Vedayana teaching or Dzogchi teachings, the

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:16.480
 Mahamudra teaching and the Madhima teaching, become so powerful, so rich, so powerful.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:23.290
 It's just glorified. That's what these great beings like the Buddha and the Gurdapayama, all those

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.480
 great masters. So follow that footsteps in there.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:38.130
 So it goes under, and then again, we move to the end. We purely understand it and devotion, we move

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.480
 to the teaching.
