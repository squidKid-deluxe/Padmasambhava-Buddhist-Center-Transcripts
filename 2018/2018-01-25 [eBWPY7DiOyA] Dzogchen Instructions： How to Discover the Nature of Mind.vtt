00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.880
 Poem, feeling, perception, conceptions, and consciousness.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.280
 Those who know, we know, in the samsara level, we divided that and we did.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:24.880
 And among that, in the samsara, among that, all this palm feeling is so important, samsara.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:32.320
 We all completely kind of like relying on the feelings, feelings, feelings.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:42.240
 And what that feeling is, who is it analyzing, who is dividing, who is nominating that feeling?

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:48.640
 Reality level is the mind, it's nothing else, feelings.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:56.090
 Have our mind decided, even it looks like outside, something kind of harsh and difficult to trouble

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.400
, it's okay.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.920
 It's not bad, it's okay, it's beautiful, actually.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:13.430
 Our mind is not accepting things as it is, and externally it's so beautiful, so nice, and so

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:14.400
 perfect.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.240
 Our feeling is not good, we are suffering.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.360
 So, who really decided that? It's mind.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.080
 Mind is deciding that.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:33.360
 Everything is like with our habit and our mind is deciding, deciding.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.800
 So, then in the feeling level, how many feelings?

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.040
 According to the teaching, there are six feelings.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:49.760
 Or, when there is a feeling, how many feelings? Good feelings, bad feelings, and neutral feelings.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.840
 And that is divided by with six concussions.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.280
 So, six different feelings, divided as three.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:04.160
 Good feeling of the eye, bad feeling of the eye, and the neutral feeling of the eye.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:12.320
 And, as well as then, a and a nose, and a tongue, and a body, and then mental states.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.800
 So, altogether, 18 different feelings.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:24.840
 So, this feeling is not outside, it's really coming, existing, it's only the mind is directing that

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.880
.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.680
 And habit, bad things are continuing to cling onto that.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:36.000
 Those great masters who got the Realization understand everything as a great enlightenment state.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.880
 Then, what is called, "economity states".

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.000
 That's what is called "economity". One-taste Realizations.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.960
 This is not one-taste coming from outside, it's the inner-taste Realization that expresses.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.720
 Expressing all that.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:03:02.000
 And then, such as, as like, now, conceptions. Second, the most important is the conceptions.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.320
 Feeling, or maybe sorry, so perceptions.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:12.000
 Second most important ask for in samsara is perceptions.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:20.160
 Perception is ideas, beliefs, and traditions.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.480
 Those are so important. Second important in samsara is the perceptions.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:33.920
 We do so many things, everything is perfectly beautiful, but our perception is not correct.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:41.200
 We disturb everything, because we want the correct perceptions, or traditions, beliefs,

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:50.640
 or these ideas, our way of thinking, way of life. All this we make so much emphasize on this.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:58.320
 Emphasize. And where that comes from, again, is the mind.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:04.960
 So, perception, feeling is the mind, and divided and ruled by the mind.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:14.800
 And perceptions is ruled by the mind. And mind itself is what? It's empty.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:20.960
 There's nothing substantial solid existing, but yet it rules everything.

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:26.800
 Then, all the conceptions oppose mind. All is mind.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.120
 In the Buddha's teaching, there is 52 perceptions.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:37.760
 No matter what, even the numbers are, whatever how the conceptions are emanating,

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:47.120
 but all is mind. All is mind. Then consciousness is mind.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:53.120
 Conscious mind. So that means whole. And then, poems are mind, which we discussed yesterday

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.840
 in a code of Buddhism, is all through the habit of evidence, developed.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:04.480
 Poems. And everything, subject and object, and all that develop. A code of Buddhism.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:10.800
 And reality, also everything is empty. And for that reason, in hard subtle teachings,

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:16.400
 poem is emptiness, feeling is emptiness, perception is emptiness,

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.720
 conception is emptiness, consciousness is emptiness.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.640
 And they're not negation, empty, empty, blank, blank status.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:29.360
 All is also appearance. For those reasons,

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.040
 gracious teacher, Buddha used, what in hard subtle.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.640
 Emptiness, the poem, emptiness, the feeling,

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.040
 emptiness is the perception, emptiness is the conception,

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:47.120
 emptiness is the consciousness. It's arising. This is the way the nature is.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:53.440
 But reality, whatever it is, is ruling our entire environment.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:06:00.880
 Everything is ruled by the mind in samsara. That's what we really always,

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.480
 always, kind of like, accepting, rejection,

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.760
 and all the difficulty troubles, or whatever this,

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:14.880
 is all is going. And don't by this mind. Don't by nothing, but else.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.800
 Reality level, the principle, we're talking source,

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:24.240
 the boss, or the really the troublemaker, and the ruler.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:30.880
 It rules everything of our, our, our entire,

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:37.360
 entire. So that is really the mind now. And now,

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:42.480
 we, we, and then now we think, thank you. And then nirvanas,

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:47.280
 on a dharma level. All, everything what we talk,

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:51.120
 again in dharma, such as ten bhimmis, if we look,

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:57.840
 thinking of the ten bhimmis, is the mind. Ten bhimmis is the development of our

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:03.120
 mental status. Path is development of our

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:07.040
 realization of our mental status, strength.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:15.120
 And joy and appreciation is mind. Joy is mind. Appreciation is mind.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:23.040
 Respect is mind. Lowing kindness is mind. Compassion is mind.

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:28.480
 All those analyzations, expressions, and divisions, and what our

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:33.760
 teaching mentioned, all that is really mind.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:37.840
 Think that, I mean, this is what in the Buddha's teaching, you said,

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.840
 in Buddhism, what do we call it? When you practice, we have to have the

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:47.120
 confidence in the practices. Certainty, we have to have certainty,

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:51.600
 confidence. We're establishing, exactly the way things are.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:55.360
 So later, in practice, we don't have to linger in cautioning,

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:59.360
 doubt, and putting in courage and arguing again.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.880
 And this is also known as establishing the view

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:07.680
 with analytics. You're looking thoroughly, exactly as is,

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:11.680
 not just a kind of believing on what is said, but

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:19.680
 analyze, this is important to do. So you see, now that, so that means

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:25.840
 samsara is ruled by the mind and the rana is ruled by the mind.

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:31.520
 All is mind. So that is, now that's how we understand it.

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:35.520
 Mind is the principle on the relative level,

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:38.640
 relative level, relative level of the samsara,

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:45.600
 relative level of the dharma. Dharma, this mind, is so powerful and important

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:53.120
 and a presence. Now, that mind, where is that mind?

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:57.360
 That is known as then, singling out of the mind.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:03.040
 You're singling out the mind. Person, we believe, when we think, with our

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:06.880
 thought, we can't really think. Mind, what we have,

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:11.200
 actually, what we have, what ourselves, what in teaching said,

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:18.000
 body, speech, and mind. These three, that's what we have.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.920
 Person, we think, and body and speech and mind

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:26.080
 all together, kind of together. That's what really we think.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:31.680
 Without any kind of analyzation, we can't really think.

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:34.880
 But at the reality level, these three things are

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:39.440
 so different. They're not the same.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:46.480
 And what is body? Body is produced by our two elements from our parents.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:50.480
 Principally, that is what's developed, developed.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:59.440
 Anyway, it's also, it's metal, mass, M-A-S-S-A. It's mass, it's element.

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:06.880
 And its mind is the element. Or mind is water, mind is fire, mind is wind,

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:13.360
 mind is earth. No. It's completely different. And then you look,

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:19.120
 you look in mind and body, you compare. And the body has all different features.

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:22.400
 We have different features of the body. Or any different,

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:30.240
 different veins has different features of the bones. Mind has any bones,

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:37.600
 can see anything, bones, formation? No. Mind, and so therefore, and then also,

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:41.440
 of course, we can, according to Buddhism, this body has

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:48.400
 over 360 pieces of the bones, bones. And mind is not like that, we tend to

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:53.920
 mind. So mind and the bodies are completely different.

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:58.480
 They're not same. Same. Even we think it's kind of same,

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:04.560
 all together. Together. So is it different?

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:11.200
 Different. A mind is not with the body, and body is not the same as

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:15.200
 a mind is not, not like, like body. Body is not like

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:19.200
 mind. They are like different. Even they all are

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:26.080
 together in here now, in these times. And then we think of the voice.

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:32.400
 Voice is also, even though it's together, but it's not the same.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:40.000
 Mind and voice are same? No. Mind and voice are different.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:46.400
 Voice has a, we can analyze long, and short, and beautiful, and not beautiful,

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:51.280
 and all those analyzation, voice we can, and different language, and so forth.

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:57.280
 All that. The mind is completely different. It cannot divide, it cannot

00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:00.720
 analyze, cannot figure out any of those things

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:06.960
 with mind. So it's really different. Totally different. So therefore,

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:12.320
 mind, and again, voice, or the speech, is it different?

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:19.600
 Different. And then what is this mind? Mind is, again, it's, mind is, even though

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:23.120
 it's not kind of, cannot put in any of those categories,

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:27.040
 and compare in any of those, as like, togetherness. But yet,

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:30.800
 mind is rules everything, as I said so many times.

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:33.920
 And that's what gracious teacher Buddha said.

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:38.720
 Everything. If you like to make, or if we like to make happy,

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:42.080
 we should work with the mind. If we like to make

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:45.600
 peaceful, we should work with the palm. Peaceful.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.640
 That's what the gracious teacher, for example, Nagarjana said,

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:54.480
 in his teaching set. And he said, or, I mean, he's writing letter to his friend

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:59.600
 King, said, "Oh King, you should subdue, subdue

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:06.000
 your own mind, and that will bring everything, peace, and happiness.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:13.120
 Because mind is the root of everything. Everything. And for that reason, also what,

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:18.880
 in the Buddha teaching set, if we subdue the mind, then all those unwanted

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:23.200
 things that we don't want, is completely naturally dissolved.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:28.480
 Naturally dissolved. And then mind is, goes to the front of

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:32.720
 everything. Every activity we do is mind.

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:36.480
 So mind is the really rule, mind is so important.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:41.120
 Therefore, the practice of the meditation and working with mind

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:44.720
 is the most powerful, important that we can do

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:50.560
 in these lives, that we can. Also this, what we develop with mind,

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:56.960
 is not going to stay behind as a voice, as a body, when we depart

00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:01.520
 from this world. It comes, according to Buddhism, it will

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:06.240
 come with you. Mind is always with you. Therefore,

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:10.960
 whatever we develop with mind, it really will continue. It will

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:14.560
 develop, it will benefit.

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:23.600
 So those are analyzing in the more relative levels, how the mind is,

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:28.800
 in a, like, in, in how important is mind, how is ruling is the mind,

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:32.080
 and how are the distinctions of the between bodies,

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:35.600
 mind, and now mind is completely kind of singled out.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:41.200
 We cannot single it out. First we see the mind is ruler of everything,

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:45.600
 or does everything, and then we single out the mind.

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:49.840
 Now the mind is none of those, what we think.

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:55.600
 It's not with, it's not the body, it's not with voice, it's not the voice.

00:14:55.600 --> 00:15:00.480
 Now mind. And now when we think, think of this mind,

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:07.280
 then we analyze the mind. Now that is, many of you know already,

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:14.160
 and those are known as then looking to the mind of the, it is the past,

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:21.360
 it is the present, and it is the future. You look to the mind.

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:24.800
 And it's what in the Tibetan, in the teaching said,

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:32.960
 "Chiongmi rosa," coming, if I talk that roughly, coming,

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:40.480
 existing, and destination. This is what we are now going to look to the mind,

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:44.480
 exactly how the mind is.

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:49.520
 And we are going to be establishing the mind as it is.

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:53.760
 We are going to try to behold the mind as it is,

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:58.800
 as great Master Maha Ramaji said here, "Look to the mind."

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:03.680
 We are going to establish the "Wu." That "Wu" is what it is.

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:07.280
 It's exactly as it is. Exactly as it is.

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:12.480
 We're going to "Wu" as it is. We're not going to "Wu"

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:18.480
 it's not as it is. Wrongly "Wu." That is not going to benefit us.

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:23.200
 Instead it's going to disturb us. So we're going to really

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:30.160
 find out exactly that "Wu." We're going to look to this mind

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:36.160
 and find out exactly as it is. Of course we know now, now kind of roughly

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:41.040
 understand mind is emptiness. But when you understand the mind is

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:44.640
 emptiness, what is that is known as in teaching?

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:49.760
 It's intellectual. That intellectual is a correct intellectual,

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:54.000
 but it's intellectual. Now we're going to go let

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.560
 further, further than intellectual, really going to see.

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:07.040
 Not just that I heard, I think, or I might be. That is not.

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:10.800
 We're going to establish the "Wu"

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:16.480
 called direct perception "Wu." "Wu" of the direct perception.

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:23.840
 But it's not the past, not the future. Right in the now we're going to establish

00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:29.680
 the "Wu" or nature of the mind as it is.

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:33.760
 That for that reason then we're going to put

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:38.240
 including now again an analytical, an analytical

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:45.120
 where mind is come from, or where mind was before.

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:50.400
 But most and more and where mind will be future, where mind

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:55.920
 future will be. Where is mind now?

00:17:55.920 --> 00:18:00.400
 Now. Or is in the teaching also more detail level,

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:07.520
 what the teaching said. See, where, where mind stayed, or where

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:14.400
 vast mind where it came from, and vast mind where it stayed, and vast

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:19.280
 mind where it went. So that both subject and

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:24.400
 object. Mind is like a subject and a place to stay, or coming from,

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:28.800
 coming from, and a place to stay, and where it went as like

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:34.160
 object. Analyze in three or six different ways.

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:41.360
 Where it stayed, where, where it come from, where it stayed,

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:45.360
 where it went. And what is past that mind?

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:50.000
 What is that who stayed that mind what one stayed that what is that mind,

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.240
 where that mind went. Kind of looking object level,

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:58.400
 analyze the subject level, and object level.

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:02.720
 So then you what you establish it. What do you find?

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:09.920
 Each time when we question that, it's emptiness, simple to tell

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:14.960
 emptiness or the speechless. There's nothing really to explain.

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:17.440
 Anything.

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:25.440
 And then the future, where mind, that future mind, where it's coming from,

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:30.480
 where it's going to stay, where it's going to go.

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:34.080
 And that mind, what that mind, where that mind,

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:36.960
 and where that go.

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:42.240
 So again six different ways in the future, subject and object level.

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:45.680
 Because why are you doing this? Why are my teaching mentioned?

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:49.600
 Because to make sure that that you really find

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:55.120
 exactly as it is. Your own intelligence or our own intelligence.

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:58.240
 You analyze that.

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:01.760
 We heard so many times, mind is emptiness,

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:09.040
 mind is speechless, mind is openness, mind is infinite. But now we are putting our

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:14.640
 own intelligence. We see them to find out as it is.

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:19.920
 So now we did past and the future. Now look to the present.

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:23.680
 Where this present mind is sitting or came from.

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:29.440
 Where is sitting now? Where this is going?

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:35.760
 And again subject and object level, object level.

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:43.920
 Now what we found? What really we can see? This is not, as I said, is believing.

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:49.120
 Buddha said, "I'm going to believe that." This is not just believing.

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:52.560
 And also not just going to be nice or I just going to

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:56.160
 kind of think that. We're finding out exactly as it is.

00:20:56.160 --> 00:21:00.480
 And this is, when we are still there, it also can be known as

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:05.840
 direct perception realization. Direct perception.

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:12.000
 It's right now. It's not the past. It's not the future. You're looking to

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:18.560
 your mind. Mind. When we look to this mind,

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:23.040
 by mind, all looking to the lookers.

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:28.240
 That always looks. So now we've got to find it.

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:31.600
 Then it's totally what we, what Buddha said.

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:35.360
 Exactly what Buddha said. When we aim at the getting,

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:41.120
 it's merging. This is merging. What the scripture said.

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:44.560
 When our women put it analytically, what we do

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:49.600
 is find, exactly as it, then there is nothing more to doubt.

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:53.280
 Nothing more to hesitate and really just be

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:58.320
 as it is. This is also known as what? The great master. When you point

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:03.280
 exactly as it is, great master, Garab Dorni said, pointing out

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:08.240
 exactly as it is. Pointing out, exactly as it,

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:15.200
 or introducing and pointing out, exactly as it is, is your own,

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:20.880
 our own inner nature. This nature, what we're talking about, is not talking

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:25.760
 about someone else. We're talking each of us, our own mind.

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:30.560
 We discover exactly what as it is.

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:38.800
 As it is pointing out of the discovery. It is our inner nature by our self.

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:45.200
 It is own status. It is own, it is own status.

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:48.720
 This is known as then, what also teaching said,

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:56.240
 as still making the voo. This is voo now, voo. This voo,

00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:03.440
 when we meditating, what we meditating? We are maintaining that voo.

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:07.120
 Meditation is not something different than the voo.

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:12.640
 Therefore, what's called union of the voo and meditation.

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:18.720
 Comment together, exactly as it is. What you voo, that you're maintaining.

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:26.720
 You're keeping up that. That is. So, now you discover.

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:32.000
 We find out, mind is emptiness.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:38.640
 Mind is emptiness, and emptiness is energy, or the

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:44.240
 subcontainers are inherent. Exhales. Even those subcontainers

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:47.360
 arise in energy.
