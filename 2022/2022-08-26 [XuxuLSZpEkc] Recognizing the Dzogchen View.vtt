00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.360
 "Khandra" and then achieve the result. Highlight that now. Highlight that now. That's good for

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.600
 all of us. Of course, you all know this. You all know this. It's not something I'm talking

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:23.440
 new things. But since we are looking at retreat and looking at the practice of this, so it

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:32.520
 was maybe let me remind you to continue the practice of this week and then continue after

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:45.240
 the weeks. The quote is to recognize the view. Recognize the view is so important. It's foundation.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:55.000
 And what in the teaching said, "Yeh tawah moontu" in Tibetan. Recognizing or identifying the

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:04.200
 view, which is a foundation. What means foundation? View is foundation of our meditation. View

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:14.880
 is foundation of our conduct. And view is dependent of our achieved result.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:31.360
 So that means result and conduct and meditation all depended upon view. View. If view is the

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:40.520
 mixed, then you will mix the meditation, it will mix up, mixed up, not mixed up, mixed up the

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:52.680
 meditation. It will mix up the conduct, it will mix up the result. Therefore, view is so, so

00:01:52.680 --> 00:02:03.640
 important. Therefore, it's called foundation. In this way, yeh tawah moontu. Recognizing view

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:14.800
 or identifying the view of the, which is foundation. Once you have the view found, then we have

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:29.680
 meditation. Meditation is nothing but maintaining the view. Conduct is nothing but improving the

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:38.560
 meditation. And then if we are not mixed up our view, if we are not mixed up our meditation,

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:47.560
 if we are not mixed up our conduct, then we don't have to worry not going to achieve the result.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:03:03.520
 Result comes. Natural and free. Open comes. So therefore, view is so, so important. Number one.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:13.840
 And now, view, what that view? In the teaching, generally they say, they say the analytic view,

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:22.600
 establish or discover the view with analytics and through all, discover the view through the simple

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:33.680
 technique of the beat instructions. And this time, most of the time, we really following, establish

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:34.200
 or

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.680
 discover the view with the simple, linear instructions. That's what we're trying to do,

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:47.040
 that's what we're trying to do. Analytic we mean, study, all the further teachings. And

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.640
 particularly,

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:55.760
 zokki teaching or particularly those philosophical teaching, mademaka teachings, panjaparamada

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:06.200
 teachings. Those how explain the view? Clearly, very strongly, with logically, with the reasons,

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:12.640
 with the analytically explaining. Once you started those analytically and started,

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:19.960
 then you put that contemplation. Contemplate means the analytic, you put the analyzer,

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:28.760
 your own intelligence or our own intelligence. And mind is really kind of like dividing in this,

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:39.880
 discover and discriminate and finding out exactly where the teaching sit and is brewing that. So

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:47.360
 that is analytic way. And to do that, and we don't have any times and those, we like to be easy

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.960
 approach,

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:58.280
 easy, quick methods. So quick method is then the beat instructions. Beat instructions, those are

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:10.120
 what in the teaching sit. Three, three accurate is or that in it to be the chima. So, lama mega

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:19.040
 chima, and danga chima, rengar bachen. Those are chima in the tibetal word, which means that the

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:31.760
 accurate or the true, maybe chima is, I think, maybe accurate. I'm just going to translate it.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:44.200
 If I call nice kind of better word, I will let you know that in this way. I agree. Or maybe not

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:54.400
 properly this way. Qualified lineage masters, qualified instructions, and then, and not qualify

00:05:54.400 --> 00:06:01.680
 this, and then accurate realizations, maybe these things. So qualified lineage instruction, that

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:10.400
 means, again, lineage instruction is so important. Lineage, because lineage means that every, those

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:19.270
 great practitioners kept the teaching exactly as it is without spoil by the intellectual, skeptical

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:19.840
,

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:27.480
 and kind of their own analytical, change the word, this and that thing, and not mix. Authentic

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:35.640
 teaching as is uttered, uttered, or told by the samad-badra, vajya-sattva, or buddha-shaktamuni,

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:44.080
 and garabdurga, and garabhamma-sambhava, and lungkipa, and that all came. Exactly that same thing,

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:52.560
 without changing, without the structure, without alternating that. That is known as the qualified

00:06:52.560 --> 00:07:01.080
 masters who keep our practitioners, not master, just not being one single person. Master, maybe all

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:08.000
 trying to master of the realization, master of our knowledge of that. So really kept that, with

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:08.880
 honor,

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:16.720
 with joy, with appreciation, not mixing our this, our want, with the oil. It feels this, I like

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:17.040
 this,

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:26.360
 this. Our feelings, our thought is not reliable. It changes. It's not just a, I'm talking that,

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:33.600
 how many total ideas change in our lives? In the sense beginning, we have the memories,

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:41.160
 until now, how many times changed? Really, so many times changed. Every day is changing. There's no

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:47.600
 accurate, there's nothing to rely. Every rely on that, in some kind of reasons of the worldly

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.080
 concern,

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:57.440
 of all some benefit, then we spoil it. We spoil the natural. Natural, that is not correct. That is

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:57.680
 not.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:06.640
 So therefore, authentic maktishins, tishins or lineage qualified tishins, and then the qualified

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:16.040
 lineage tishins, instructions, also authentic instructions that we received. Authentic is received.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:25.400
 As we received, then one's own intelligence, one's own mind put that and got it, got meaning on

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:25.560
 that.

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:36.760
 That is called rengarupatshema. Rengarupatshema, our own knowledge, really proved. That is,

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:47.600
 that is a simple technique that does go on the wheel, wheel with stomach. How they do that? That

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:53.360
 is then in this teaching explaining, on the teaching explaining, and we all received that so many

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:53.600
 times,

00:08:53.600 --> 00:09:00.400
 this is Toki teaching. We are not going to go the outskirts of the, to astellics, from the

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:07.840
 outskirts gradually coming to the center. We are going to go the center of the bolts are. That

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:08.160
 means

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:17.380
 what? Center of the bolts are of the universe or the wall is our own mind. Our own mind is a center

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:17.440
.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:27.720
 What that means? Everything what we see around, that is outer. The mind is the center. Your mind,

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:36.520
 each of our mind in the center. Center, it is essential. So discover the view from the mind.

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:49.120
 How that discover that? Those are then teaching mentioned. Where is mind? Simple to say. Where

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:57.080
 is mind? Those are said, where mind is coming? Where is mind? Where is mind going or where?

00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:08.360
 And when we look this fast, the person in the future, all three times are no answer. We become

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:21.240
 the answer less, speak less. That is will. Believe it or not, will is not something that we have to

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:31.800
 hold tangible. If we hold something tangible, we don't find the will. We don't find anything. We

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:40.200
 lead to the speak less states, like center of sky. Then we point. For that reason, great teacher,

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:48.920
 Buddha sit in the teaching. When you don't see anything, that is supremacy. When talking in the

00:10:48.920 --> 00:11:01.400
 view, you see the Supreme. You see the Supreme when you don't see. That means subject and object

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:11.400
 are merged. There's nothing. That's discovered the view from the instructions of the lineage

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:19.800
 teachings. And then we also prove that. That means our intelligence. We're talking this, we're not

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:28.600
 talking that it's methodologically or somewhere else. That we, our own intelligence proves there's

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:37.470
 nothing we can say about mind. We did not find. It's not something we did not find because we like

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:38.040
 to

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:47.000
 not find what I said. Or because we did not find because I like to be polite. That's not at all.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:54.040
 Really, we don't. It's true. That is you proving. That means each of us proved.

00:11:54.040 --> 00:12:05.160
 That's it. That is not just we proved. That's what Buddha said. That's when all those

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:16.200
 lineage masters, nagarjuna, 6th ornament of the jambudips. And all the 25 disciples.

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:22.840
 And all the great master of all the schools of the Kebedah Buddhism.

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:32.200
 They're so scholars. So intellectuals. They're thinkers. They're not just believers. Really.

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:40.280
 In modern time you can say they're all like the best physicists. The physicists that's discovered

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:50.200
 of the inner spaces. Not just externals. External, everything. They proved one after another. They

00:12:50.200 --> 00:13:00.520
 sealed one after another. It's true. There's nothing to find. That is reality. When we discover

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:00.840
 that

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:08.280
 all of us, then that's what we call samsara nirvana, big jobs. There's nothing really

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:15.400
 can be like anything. It's like we can hold. But yet everything is functioning. Everything,

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:21.480
 nothing is changed on the relative levels. That's the beauty, the magical disciplines.

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:33.400
 All of that. So that is, when we recognize that, then we keep up that. Those are in this teaching

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:41.960
 explaining. Keep up all the teachings. See, we keep up that teaching with all the relative levels

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:48.040
 and the actual level. This is the absolute level we're talking about. Now not finding all that.

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:54.680
 But relative level, everything, for that reason, great master what Telova said in the Arab.

00:13:54.680 --> 00:14:00.360
 Even you got the highest realizations, or realizations.

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:11.640
 Even the, no, I think this is maybe not in the Arab world. Of course, the Arab world says that, but

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:19.240
 as great master sara said that, even you got the highest realizations of the unborns, but

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:26.680
 never, never ignored the meritorious activities. What that means, six paramata practices.

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:35.400
 That even you got highest realizations, not ignoring. For that reason, for example, great

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:42.310
 master's teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni, he has highest realization in the Buddhism. There's nothing

00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:42.600
 higher

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:51.720
 than that. But he, how much he is humble, simple, following in the given teaching and explaining to

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:58.680
 the, guiding to the other students with good control, the good meditation. And Buddha himself

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:06.920
 doing the same thing. In the teaching, Buddha went to the city and with mong, and got the

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:14.920
 arms or the food, and returned back to the hermitage, hermitage, and cleaned the feet. That

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:24.800
 means bare feet. Buddha is walking on the ground with all the students. And come back, the hermit

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:25.160
age,

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:34.520
 wipe the feet, and then he meditated. He's meditated. Even though Buddha already enlightens it,

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:43.320
 but to show to us how important to maintain the meritorious activities and respect the relative

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:52.200
 levels. Those are really teachings. And then all those great master's, we read life stories,

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:58.760
 one after another, really. Even they got highest realization. That is what. So now, again,

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:10.920
 go back to the, to this. Suppose you recognize, recognize or identify of the will. That is,

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:17.800
 so that, I mean, I'm just, you all know, know this, but this is, again, should do this to,

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:23.160
 even you got the realization. Even you didn't completely settle on that will. But support of

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:30.200
 the meritorious activities, such as devotion, bodhicitta, all those so important. Really,

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:36.040
 devotion to the lineage, devotion to the teaching, devotion to Dharma, oh Buddha, Dharma, Sangha,

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:42.920
 is so important. And this is like that. Not just devotion, okay, but sizzling devotion in

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:51.480
 art and mind will bring the sizzling realization and achievements. That is, so not just a kind of

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:57.480
 this devotion is the extra things. No, it's so important that when you have the devotion that we,

00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:05.480
 we are settled on the ground, not wondering, we're not lingering, we're not just the unstable,

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:13.000
 shaky, we settle on the separate ground. Now we feel so joy and appreciate confidence and feel

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:19.640
 the richness of this. And then that's the devotion. Really appreciate it. Feel that from the heart.

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:29.800
 And then when you got that, then maintain the will is meditation. As I said earlier, you know,

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:37.800
 meditation is not any extra. Maintain the will. Those are in the teaching said,

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:47.160
 said we are some unshakable, not shaky body. So that means good postures when you meditate,

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:58.120
 particularly big time. Time not shaky, not wondering of our senses and then not shaky of our

00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:09.400
 awareness. Relax, calm and peaceful. Those are you keep maintain the will, keeping the will.

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:18.520
 Once you have maintained that will with that way and then the improve by the conduct.

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:27.240
 Conduct is not just on the side that on the distance. Conduct is right with the practitioners.

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:36.520
 Conduct will boost the realization, boost the achievements. If you don't keep the conduct,

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:43.160
 it will delay. It will mix up our meditation and our realizations. So therefore,

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:52.040
 conduct and the Dokki teaching, what is the best, the great master, I am not just saying,

00:18:52.040 --> 00:19:02.520
 really say self-liberating, self-liberating. That means to win any thought and the conception comes

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:02.600
,

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:08.200
 liberated. What that means? Let it go.

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:17.560
 And we don't let it go. That means we are holding. What we are holding? We are holding samsara.

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:24.440
 We are holding samsara, really. We are trying to hold that samsara. What that means, samsara,

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:32.760
 because what we have been told, what comes and told is a duality mind. Dualities. Dualities are

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:39.080
 connected with negative emotions, ignorance, attachment, anger, all may be beats of those,

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:46.760
 all different things. That is duality, attachment, or whatever. If we hold that,

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:54.760
 we are maintaining the samsara. We like to liberate the samsara. Liberate to what?

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:59.640
 In the Dokki teachings, I say that is dharma kaya or the three kaya states.

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:06.760
 So liberate it. Who is going to liberate it? Nobody else is going to liberate.

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:10.440
 What are the teachings? Self-liberating.

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:21.160
 It means to you or your mind. Well, let it go. Where it comes from? All those thoughts and feelings

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:21.160
.

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:29.960
 From mind. And who holds? By mind. Have you let it go? By mind. That's called self-liberating.

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:38.360
 And then, in order to do that, what did the teachings say? Mindfulness.

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:47.240
 Without too much effort, without too much forceful, relaxed atmosphere with mindfulness.

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:56.120
 Or sometimes the Dokki teachings, ultra-American, all in the natural mind, not with clinging and

00:20:56.120 --> 00:21:06.680
 grasping, keeping that flavor or that light in the meditation and relaxed, then we are really

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:12.360
 good practicing. They are calling the teachings. And we are able to maintain that. And the post

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:20.600
 meditation or along that, as I said, both each other, siddling, devote, and siddling both each

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:28.280
 other. Even during the meditation, meditation of Dokki, bring up sizzling devotion, sizzling

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:34.560
 both each other for a few seconds or a few minutes. And then let it go. Not lingering that again.

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:35.000
 Even

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:42.120
 it's devotion, even in the body and not, let it linger on that. Let it go, relaxing again, saying

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:52.200
 nature. Nature says the mind. Those are the essence, heart, center column of the Dokki meditation

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:58.520
 that you all know, I just said the mind. Now we go back to the again, to this teaching.

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:03.960
 The teaching of this, again, is don't you remember? How many of you already know? Don't you

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:04.440
 remember?
