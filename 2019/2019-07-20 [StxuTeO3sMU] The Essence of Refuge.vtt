00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.170
 The essence of refuge is confidence, faith, and devotion, closeness feeling toward the Buddha,

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:12.000
 Dharma, and Sangha.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 That is foundation. Foundation of all the vows and all the practices.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 If we don't have that, we linger, we shake, we tumble.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 Therefore, rafu is soul and body. Generate that.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 So, with this understanding, now we return to home with rafu, Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:52.320
 Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha are known as another terminology in Vajrayana teaching, and particularly

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.000
 in Tantra, used as three routes.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:04.470
 Guru, Deva, Dakini. And how that equivalent comes, or how that can compare with Buddha, Dharma, and

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.000
 Sangha.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 Guru is like Buddha, and Yidam is like Dharma, and Dakini, and Dharma as Sangha members.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:25.620
 That is how she teaches. So, even though it's a different terminology, but reality is Buddha,

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.000
 Dharma, and Sangha.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:36.620
 So, you take rafu into that. And now, here it begins, we go to this new prayer. We go to this sadh

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.000
ana, the very essence.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:47.350
 And this teaching, again, as I said yesterday, or today, this teaching is generally inner Tantra

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.000
 teaching.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.820
 This sadhana is connected to inner Tantra, and again, inner Tantra, there's Mahayoga, Anu-Yoga, Aht

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.000
i-Yoga teaching.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 This is the essence of the three inner Tantras.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 Tantra starts with Mahayoga. That is what it is.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.720
 So, this prayer, or the prayer of the rafu in bodhicitta, developed in bodhicitta begins with the

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.000
 syllable "homes".

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 Home. Home is a very cigarette symbol, cigarette syllabus, or cigarette letters.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 Letters, it is symbolizing our own awareness, our own awareness.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.380
 And our own awareness is what really is beyond the level of all this rafu, all three duos, all

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:50.000
 three rules, is a rising display of the one's own awareness.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:58.730
 The display of the one's own awareness. So, relaxing our mind, instead of the zogchin, we join the

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:59.000
 home.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.420
 And relaxing that, then we're going to develop this beautiful motivation with full of joy, and dev

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:15.000
otions, confidence, and a relaxing, mongoling with our inner natures.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 Here, what I said, the three, the three rules are in bodhicitta, all of the rafus.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 The three rules are, and I think already I said, and you know that, but three rules.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 Guru, dehra, rakini, or dharmapala are known as three rules.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 What means three rules? You say that the root of the blessing is guru.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:52.320
 The root of accomplishment is deities, and the root of the whole performing activity is dakini and

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.000
 dharmapalas.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:02.730
 So that's what I said. Again, we should not think of the three individuals, and each has that power

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.000
 or the ability.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:12.250
 Otherwise, there's high light, we call it. Otherwise, guru in bodhicitta is the root, yedam or the

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.000
 deity in bodhicitta is the root, and dakini in bodhicitta is the root.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 This is not completely separated, isolated items.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 This all has all. That's the beauty of the true nature of the awareness.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 So here, and now, so with this, and three rules, in bodhicitta, all of the three rafus.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:52.210
 That three rules, where that three rules are, and here, and the spontaneously three guides, I check

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.000
 rafus by recognizing these.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 Sorry, the three rules, and then I check rafus also in three guides.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 Three guides. That three guides is dharmakaya, sambokaya, and nirmakaya.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 So I check that. Three guides, sorry, three rules, and three guides, I check rafus.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 Rafus. Now, what is the distinction between three guides and three rules?

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:32.390
 Even though, again, it's like here, I mean, it's not just here, it's the teaching method, the three

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:33.000
 rules, and the three kayas.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 The reality level is all same states.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:45.560
 And again, what is three kaya? Have you said if three kayas are connected with three rules, what is

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.000
 that three kaya?

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:55.000
 Let's say, again, the dharmakaya is guru, or guru is dharmakaya.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 Yedam, or the deities are sambokayas, and Rakini is other dharmakayas.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 So that way, it's connected, the same thing.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 And again, what is dharmakaya?

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 So where that three kaya and the three rules are, that is here, same.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 Sapantenously inherited, sapantenously inherited.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:37.190
 Where is he inherited? That three kaya, three rules are all within the awareness, one's own

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:39.000
 awareness.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 So that means, one's own awareness is represented by the syllable "homes".

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 So within the syllable "home", the three kayas are there, and the three rules are the same.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 And what that "home" is our own awareness.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:05.000
 Where is our awareness? Is it right? A coordinate teaching? Right? Center of our heart.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 How that exists, how is it there, in which man is beyond the conceptions, beyond the component?

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 It's uncomfortably, it's unconception.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 Therefore, the awareness is continuing.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 Our awareness, from the beginner's time, is until now the same.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000
 It has all qualities of the enlightenment.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:47.180
 It also, if we use the wrong way, it brings all those variety displays of the satsara delusions,

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:48.000
 illusions.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 And all the emotions, unhealthy emotions, because we pollute, we must handle it.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:07.730
 And then, of course, it has all those beautifuls, love, compassion, kindness, courage, commitment,

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:09.000
 understanding.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000
 Those all beautifuls are also within this awareness.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 Where they are in the awareness, beyond the concept, if we look at time, where is my compassion,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 where is my God, where is my kindness taught, where is my courage, where is my commitment?

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 Nothing we can find.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 Emerge to the infinite knowledge of our own nature. That's how it is.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 Similarly, our own negative emotions. Same thing.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 Even if it is bursting so strongly and making disturbance to the other,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 but if we look to the room, to souls, and if we try to find as tangible that emotion as to either,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000
 there's nothing.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:04.000
 It's like blowing air, if we use the example. It's nothing, it's there.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 That is how it is. But yet, our awareness is continuing. It's embodying when we're here.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:27.740
 The ultimate level is three kaya, three rules. So, there he says, "I take refuge, recognizing that

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:28.000
."

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:39.000
 Recognizing that means I've been joyfully, happily, and with great confidence,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 and recognizing and abiding in being that state, is the absolute taking refuge.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 Refuge taking absoluteness. When you take that way, refuge, there's no subject or object.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 All subject and object are merged. It is refuge of the beyond dualities, beyond the gracings.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 You relax. That is what is taking refuge. And how long are we going to take that refuge?

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 Until we fully discover that nature. From where? Where is that? From right now.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 And how are we going to maintain? Keep that.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:35.130
 In whatever situation, circumstances arise on the road, on path, or whatever. We are going to

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:37.000
 always keep that recognition.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:46.270
 Next, with courage and commitment, preserving that. And radiating that energy through the body of

00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:47.000
 others.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:56.730
 Love and compassion kindness, and respect and appreciation, following the according exactly where

00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:58.000
 things are.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:06.420
 Respect and appreciation of the way things are, a building in the related truth, and then be that m

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:10.000
ongol with absolute truth. Relax.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000
 That is what is known as taking refuge.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 Taking refuge, again, taking refuge, generally, but this is more like zukis, levels, but a way to

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.000
 get refuge, is that refuge in the Buddha, in the Dharma, in the Sangha.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:40.290
 And the Buddha is what? There are three kind of individuals. Buddha is totally in life beings, as

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:47.760
 you know, free from all obstacles, diseases, and all the headings, emotions, self-important thought

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:48.000
.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:56.000
 That is really one Buddha. And what is that Buddha? Love, kindness, compassion, all living beings.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 That is Buddhism.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.810
 There is just only one Buddha or how many Buddhas? There are many, many Buddhas. According to

00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:08.000
 Buddha's teaching, there are countless Buddhas.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:17.490
 Because all have the potential or the potential or the seed of the Buddha, whoever walked for that

00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:22.000
 seed, everyone can get enlightenment.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:32.090
 The Buddha who is not reserved by some selected groups is equally natural. That we, everyone walked

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:36.000
 for that, we can get. We can achieve that.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:44.100
 So therefore, there are so many Buddhas. According to the teaching, there is male Buddhas, female

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:47.000
 Buddhas. There are so many Buddhas.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:54.000
 So when we take generally Buddhas teaching, particularly Mahayana, we take it off into all of them,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 feel close, connect to all these Buddhas.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:09.850
 They are our great teachers. They are our role models. They are also, once upon a time, as regular

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:15.000
 sentient beings, emotional sentient beings, obscured sentient beings.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:25.050
 But they become the Buddha because they walk with heart, with confidence, with their own energy,

00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:31.530
 with love and compassion, with wisdom, all of which we can both each other, actualizing both each

00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:32.000
 other.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 We walk for that. Read the life story of the Buddha, Shakyamuni, before you become the Buddha.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 Those are known as jataka historians. It's beautiful historians.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:49.890
 One after another, how Buddha completely care and maintain. Even there is so much turbulence going

00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:58.000
 around that his love, his compassion, courage and commitment, caring and concerning for all beings.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:05.470
 That's what it is. As much as you do that, you revere your beautiful colleagues, and that is known

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:10.000
 as merit, gaining the merit.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:16.910
 And that means to gain the merit, it's put it by the obstacles. That's how the gracious teacher of

00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:22.000
 Buddha Shakyamuni once said that he is a part of women's according to the teaching.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:28.790
 This is not just only that, when we read those life story of the great masters. They are once upon

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:33.000
 a time, or the big enemy, they look like they are really normal individuals.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:40.950
 Just as regular individuals, as many of us. Like little, with full of emotion, full of sculptacles,

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:45.000
 worries, concerns, anxieties, and all those things.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:52.050
 Once they turn the mind, they have courage, they have commitment, they have the lowest loyalty to

00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:56.000
 the Dharma. They put that in action.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:05.170
 And even in some cases, no matter what happened, even the Rocky monkey falls down, or art tears

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:13.000
 away, and glory comes in my places, I am never going to move out of my practice, my achievements.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.840
 And even in that kind of statements, the men, that shows their courage, commitment, their

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.000
 willingness.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:28.810
 They are not just lingering this and that, jumping these grasshoppers. Truly they are. Really, that

00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:32.000
's what they mean. They are the winners.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:39.260
 One of them, in the Buddha's teachings, called Jyarbha, in it a bit. They were tourist monks. He is

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:45.000
 not done fighting with the emotions of someone, with his soul and that, "I am good, you are bad."

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:52.010
 Not that. They defeated the ego-clinging. They defeated the obstacles. They defeated anger, the

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:54.000
 jealous edibles.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 Their names are named as "voterismals" or "aranas". They defeated. This is what.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000
 And then Dharma is the message, generally, the message of the chief Buddha.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.000
 The message of love and kindness compare your thought to all the living beings.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:19.930
 And it shows exactly good quality to everyone, how to improve, how to bring your peace, happiness,

00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:24.000
 make something beautiful, beautiful to themselves, beautiful to others.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.790
 That is really Dharma. Dharma. And there is not just only one Dharma. As we talk, there is nine Y

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:32.000
ana Dharma's.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000
 Or not just only that. There is a variety of Dharma's. They call it a teaching.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:44.220
 So today, I take love for each. Close to all of these Dharma's. Dharma's. And that is a general

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:46.000
 again Buddha's teaching.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:54.540
 And the next one is the Sangha members. Sangha is a Sanskrit word in the Tibetan, known as Gendu. G

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:59.000
endu. G-e-d-u-n, Gendu.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:11.000
 Gendu means ghee is virtuous. Dhun means devoted. So, devoted is virtuous.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 That is really can be translated. Gendu. And then in the Sanskrit, Sangha.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 Sangha, Gendu. So, devoted virtues. What is their virtues?

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:31.000
 Virtues is their love, kindness, compassion, loving kindness. That is virtuous.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:42.160
 And courage and commitment, worship. All virtues is six bara matas. All two bodhicata. Viching, bod

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.000
hicata, absolute bodhicata.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:50.000
 Devote to that. So, that is really the Sangha members.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:58.200
 And then there is not just only few Sangha members. There is many Sangha members. Sangha members of

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.000

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:22.220
 So, beginning and turning the path, they are Sanghas. So, you reach to the middle of the Bhumis or

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:24.000
 the path, they are Sangha too.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 And the Sangha or to the end of the Bhumi energy path, they are also Sanghas.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:42.350
 No matter what your realization, achievement, but they are all Sangha because they are devoted to

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:44.000
 the virtues.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:55.000

 They are known as great body Sanghas and Mahasanghas. They are also Sangha members.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.310
 According to the teaching, they are already in like a base, but due to their completion, they

00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:19.000
 always act as like a great body Sangha.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.790

 Same thing, until we become the Buddha. We take that raffle.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.000
 And during that time, what is the situation of Sangha that has to happen?
