00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.720
 Tarsi Daleks, happy New Year from Holy Land of India. And we arrived safely in the beautiful and

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.000
 this incredible India.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:19.680
 And I wish you all my best wishes. Healthy, happy, joy, peace, lot of performance, with courage and

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.000
 commitment, confidence.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.020
 In the samsara we have always challenged difficulty and so therefore we need lot of courage,

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:35.000
 confidence, same time, with very very beautiful compassion.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:43.030
 And we really wish everyone have those beautiful qualities to everyone, everyone. And I pray for

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.000
 that reason.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.770
 And so all will become very beautiful and very nice and peaceful and so everyone will be enjoying

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.000
 the happiest and we will do prayers.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:03.740
 Our prayer is one of the best things we can do. And join our prayer with the old Buddha Dharmasand

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:08.000
as and then we pray, it will make some change in all.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 So we will do the prayer and we wish for that and again I'm going to pray.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 Tarsi Daleks, lot of Tarsi Daleks, Tibetan Royal Era. Tarsi Daleks. Thank you.
