00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.060
 This is one of our beautiful moments to be together and exploring the teaching of the Buddha and

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:15.530
 lineage masters and glorifying our connection to the Dharma and deepening our understanding of the

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.000
 meaning of the Dharma and meaning of our lives.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 We are truly blessed ones.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.700
 We follow the footsteps of these great masters in their honor, in their memories, in their presence

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:40.000
, and we continue to grow and glorify. It is wonderful. It is awesome. It is special. It is great.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.140
 I am very happy. I am honored. Again, be with you all, together, and then following the teachings

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:54.000
 of the Buddha, and glorifying Mahasamma and other great masters, and as we connected today.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.290
 So, it is wonderful. Again, I would like to say welcome everyone. It is beautiful to be together

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.000
 and following these teachings.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.200
 And then in this teaching, as you know, I am going to follow the teachings that are represented by

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.640
 our great teacher, the Kain Ching Pad Nishara Rinpoche, and a beautiful booklet, a book known as "

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.000
Turning the Golden" or "Nain Yanas" or "Golden Chair of Nain Yanas".

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.950
 And following that frame, in that context, in that understanding, then we follow the I follow the

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.000
 teaching. So, that is what we are going to do.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.930
 And now, first, I would like to talk about, again, this is one of the beautiful times we talk about

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.000
 and bring the understanding of the teachings.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 Generally, you know, in Buddhism, Buddhism, what do you call? Three Vistas. Three Vistas.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:03.080
 Three Vistas are known as the wisdom that comes from the starting, and the wisdom that comes from

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:12.000
 the contemplations or contemplating, and the wisdom that comes from meditation and practice.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:24.320
 There are three Vistas. These all we need three Vistas because, first time, we are saturated and

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:33.000
 overloaded and stained by the obscurations and negativities.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:44.710
 These obscurations and negativities is a dark force. It's darknesses. It's blocking our every

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:49.000
 directions and every of our movements.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 And that's what we do always with presumptions, hope and hope and hope. That's what we talk.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.040
 Because we don't have intelligence, we don't have enough Vistas that to penetrate or dispel that

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.000
 thoughts.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.980
 Therefore, these three Vistas are extremely important to guide our lives and lives of all the

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.000
 beings.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.600
 Our vision and the goal of Buddhism, in particular Mahayana, to be one ourself, to be a good person

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:28.000
. At the same time, we like to make good to others, make meaningful of our lives.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:35.480
 We are not going to waste the dragging and spoil our practice this moment in the precious

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:43.000
 opportunity that we are surrounded. We are kind of richest, richest of us.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:51.950
 And therefore, wisdom is so important. Therefore, to understand and explore these Vistas, what can

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.000
 great Masters lay out?

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.480
 All those great Masters practice. It's renowned in the Tibetan Buddhism, in particular the

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.000
 practicing lineage.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:10.350
 Lineage is very renowned, known as "Hedra" and "Drupda". "Hedra" and "Drupda", that you all heard

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.000
 that so many times.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:22.260
 "Hedra" means exploring the wisdom of the studying and the contemplations. The "Drupda" is

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:32.000
 exploring the wisdom through the practice and the meditations.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:41.270
 So this is renowned. Two things. Learning all those different teachings. But when you come to the

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:49.560
 practice, when I came to put that as our convenience, our usage, something like practical, that's

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.000
 called these two things. "Hedra" and "Drupda".

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:01.020
 "Drupda" we did. We did one-month retreat in Drupda, mainly focused on Drupda. Even though we

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:06.000
 started learning, learning is mainly represented by the Drupda.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:14.950
 One-month retreat, two-week retreat in the past this July, or in July we did. It mainly focused on

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:16.000
 Drupda.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.760
 What is the essence of the Drupda? The essence of the Drupda brings our self, the mind more gentle,

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:30.750
 more peaceful, more happy, more contentment, more soft, tender heart, with filled with love and joy

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:38.600
 and appreciation, respect and less grasping, less clinging and moving forward, not stuck with the

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.000
 past, holding on the past all the time.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:48.400
 And moving forward with bright vision, keeping continuing moving forward with bright vision. This

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.000
 is the essence of the Drupda. We did that.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:01.380
 This one-month retreat in the April and two-week retreat in the July, we did quite good. We all

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:08.000
 feel something that we did, good things, to benefit to our side, to benefit to the other beings.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:16.950
 And today, this time, we're mainly focusing on Drupda. That's what we call Drupda. Drupda is the

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:18.000
 essence of it.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:26.280
 That wisdom that comes from the study and wisdom that comes from the contemplators. So this time,

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:32.000
 mainly we're going to focus, study and contemplate on that.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:40.460
 This contemplative study, what Buddha taught that you've heard so many times, is called Buddha gave

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:48.000
 the teaching that you should put your input of the wisdom, intelligence.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:07:02.300
 Buddha used such beautiful examples as known as the goldsmith examining the authenticness of the

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:05.000
 gold, rubbing, cutting and burning.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 Those three ways that Buddha goldsmith examined the authenticness of the gold.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:28.510
 Similarly, then we study, we contemplate. Contemplating is, is then putting your input with that

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:34.000
 wisdom what you learned and made meaningful.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:42.570
 Let that absorb in heart, not just let it sit in again another kind of record. Record and let it go

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:43.000
.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 We're going to observe that what we learned in heart and then we're going to practice and meditate

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 and then bring the wisdom of the meditation and practices.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:05.300
 So therefore, this starting contemplation is the cheda. And the starting contemplation is putting

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:15.000
 our own intelligence through the knowledge that we learned from the study, study and remember that.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.130
 And then if there's something kind of like has doubt, does it discuss? That's not called the

00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:23.000
 discussing. That's the contemplation part of that.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:30.040
 You can contemplate yourself, you can contemplate with others and they support mad sense, mad

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:31.000
 meaning.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 So this is the really meaning of the cheda.
