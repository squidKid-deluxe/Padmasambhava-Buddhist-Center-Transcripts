00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.960
 Thank you very much. Today we continue to follow the teaching of the great teacher, Bodhisattva Kya

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:08.700
 Kya Mani.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:16.720
 This teaching is teaching on the morality, particularly on the morality, but also is mind, of

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:25.720
 course, concentration of the samadhi as well as the residence of the extraordinary training

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.000
 practices, explaining.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.850
 Why? It's called external ordinary practices. Generally there are many reasons, but one thing is in

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.000
 the Buddha's teaching, the Buddha's teaching is middle-way.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 Middle-way is not extreme on any side. So it is just the way that it is, the nature of it is.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:57.520
 So therefore, this teaching, the morality, is also teaching on that. Exactly, in the middle-way, it

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.000
 is not such a set of practices.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:08.390
 Neither is nor, kind of like very luxurious or kind of like falling in the car, nor in the luxuries

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.000
 or the laboratory status.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:19.020
 It's just middle-way. Therefore, it's also known as extraordinary teaching of the three different

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.000
 training practices.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.420
 And then concentration is also the same thing when we do concentration. It's not so forceful, nor

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.000
 so also loose. It's middle-way.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:39.210
 And the verse level is also not something any kind of exaggerating or kind of high-stating or low-

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.000
stating. Exactly the way things are, discovery.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 That's why it's called external ordinary training practices.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.770
 And it's also training with me that it trains our mind. It brings our mind more gentle and peaceful

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.000
, more calm and soothing,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 and more, kind of like, more with the common senses, more stable, down to the earth.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 That's what is known as extraordinary teaching. It's not anything else.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.470
 Besides those, just a basic simple nature with discovery, that's what the real nature is, and that

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.000
 is the practice itself.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.810
 And now, in order to again begin the practices, always in the teaching set, we reactivate our

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.000
 beautiful motivations.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 So in application, bodhicitta, and five perfect states.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.230
 Five perfect states are perfect teachers at the Buddha Chakra Money, perfect gratefulness to all

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.000
 the Sangha members of the Arathas,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 and teaching and so forth, time and places, and all that.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 So with those, Eddie told, we follow the teachings.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 Now, we are talking today, I think we are, yesterday we discussed about those five certainties,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 and as well as five, four obstacles, obstacles.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 And today we go to the, I think, basically to the, now, so all, everything is prepared.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 Everything is ready, this five certainty, I mean, it's in the teaching setting, five certainty,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:23.310
 but maybe in a more kind of initiative, language is suitable, five issues, the person that we have,

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.000
 five issues.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 That we like to keep, because this practice is known as practice, trying to make ourselves good.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 Good, and also good for everyone, and bring harmony and peace.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 If somehow we have those issues, then it won't really, we won't settle ourselves.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 Settling is so important, settling the spiritual attack.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 According to the teaching, we've been wandering in the samsara from the beginning times.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 We don't have any kind of destination or goal, we wandered all the time.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 We are roaming, roaming all the time.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 And now we're going to settle, spiritually settle.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.090
 We're not going to looking and searching and doing this and that, and too many thinking ideas and

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.000
 this and that, because settle.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 And we have these five issues, we're not settled.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 We're not settling, we're making our own ego-clinging choices, personal decisions.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 You're not completely 100% dedicated to improve with Buddha talk.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:40.510
 So therefore, then we won't dribble up what we'd like to be achieved, or what at least teaching

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:41.000
 says.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.140
 We won't dribble up that, we won't act like that, realization, understanding, because our ground is

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.000
 shaking.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 Oh, I like, I'm going to do only this time, or that time, or this situation, that situation.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 We're making all different kind of like, what's called it?

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 Biorities, kind of highlighting our own ego-clinging, habit patterns. Biorities.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 We've been doing that for a long time.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:17.540
 According to the various teachers, from the biggest times, we've been always educated by the force

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:23.000
 of our ego-clinging, self-important, and aware we like to do things.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.370
 But that, according to the teaching, we didn't fulfill anything. Still we were wondering,

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.000
 struggling in the samsara.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 Nothing really improved, actually, reality. Whatever we do, it is always getting, and headaches.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.880
 There's always headaches, one after another, uncomfortable, feeling and disappointment, one after

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.000
 another.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 This time, we like to change, we like to make the difference, difference.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 And kind of bring our habit patterns of the past, this and that thing.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.920
 Oh, I like to do that, I want this and that, and this and that, all things, we have to put on the

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:06.000
 side or let it go, let it go.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 And then also many times, we have kind of issues of our kind of, what's it called?

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:18.180
 When we are young times, young times, issues of what experience, this and that things, and bring in

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:24.000
 the spiritual, in the community, in the spiritual stages, and make that issues, what that does?

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.720
 It really spoils our own practice, and someday it's a failure to the community, to community, and

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.000
 spoiling that.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 And that is not the correct way to go. We like to improve.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 We like to, don't like to be struggling, what we habit patently, we are going there.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 We like to change.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.580
 And that's everybody, that's the one reason there is so many, for example, in a modern time,

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:54.000
 ancient time, such as old, there is assistance and support,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:03.490
 therapies, psychiatry, doctors, so forth, and also, we like to improve our issues, we have to

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:05.000
 follow those instructions.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 Whatever they say, those expertize.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 It's the same way, we like to improve the change and habit dependence.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 Improve ourself, from the grass root, not gross, conveyable, and hovering as this and that things.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 Now, come down to the ground, that's what we are.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 And from that, we build up.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 Let's change from that.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:38.000
 That is what then is it, five points, five issues, that free from the five issues.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 So that means we are totally dedicated, motivated.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 It's not just making blockage, these and that things.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 It's like that, we are free from five issues, or five points.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 So now we are leading.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
 And also, we don't have the poor obstacles.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 These poor obstacles are generally, according to teaching said, is changeable.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 At that time is necessary, during the Buddha's time, is necessary.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 Because everybody is making such big stories of that.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 But things change, then it becomes more simple, more common, more natural.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
 That we experience also in our own lifetimes.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 When we are young, or even 20 years ago, there are big issues, but different things, this and that.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 Now, it becomes more simplified, more natural, more common.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 This is nothing, the issue is just the same.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 Because this teaching is the teaching to help others, to ourselves and help others.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:51.000
 So if they make highlighted issues, that block in the helping, observing the teaching,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:59.000
 that's why the greatest teacher, Buddha pointed out those poor obstacles, poor obstacles.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 Obstacles, so free from poor obstacles.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
 Now, we take the ordinations.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 Ordinations is, when you take the ordinations, then there are ceremonies, of course.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
 There are ceremonies of the ruffled ceremony.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 There are ceremonies of the Norse monks.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 There are ceremonies of the Apasakas.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000
 There are ceremonies of the Gelumas, those Geluma or the Bidwan.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
 And there are ceremonies of the Orand monks or the nuns, fully or the nuns.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
 So you go one after another.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
 Follow the systems.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:43.000
 In order to do this, again, in here, the teacher says, you contract with qualified teachers.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 You qualify the teachers.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 Now you are ready to, in your side, qualify the two.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 That means we are free from the five points and poor obstacles.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:00.000
 You are perfectly, fully prepared and fully equipped or fully qualified.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:06.000
 Qualified teaching, qualified student or qualified receivers.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:13.280
 When you receive, this is what in the teaching always, qualified teacher, qualified student or the

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:14.000
 followers.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:21.000
 And we like to get that realization, have to be perfectly in kind of foundation of circumstances,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 perfectly.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 As should be.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000
 And that means the qualified student, qualified teacher.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 And we have these four, five points, the pre and four issues.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
 Pre, then you are qualified.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:43.000
 At that same time, that means also your mind is clear, your mind is pure,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 and you also, you know what you're doing.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000
 It's not somebody's towards you and put it in a block, block gate.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
 It's all your choice.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
 Generally, the Buddha teaching is your choice.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
 Absolutely your own choice.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 Nobody forcing, nobody pushing, nobody really kind of ready to do that.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
 But it's your choice.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 So you know all things, whatever is going to happen.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.000
 What do you think?

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
 You're inspired, and you feel good, and now you like to take that.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 Now you have to enter the path with all that.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000
 And that is from your side, or from our side, that will be followed.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 So we are ready.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000
 We know, we do things more clearly.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 And those are also issues, for example, those what in the Buddha teaching said, seven years.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 It's not just a physical.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 Also it's mental stabilization too.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
 Young as seven years.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
 So that means not just a physical in their world,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:53.000
 but mentally they also can be understanding, they can act, they can keep up that.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000
 That.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 So mentally and physically you are very qualified now.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 That you know that.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:11.000
 And then according also, for example, seven years, the shamanara, or the nuns or monks,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
 and that they have to be at least that in 20 years.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
 That is like fully ordained.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 This is also very, I think it's kind of, you know, I never thought that before,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 but it's same as in this country.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 Also they said when you are 21 years old, you are free from the like, in a way,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
 you are all independent and dependent.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 So you don't have to be, you are free in a way.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000
 And so you can do.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 So that means you are 20 years old now.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
 You are fully, fully ready.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
 Ready to resume your own decision, your own choice.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 So 20 years when you get that, you take the ordination.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000
 So all that aspect is completely kind of ready from the receiver side

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 or one who are going to receive the ordination.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 And from the teacher side, and the qualified teacher in the teaching said,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 and qualified teacher in the Buddha teaching,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 then in generally there's a lot of qualifications

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
 explained in the Buddha's teaching, Vinaya teaching, Sothra teaching,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
 and as well as in Vedaya in the teaching.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
 There's, I mean, you all know that.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 You all know that.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 But I will write that in the Vinaya teaching.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:27.000
 What did he say? Said, said, and that is.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:35.000
 And, and I'll just write in a, into bed.
