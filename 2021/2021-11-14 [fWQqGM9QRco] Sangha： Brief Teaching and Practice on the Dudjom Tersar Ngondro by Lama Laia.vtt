00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.220
 Welcome everyone who has come and is here and before we begin, as usual, connecting with

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:24.380
 our motivation more, our joy, our appreciation for this very sacred, fleeting moment with

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:31.900
 trust and faith in the inevitability of karma and with vast bodhichitta, thinking of all

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:41.740
 beings, that this time together can really be of great benefit. We can all be in this

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:52.500
 life and leave this life, leaving only just good fruits benefiting everyone and then connecting

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:04.380
 to with our purity vision and our awe and devotion and re-establishing kind of the view

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:15.340
 of all the great purity within the vastness of our mind, its clarity, its vastness, its

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:27.420
 all-pervading compassion that's just inseparable from everything. And then again with the great

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.820
 bodhichitta motivation that we can really have clear understanding of that and all beings

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:58.620
 can have that, which brings peace.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:19.300
 So we usually spend a little bit, maybe 15 or 20-so minutes just to reflect a little bit

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:30.340
 on the teachings we've heard and are practicing. And then we'll actually do our practice together.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:37.500
 So again, my knowledge is limited, our time is limited. I've said it before, I'll say

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:45.140
 it again, I'm here speaking a few reflections, but always, it's always a little daunting

00:02:45.140 --> 00:03:00.140
 and humbling. The Dharma is so vast, even just a glimpse. So each one, everyone here has

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:08.780
 heard the teachings, has great connections, has studied, reflected and practiced the teachings.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:16.940
 So of course, anything that I say, it's to the best of my abilities, but of course there's

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.700
 so much more and everyone has their own direct experience. So I'm just saying this, just

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:32.020
 trying to be good support and just keeping that in mind. We're all here for the practice

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:42.220
 and the teachings and it is so rich. And as we've been doing these nundra practices, as

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.060
 you all know, we've been kind of reflecting on things that can really help connect in

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:55.700
 a more authentic, simple, down to earth way with the teachings and the practice. So part

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:01.740
 of that has been also just kind of going through the different sections in the nundra. And

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:07.900
 so I've been kind of slowly going through the different sections of the nundra. Like

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.840
 we all know, there's the outer nundra, the four thoughts that turn the mind, which is

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:19.380
 always excellent, always important. Kempo Sewong Rinpoche says in one voice with all

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:27.140
 the lineage masters, really the power of reflecting on the four thoughts really sets our Dharma

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:35.380
 practice on a firm and reliable ground because it's really looking at really the facts of

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:45.340
 life and kind of brings that clarity, that warmth and moisture and appreciation to our

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:51.780
 heart. So we've talked about that before, but again I'll say that now. If you've never

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:57.980
 heard of the four thoughts, then you can find endless teachings on them. But most important

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:04.140
 is we reflect on them before we begin any practice or study. And this definitely has

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:10.420
 its own place in our nundra practice. And then doing that, we are turning our mind toward

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:19.540
 the Dharma and then we take refuge as the first section of the nundra practice. And

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:26.720
 then again, just as a quick review, we all know refuge is the gateway to all the Buddha's

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:35.580
 teachings and practices. No matter where, no matter which lineage of study and practice

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:44.300
 on this earth that are existing, they all come from the great teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:50.940
 And every one of those lineages entails refuge, which is what is just our basic trust and

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:58.980
 confidence in the Buddha, in the teachings of the Buddha and everyone who's maintaining

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:04.980
 and supporting, upholding, deepening their understanding for themselves and each other,

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:14.020
 the meaning and realization of the teachings, which is what is removing all our obscurations,

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:22.860
 bringing out our great clarity. We all have just limited vision right now, just tiny little

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:32.900
 like Rinpoche says, like looking through the hole, the size of a sesame seed at the universe.

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:41.260
 But that's just our current limitation. We're all opening to that. So turning our mind,

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:48.540
 having some connection with the Buddha, you know. So during our refuge practice, we're

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:56.740
 visualizing Guru Padmasambhava and all the lineage trees as the embodiment of the Three

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:03.140
 Jewels, Guru Padmasambhava as the embodiment of all the Buddhas of the three times of past,

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:18.460
 present, future, as the embodiment and realization of all the teachings and mandalas of the deities

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:25.220
 and the embodiment of all the Sangha. And so this is so rich on so many different levels.

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:32.300
 So we've been kind of slowly, very tiny again within our limited time, just reflecting on

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:38.560
 what is a Buddha, what are the different aspects of Buddha. And that's the last time I spoke

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.620
 at least was a little bit on the Dharma. And then Mama Draupa gave wonderful talk last

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:52.380
 week really going through the different aspects of Dharma teachings and view. And then so

00:07:52.380 --> 00:08:03.900
 now where that kind of puts us at Sangha to just reflect upon a little bit. So from now

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:18.220
 until attaining the heart of enlightenment, I take refuge in the Lama, the Three Jewels.

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:24.100
 So when we're taking refuge in the Sangha, I mean, on the most outer level, the Sangha

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:36.040
 is everyone who's trying to take the Buddhist teachings to heart. So that means both those

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:46.900
 who've really realized those great teachings and those who are on the way. So within Sangha

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:53.860
 there's two basic groupings of Sangha. There's ordinary Sangha, such as like myself, someone

00:08:53.860 --> 00:09:01.020
 who aspires to realize the teachings and bring them all more into my direct realization for

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:10.420
 the benefit of everyone everywhere. And then there's the Noble Sangha, those great beings

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:19.220
 who've actually realized it. So that would be who, the our hearts, those who've realized

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:33.580
 selflessness, all the bodhisattvas who are going through all the Bhumis, all the Buddhas,

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:42.340
 all the fully awakened ones. When the Buddhas are our Sangha, the bodhisattvas are our Sangha,

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:48.580
 the our hearts are our Sangha, we have the Sangha we can experience here in this world

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:54.660
 and have the great fortune to meet through these great realization beings, such as Kenpo

00:09:54.660 --> 00:10:02.700
 Sewon Dondel Rinpoche, Kinchin Paulden Rinpoche, His Holiness Dudrim Rinpoche, so many. And

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:12.220
 how fortunate. And the Sangha goes all the way right to the Buddha without Sangha on

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:21.100
 the outer level. We wouldn't have the teachings. Just like it goes back to just that's part

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:30.990
 of our, the great wealth that we have as practitioners within, you know, our endowments and

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:32.100
 freedoms.

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:39.980
 The Buddha appeared in this world, the teachings remain and those who are kind, who share them

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:46.820
 and support each other to the best of their abilities. So it's kind of, again, just like

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:53.340
 all Dharma kind of obvious, but just how beautiful to see that and highlight that, that we really

00:10:53.340 --> 00:11:05.660
 are connected to an unbroken living lineage, unbroken all the way back to Buddha Shakyamuni

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:12.780
 and through Buddha Shakyamuni throughout all beyond the three times to the pure essence

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:24.900
 of wisdom and compassion shining brightly and unimpededly. And it's due to that joy, devotion,

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:35.500
 courage and commitment of each one of those practitioners that came from, you know, India,

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:42.420
 throughout India into Tibet, circulating into that coming out into the world, meeting us

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:58.220
 in this life. So we too are Sangha. And so that's kind of on one outer level of remembering

00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:06.980
 that. And then kind of looking at what are the word meanings of Sangha? I think, you know,

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:19.340
 one thing I know Rinpoche has said in Sanskrit, the word Sangha, one meaning is inseparable.

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:34.020
 Just think for yourself kind of how beautiful. Inseparable. It's like our karma brings us

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:42.820
 together, our motivation brings us together, our practice brings us together. We're taking

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:50.860
 responsibility for our entire experience. It means we do have some trust in the inseparability

00:12:50.860 --> 00:13:02.620
 of the nature of our mind and its appearances. And then also then when the Sangha is translated

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:10.700
 into Tibetan, and that's this Tibetan word of Sangha is I think gendun. And literally

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:25.460
 what does that mean? It means those who aspire to virtue. So just remembering that as Sangha,

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:31.380
 we're all aspiring to virtue. And what is virtue? But essentially, I think we could

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:43.060
 say being authentic, being natural, being loving, being compassionate, being forgiving,

00:13:43.060 --> 00:14:01.220
 being open, trying to engage and practice all the six paramitas. And so we all know

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:09.260
 we're all here as Sangha. We can support each other. And that support comes mainly of course

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:17.260
 taking responsibility with how we meet our practice, both our formal practice as well

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:25.220
 as the practice of just being alive and with a mind with the freedoms and endowments and

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:38.540
 this precious opportunity. And then so keeping our joy, keeping our appreciation and also

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:43.180
 our courage and our commitment. Because as we all know, as Sangha, that doesn't always

00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:54.340
 mean we always agree or see things the same way. But we're still inseparable in one family

00:14:54.340 --> 00:15:02.420
 with the same vision, with the same goals, with the same values. So letting that really

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:09.300
 open up and purify and give some air and breath to any kind of misunderstandings we can have

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:15.620
 and reuse the opportunities we have and interacting, you know, to just kind of really take the

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:27.500
 Dharma to heart and really see directly the meaning. I think to then another aspect of

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:34.140
 inseparable and aspiring to virtue, kind of in that same line. Again, I think many of

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:41.700
 us have heard it, but again, good to remember. And Rinpoche said in the Guiagarbha Tantra,

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:51.860
 the way Sangha is really explained. I guess one point I'll step back and the Guiagarbha

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:59.300
 Tantra is kind of the source mother Tantra of all the inner Tantras and is especially

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:09.580
 showing in one way, just in general, how all outer appearances are the mandala of enlightenment,

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:19.980
 all forms, sounds, space. So within Sangha, it's kind of put out, there's what's called

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:27.980
 the distant Sangha. And what is that with our bodhichitta? That means every single living

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:35.820
 being is our Sangha. Is there to support our awakening? And they're here to support our

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:55.060
 awakening, all mother sentient beings. And then there's the inner Sangha, I think or

00:16:55.060 --> 00:17:04.940
 inner Sangha. And that would be on a more Buddhist sense, all the followers of the teachings

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:13.420
 of Buddha Shakyamuni. Or maybe one could even go a little further, all those who follow

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:25.100
 a path of love, kindness, non-violence, respect. Then there's the close Sangha. So again, like

00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:31.340
 we know within all Buddhist teachings and practices, there's many. There's Hinayana,

00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:38.420
 there are Vedan Sangha, there's Mahayana Sangha, there's Vajrayana Sangha. So again, here we

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:45.180
 are inseparable from all three yanas, all nine yanas, but we are Vajrayana practitioners,

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:53.300
 or at least aspiring for that. So that means the close Sangha are all the practitioners

00:17:53.300 --> 00:18:00.300
 and students of the Vajrayana. And then it gets even closer, within all the lineages

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:09.500
 and great masters of Vajrayana, there's the really intimate close Sangha. And that means

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:19.940
 all the Sangha members who share the same teachers, the same teacher. We've all received

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:32.980
 empowerment together. We've received the transmission together. We've received the same vows and

00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:40.700
 committed to the same vows and goals together. We've received the same instructions to take

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:50.660
 to heart and we're all practicing together. That's very close and very profound. And that's

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:59.340
 like if we look to just that even within Vajrayana, right, every 10th day and 25th day, every

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:10.620
 soak ceremony, where we always purify our mistakes. And so we have the, like in our root Samayas,

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:27.420
 what's the number one Samaya is respecting our root teacher. And then what's the third?

00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:36.620
 You know, the third Samaya, the closeness and the importance of maintaining harmony with

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:43.420
 all our Sangha sisters and brothers and purifying any misunderstandings or trouble that's come

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:52.180
 up through our mishandling and forgetting our bodhicitta and our view and etc, etc, etc.

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:58.180
 So that's, you know, profound because again, within the view, we're really taking responsibility

00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:14.980
 for everything. Everything is the practice. Everything is the purity mandala of enlightenment.

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:22.460
 So that's one angle of thought. And then to Kim Po Se Wong Rinpoche was so kind, so generous,

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:27.540
 has given so many teachings and continues to. And then he's so more recently given these

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:35.500
 teachings, the heart treasure to the fortunate ones and gone over for so such detail, these

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:44.940
 four everlasting wealths of the practitioners, of Dharma practitioners. And if we kind of

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:50.740
 recall to what Dajjalman Pashay is saying there, what are those is in that, again, remembering

00:20:50.740 --> 00:21:01.620
 the topic here is Sangha. So that's devotion to the root teacher. Again, again, we can

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:07.940
 be calling Guru Patmasambhava to mind, but also the great kindness ones who actually

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:14.660
 appear in our life, like in ways we can connect, but who are all embodied as Patmasambhava.

00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:23.060
 So, devotion to the root teacher. And then the second, love and affection for Samaya

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:31.620
 brothers and sisters. Really keeping that in our mind and heart in an authentic way,

00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:37.620
 you know, to the best of our abilities. And then again, bodhicitta and compassion for

00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:45.700
 all sentient beings. And then the fourth is connected, but it's again, one of these four

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:50.420
 wealths just to remember the full four, because again, these are pointed out. If we have these

00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:59.900
 things, we're incredibly wealthy. The fourth is kind of less grasping due to the fact we've

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:07.820
 actually contemplated how all compounded things are impermanent. So, for everlasting wealths,

00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:15.300
 devotion to the root teacher, love and affection for Samaya sisters and brothers, bodhicitta

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:31.020
 and compassion for all sentient beings, less grasping by contemplating impermanence. So,

00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:38.780
 as we are taking refuge, we're taking refuge in the Lama as embodiment of the three jewels

00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:45.620
 from now until we attain enlightenment. And that's the bond we keep with our teacher of

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:55.140
 this life and all of our Samaya brothers and sisters. So good to keep that open and clear

00:22:55.140 --> 00:23:12.700
 and honest and trust that because we really are together in this. I think another aspect

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:24.900
 of Sangha that's also helpful to reflect on is maybe on a little more related, but as

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:36.300
 far as with ourselves. Sangha in the sense of, if we think of, as we take refuge in the

00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:46.420
 true nature fully realized as Guru Padmasambhava, that's inseparable from our very nature, just

00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:58.980
 as it realized it. We're taking refuge in all the Dharmakaya Buddhas, all the Sambhogakaya

00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:09.020
 Buddhas, all the Nirmanakaya Buddhas. Here I've been mostly talking on Nirmanakaya level.

00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:15.220
 And again, just reflecting on Nirmanakaya, that's the emanation of wisdom and compassion.

00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:24.660
 That is how the Dharmakaya and Sambhogakaya is reaching out to all sentient beings whose

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:33.460
 vision is limited. So again, those can appear as Guru Padmasambhava, as our root teacher,

00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:40.100
 as the teachings, as the books, as the images, anything that's turning our mind toward the

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:46.260
 Dharma. And like we all know, as we take the Dharma more and more to our mind and heart

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:53.900
 and applying our meditation to the view and with our conduct, that means there's nothing

00:24:53.900 --> 00:25:08.240
 outside of the display of compassion and support. Guru Padmasambhava in other words is all-perv

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:10.340
ading.

00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:17.220
 If we take that, just awakenness and vividness, try to bring that to our mind and our heart

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:25.420
 as we're taking that, that trust and devotion and courage and commitment that we have in

00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:36.900
 all of our experience. And then also on the level of the inner level of our body, our

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:53.540
 channels, our winds, our essence element. Our body in a way is Sangha. Our winds are like

00:25:53.540 --> 00:26:07.540
 Dharma. Our essence element is like Buddha. And it's all, again, getting back to that

00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:15.860
 view of everything appearing in our heart, in our experience, as the display of compassion

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:22.180
 to support our awakening. That's also referring too to this other level. We talk, we don't

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:28.960
 say it in the prayer, from now until enlightenment I take refuge in the Lama, the three jewels.

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:34.060
 But then also again as Vajrayana practitioners, that means we're also taking refuge in the

00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:41.740
 three roots, which is just again another way of looking at the Buddha, Dharma, Sangha.

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:48.860
 And what are the three roots we've all, I think we all know? The root of all blessings

00:26:48.860 --> 00:27:05.980
 is the Lama. The root of all realization is the deity or the Yidam. The root of all enlightened

00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:14.820
 activity is the Dakini or root or source, source of all blessings, the Lama, which is

00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:23.770
 equal to the Buddha whose omniscience and power and abilities are completely unhindered, omniscient

00:27:23.770 --> 00:27:23.780
,

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:34.300
 and all-pervading as compassion shining out, reaching out, that the five wisdom's blazing

00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:51.420
 shining as all the mandalas of the deities, fully realized, fruition, is the source of

00:27:51.420 --> 00:28:00.780
 all realization, the Yidam, the Dharma, the source of all enlightened activity, the Dakini,

00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:13.300
 the outreaching energy of compassion and activity, all everything appearing, all forms are the

00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:23.940
 display of compassion inseparable from the great sky of emptiness. So just reflecting

00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:30.660
 on that a little as we're doing that and how it all comes back to Guru Padmasambhava whose

00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:38.860
 looking at us with such love, such compassion, such joy. And if we just think about it ourselves,

00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:48.700
 like if we have a friend or a child or a loved one that we truly love and value and we want

00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:55.740
 the best for them. We want their fulfillment, like if we really connect, if you just, we

00:28:55.740 --> 00:29:03.540
 do that, think of someone we love and adore and we really want to be happy. What does

00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:10.940
 that really mean on the deepest level? Of course, this temporary fulfillment and peace,

00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:19.380
 but like really that ultimate peace of removing our obscurations and bringing out our innate

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:25.900
 goodness qualities which are there from beginningless, beginning, just fully developed and

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:26.420
 completely

00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:33.980
 purified. That's what everyone who loves us wants for us and it's up for us to do that.

00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:38.620
 Just like those we love, they may be suffering or going through hard times and we can do

00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:47.700
 what we can, but it's up to them to find that peace. And of course, however we can support

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:54.700
 that, but also kind of bringing that as we're doing our prayer. Guru Padmasambhava is looking

00:29:54.700 --> 00:30:04.460
 at that with omniscient love, omniscient compassion, all-pervading. And it's up to us and our

00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:05.180
 devotion,

00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:16.020
 like they say, is the door, you know, receives the hook of compassion. Our devotion opens

00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:23.780
 the door to all the blessings, all the realizations and brings, you know, which we can take to

00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:32.260
 our practice, take to our mind and heart to develop that. And then hopefully we can, by

00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:39.460
 maturing that in ourselves, we can bring even more good benefit and support to others. So

00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:45.260
 maybe I will cease my little talking now and we can actually do our practice. So thank

00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:50.980
 you and forgive me for any unfinished lines of thought, but just trying to reach out a

00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:59.740
 little and bring thoughts on the Sangha, taking refuge in the Sangha together. So we'll just

00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:20.260
 sit for a moment and then we'll begin our practice.

00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:45.140
 "Om Ojinnu jinnu chan sam, ped ma gesar dum pola, yajinnu jinnu dukni, ped ma jyunni sesudak,

00:31:45.140 --> 00:32:00.340
 kodu kandro maim burkor, jijijesudaku ji, jinnji lokjeshe ksu sol, kudu ped ma siddi home,

00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:10.620
 samantabhadra, vadrasattva, promatavhadra, sri-singa, padmakara, 25 king and subjects, sozur, nubny

00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:10.940
ak,

00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:19.060
 one hundred tertons and others, lamas of kama and tourmalineages. To you I pray, inseparable.

00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:24.300
 In the past you were the Vidyadhara and in Dorjetsal. In the future you will be the Buddha

00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:31.900
 Mopataye. Now you are the regent of Padmasambhava, the actual presence of Dropan Lotsawa. Jijayashe

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:38.580
 Dorje. To you I pray, happy with little, content and rich in jewels of the three trainings,

00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:43.740
 with loving compassion, seeing all beings as parents. Through three-fold realization

00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:50.260
 you made three doors, three vatras. Virtuous monk, Pema Sotram, to you I pray. The supreme

00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:55.620
 tradition of the glorious Buddha, Padmasambhava, which is the essential, extraordinary view

00:32:55.620 --> 00:33:01.340
 and doctrine of the early translation school. You keep alive and spread by the light of

00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:07.100
 wisdom. Lord of Dharma, great kenpo, I pray at your lotus feet. In the palace of the ogman

00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:12.820
 Darmadhatu, the essence of all the Buddhas of the three times, the one who shows clearly

00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:19.180
 the Dharmakaya of my own mind, we pray to the honorable root guru, glorious root teacher,

00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:24.500
 precious one, dwelling on the lotus seat on the crown of my head. Hold me with your great

00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:31.420
 kindness and bestow the accomplishments of body, speech and mind.

00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:36.820
 And I'm sorry, I had just a couple more thoughts that are in line with everything we just did.

00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:48.980
 But again, Buddha Shakyamuni said, Guru Padmasambhava said, in relation to that devotion and

00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:49.580
 remembering

00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:57.500
 the noble Sangha, these are unimpeded beings. And Buddha Shakyamuni said, Guru Padmasambhava

00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:05.900
 said, just thinking of me with devotion, I'm there. And that's exactly what we're doing

00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:11.460
 with our practice. Feel the presence of Guru Padmasambhava, inseparable from all the Buddhas

00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:16.460
 and bodhisattvas and our own root teacher of this life.

00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:21.980
 And then also embodied in Guru Padmasambhava, when we're saying our lineage prayers, again,

00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:29.660
 this is all Sangha. This is that unending stream, golden chain of practitioners that's

00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:36.600
 come right into our own life and heart and practice. And then a few people have asked

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:43.500
 over time, too, in regard to the lineage prayers. We, of course, Samantabhadra, Vajrasattva,

00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:49.580
 Pramadavhadra, Sri Singha, this is kind of looking for prayer to all the lineage masters.

00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:55.220
 But here, too, the real heart of hearts that embodies the whole great perfection, all the

00:34:55.220 --> 00:35:02.380
 Buddhist teachings and lineages, but this great disoach of the, is coming down to us,

00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:11.180
 to Guru Padmasambhava, the 25 heart disciples, King Trisandetsan and all the subjects, Sozo

00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:17.220
 and Upnak, all the great, great ones at the time the Buddhist teachings came to Tibet

00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:23.140
 and helped carry that on in the early years. And all the Turtons, all the lineage masters

00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:30.300
 of our lineage were praying. And then we say this next four lines, we usually say, "In

00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:36.580
 the past, you were the Vidyadhara-nudindorjetsal. In the future, you will be the Buddha-mopataye.

00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:42.020
 Now you are the regent of Padmasambhava, the actual presence of Drogvan Latsawa. Jigjal

00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:50.160
 Yashidorjai, to you I pray." So some people have asked, "Who is this? Who are we talking

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:57.580
 about here?" We're talking about His Holiness, Dudur Rinpoche, is one of our great lineage

00:35:57.580 --> 00:36:06.260
 teachers who's very close. And then in particular here, people also have asked, "Who is the

00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:13.600
 Vidyadhara-nudindorjetsal?" So if I'm remembering correctly, I went and looked a little bit

00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:21.810
 at Rinpoche's teachings. But the Vidyadhara-nudindorjetsal was a great Vidyadhara in a whole

00:36:21.810 --> 00:36:22.660
 another

00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:32.580
 aeon, even outside of this fortunate aeon. And I'm forgetting, there was a Buddha at

00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:38.660
 that time, and forgive me, I'm forgetting that Buddha's name. And this was one who'd

00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:43.580
 realized that Buddha's teachings, the Vidyadhara-nudindorjetsal, and I think he was also a teacher

00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:53.620
 for a great king, Yookun Song, who had said had a thousand, or even a thousand and two

00:36:53.620 --> 00:37:05.500
 sons, princes. And that king had some degree of clear sight, and saw that all these sons

00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:13.980
 had great beautiful qualities, and would really be great protectors, and of great benefit

00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:20.380
 for beings. And again, this was in a Buddha's time, and an awakened culture of that Buddha's

00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:28.820
 teachings, taking them to heart. And so the king asked this Vidyadhara-nudindorjetsal, "Would

00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:40.820
 you please clarify more about what will be some of the after effects, or the benefits

00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:47.860
 and fruits of these beings? When and where they'd be the most benefit?" And so nudindorjetsal

00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:57.420
 did a big empowerment ceremony, and in part of that, he had a big fancy vase, and he put

00:37:57.420 --> 00:38:05.180
 the name of each one of the princes in the vase. And essentially what he foretold was

00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:13.460
 that each one of these sons would become a Buddha of this Aeon, which is a fortunate Aeon,

00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:18.060
 in which not just one Buddha, but a thousand Buddhas, or even a thousand and two Buddhas

00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:25.740
 appear. And as part of the empowerment was, during the empowerment ceremony, as each one

00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:35.380
 of the princes received at random from the vase, it foretold in that great harmony the

00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:44.950
 order in which they would take birth in this fortunate Aeon. So in that sense, the Vidyadhara-nud

00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:47.580
indorjetsal

00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:53.620
 is kind of known as because he gave this empowerment and foretold this. In a way, the father of

00:38:53.620 --> 00:39:02.100
 all the Buddhas of this fortunate Aeon and this nudindorjetsal, far along ago in another

00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:10.420
 Aeon, came into this world as dudur-nudindorjetsal. So that's why it's saying, "In the past, in

00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:16.060
 the future, you will be the Buddha Mopataye." So again, in this fortunate Aeon, where one

00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:25.020
 thousand Buddhas appear, Mopataye is said to be the final Buddha of this fortunate Aeon

00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:33.100
 before the end of this Aeon. And so dudur-nudindorjetsal is foretold to be the final Buddha of this

00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:41.180
 fortunate Aeon. And then now you are the regent of Patmasambhava. So dudur-nudindorjetsal was

00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:48.220
 known as the living regent of Patmasambhava in this time, and it was the presence of Draupin

00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:54.860
 Lhotzawa. And Draupin Lhotzawa was one of the twenty-five heart students of Patmasambhava

00:39:54.860 --> 00:40:00.860
 at the time the teachings were being established in Tibet. Jigdril Yeshedorje,

00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:08.940
 light of fearless, indestructible wisdom, you know, it's another name of dudur-nudindorjetsal.

00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:14.060
 So that's, in a nutshell, just a few people had asked about that. And again, kind of relating

00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:19.740
 back to Sangha and lineage, all the different directions, all these great supports are coming.

00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:25.490
 And then these next four lines, happy with little, content and rich in jewels of the three train

00:40:25.490 --> 00:40:25.740
ings,

00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:30.540
 with loving compassion, seeing all beings as parents, through threefold realization, you

00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:41.660
 made three doors, three vajras. Who's this? So this is actually a prayer to Lama Cime Namjal

00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:50.060
 Rinpoche, who was our great teacher. Many of us had the great fortune of meeting and being with.

00:40:50.620 --> 00:41:00.700
 This is Kenpo Selandongya Rinpoche and Kenchin Poldenshera Rinpoche's father, both Dharma father,

00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:07.180
 as well as physical father. And so this is a prayer to him. And Pima Tsutram was his

00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:15.820
 ordination name when after he became a monk. So anyway, and then the next prayer I think

00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:22.300
 we all know is to Kenchin Poldenshera Rinpoche. So I just wanted to clarify that. So thank

00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:30.780
 you for the extra time. So now in the presence of all these great ones, we'll continue. We'll go to

00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:47.900
 our calling the Lama from afar, which is page 18 in the nundra of sadhana.
