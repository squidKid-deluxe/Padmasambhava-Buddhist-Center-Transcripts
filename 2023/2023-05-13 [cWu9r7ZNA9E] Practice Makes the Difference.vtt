00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.590
 Thank you very much, everyone. Thank you for coming. Good morning, everyone, we are participating.

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:06.300
 Thank you.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:13.840
 Right now, it's the continuing of this, and I'm glad we're going to be completing these teachings.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:21.040
 This and the end, of course, we will reactivate a little bit more, but today, we're going to be

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.640
 completing this.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:28.860
 Our wonderful, beautiful hermitage retreat and attaching to the call of the teaching

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:34.140
 of the seemed teacher of the Buddha Chaturmani, of Gaurav Dorni, Mangekari Mehtara,

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.280
 Mangekari Samhara, and Gaurabhema Samhava, and all the lineage masters.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.940
 Here, a treasure we're really touching today, and we went through those, according to our best

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:47.760
 capabilities,

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:56.680
 with a joy and a devotion, love and a respect, and truly to preserve the teachings of these special

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:57.520
 teachings,

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:04.480
 not just the kind of affectionate and kind of like casually talking this, really truly like to

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.560
 observe to the heart and the mind.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:14.200
 We spent one month, almost one month, meditating and practicing, morning, we practiced,

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:21.160
 let it teach, all we do is practice, apranam, we practice. And this is what Buddha teachings say,

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.060
 generally they are true.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:30.920
 Upholding the lineage teaching of the standing and contemplating, that is our standing.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:37.580
 Learning, in a way, I'm teaching, talking that, I'm teaching, I'm not really qualified, great

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:38.120
 masters,

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:44.680
 but yet, I received some teachings, and also I honor, really, honor is not just kind of like

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:45.920
 talking that,

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:52.580
 just really deep down in the heart, I honor the lineage teachings, even though I don't have the

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.560
 realizations, but I honor that.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.360
 And so, I talk, and you listen, and contemplate, and studying that.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:11.350
 And then second, in the teaching, Buddha said, uphold the teaching by practicing, practicing, and

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.680
 get some realization.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.920
 This teaching in the tongue is hovering on the brain's intellectual.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.840
 Receive that teaching, receive this teaching, receive this and that, and we have many listeners,

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.280
 but how much really we observe?

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:38.370
 And also now, many of us in the mid-lives, I just say politely, I'm saying that, because we all

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.840
 know,

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:49.150
 I'm not going to explore the full moon of truth, so therefore, we end up with myths, and how many

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.040
 times we have.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:03:01.560
 Really, it's a perfect time, beautiful time, perfect situations, and a perfect kind of environment

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.080
 that we should practice.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:09.630
 We really practice so important, teachings. It is either teaching, but practice is so important,

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.280
 that makes the difference, difference.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.720
 And so therefore, we practice. You practice it more than me, in a way.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:25.160
 In the morning, you practice meditating. I'm really thankful. That's so wonderful. That's what we

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.040
 need.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:32.810
 In the afternoon, I come, too. And three days, I miss, but otherwise, I came and we practice. We

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:33.840
 toy with it.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.040
 We're in one boat. We're the sangha members, not something high in the lower, or this and that

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.720
 things.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.710
 And maybe you have more realization than me, but extended, I'm acting as a teacher, but yet, I

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:49.520
 really don't feel that I have higher realization than you.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:55.760
 And I need practice, too. I come after no one in practice. So we're in one boat.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:02.600
 So we toy with it and cross the ribbon of the dualities. That's what really we're doing, right?

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:08.580
 And it's just really wonderful. That is what we have to honor and observe, so we make some

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:14.760
 difference in the heart and the mind, not just on the list, that I did these, that, that things.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.590
 Really, something change. That's what the great master, I mean, all the master said, "Hissam dunyur

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.320
um," you say, too.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:27.980
 Practice means something that you observe, that you feel, that we're confident, particularly when

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:28.760
 we leave.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:35.310
 I'm not threatening, but we will leave. We'll leave. At that time, we leave something a little more

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.520
 joyfully, that are comfortable, that some bring you some confidence and destination.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:47.290
 That is the result of the practice, something to be fulfilling our practices. If we leave with the

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:54.160
 sad and suffering, disappointment, and deep praise, that is then the goal of the person.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:01.710
 It's not different. Same other beings, mostly people do, we're frightened and scared and all, just

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:08.760
 assembling it, then he, that's everybody does, unless something happens suddenly.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:15.020
 That's the normal. Practice means something with confidence. If we leave, that's what remains, by

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:21.800
 the practice, not just by the list of these and that things, or intellectual, all these things.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:28.460
 See, that is according to teaching, you see that. So we did practice, I'm very so thankful and

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.200
 grateful, all of you, really, all together, we did this.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:39.200
 And then all the women, support and help, can take in cooking and facility. I'm just really so kind

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:48.680
. And all of that great master, master of all, Malareva said, one who practice on the mountain, and

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:56.080
 one who is supported practice, they have the aspect of the connection, they will get enlightened,

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.840
 they all get enlightened.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:05.540
 So one who is supporting, making element, cooking and organizing, these other things, and one who

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:09.880
 is practicing, and we all target the practice, really.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:17.290
 This is what the teaching says. So, therefore, we all this practice, and now I'm going to go over

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:19.160
 these teachings.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.040
 Treatings on this, again, is--
