00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440
 And what is increasing? Increasing the merit, increasing the merit, accumulating merit, what's the

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.320
 merit?

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:15.220
 When the accumulation of merit and what's the merit, when we increase it, it will purify our obsc

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:16.000
urations,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:25.040
 negativities. And then, so to do that, what is in Vajrayana teaching, often we heard two stages,

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:31.440
 two stages, you heard. I mean, you know that in Vneh Pobano, every Vajrayana Buddhist

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:39.040
 practicing is always not two stages. Those two stages are creation stage of the visualization

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:49.720
 and completion stage of the dissolvings. These two stages are the principal practice of the Vajray

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:50.000
ana

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.960
 teaching and in the teaching also said is the principal. All the Buddha's teaching on the

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:05.520
 Vajrayana is best on these two stages. So what is that? The creation stage of the visualization is

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:13.520
 practicing on the relative truth and the practicing on the completion stage of the dissolving

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:21.040
 is absolute truth. And these are two truths. In the great Mahathma Nagarjuna said,

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:28.870
 whatever Buddha gives the teaching is best on the two truths, what are these two truths? Is it

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:29.280
 relative

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:36.560
 truths? Absolute truths. Those are two truths. In Vajrayana teaching, creation stage and

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:45.280
 the completion stages. Creation stage of the visualization and completion stage of the

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:53.270
 dissolvings. That's what I'm translating and many of you know that. And the creation stage means

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.680
 what?

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:03.760
 Creation. We are in a way created by mentally. Mentally creating. Is we creating that? We created

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:09.040
 that. Not just we're creating that, but we follow in the instructions of the great state of

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:16.400
 Buddha Shakyamuni or Buddha Vyajit Dara or Vyajit Sattva or great Buddha Shakyamuni or

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:23.280
 Murpaya Masambha. Their instructions and then we're creating mentally, publicating

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:30.080
 the meditation. That's called the creation stage. Then commonly in English it's called

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:37.440
 the visualizations. So you're visualizing something, but that is created by the mind.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:48.960
 Is a relative truth. And then the completion stage is what that means. Completing every duality

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:57.280
 or dissolving every duality, the conceptions, and then meditating. And that is the absolute truth.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:05.840
 Absolute truth. So these two stages. The fourth is in the Vyajit Dara teaching teach. The fourth

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:13.680
 stage, which is creation stages. So now these creation stages many of you all know. We visualize.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.960
 Whatever we do practice meditation in the Vyajit Dara teaching, most of the time we

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:27.200
 visualize. Possibly we visualize. And that is for example here. Here in this teaching when you look

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:35.600
 through here. In the footnote Vyajit Seven. Vyajit Seven. Instantly one's self and the deity in the

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:45.120
 front appeared clearly as Vyajit Dara and Guru Vyajit Masambha. In the form of the Buddha Amitayo.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:55.840
 Instantly appeared. So that means we propagate it by the mind. Here Anstokan said that you should

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:05.200
 instantly become the Guru Vyajit Masambha or the Buddha Amitayo. Inseparably we visualize. How

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:14.160
 that, how there we should appear. So our self becomes Guru Vyajit Masambha. And then Guru Vyajit

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:21.040
 Masambha mostly you all know the picture of the Guru Vyajit Masambha. We saw statue or tanga. And

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:28.080
 this time Guru Vyajit Masambha is, is that sometimes Guru Vyajit Masambha is in the right

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:36.960
 hand dojia that we're extending outside like this. Like this. And sometimes like tall heart center.

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:44.560
 Center. But this time tall heart center. Tall heart center. And the rest suggest the same. In the

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.960
 left

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:57.040
 hand Guru Vyajit Masambha holds skull cup. Skull cup and filled with nectar. Above that, above that

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:08.160
 nectar then there's long life. Life was V-A-S-E. And long life was, I think many of you saw the

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:14.880
 illustration. Long life was and that as beautiful also the kind of ornaments. Ornaments.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:25.360
 Now maybe we're wondering how that long, the skull cup is filled with nectar. And above that,

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:32.720
 that long life was, how can you see that it was deep inside the water nectar. Maybe you're thinking

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:32.800
,

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:39.040
 or maybe I'm thinking that. Maybe you don't think that. Maybe I'm thinking how that can

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:46.400
 dip that now. Maybe it's going to dip inside. But that whole Guru Vyajit Masambha's poem is

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:57.440
 rainbow body. That skull cup is rainbow. That vase is rainbow. That nectar is rainbow.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:08.240
 What that means is light. Guru Vyajit Masambha's body is light body. And that skull cup is light

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:22.320
 skull cup. That nectar is light. Light nectar. And that vase is nectar. Light vase. And all

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:22.880
 beautiful

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:29.600
 only the things, everything is light. What that light is, is the essence of the wisdom

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:38.800
 and the compassion appeared on those poems. And Guru Vyajit Masambha's poem is wisdom and

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:39.760
 compassion,

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:48.560
 essence. That's called rainbow body. Whole is the cloth of wearing the ornament. Everything is

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:58.320
 rainbow. Light. So when we visualize in Vrva Masambha or when we visualize the Buddha or the deity,

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:05.840
 we're not going to visualize a solid object, solid like bone and muscle and all these bone

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:13.920
 structures and all that. No. It's rainbow body. For that, you understand that realization of

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:22.080
 brain that, obtain a teaching mechanism, you meditate the poem as a reflection moon in the water.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:32.720
 All images on the marrow, in the marrow, we visualize. That is Guru Vyajit Masambha's body.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:43.360
 And all the Buddhas when we visualize, any Buddha, any wrath of deities that appears wrath of deity

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:43.360
,

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:49.680
 reality is love, compassion, wisdom that appeared in that form,

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:55.440
 ought to defeat the neurotic duality regiment conceptions.

00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:05.440
 Novelity regiment conception is always clinging, grasping. Even in neurotic mind,

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:17.040
 grasping, grasping itself is hallucination. It's self, self is the emptiness. There is no

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:25.680
 substantial solid existing neurotic mind. We did not find. Buddha did not find.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:36.800
 But a fixation is fixed with that. That's just the idea. That is the obscurations. That is blocking

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:46.080
 all our realization, understanding, progress, fixation, fixation. All is the mind.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:56.160
 Nothing. This time, very annotating is primus, breaking the duality concept, the fixation

00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:04.240
 instantly. Bring the ultimate freedom of the mind it is. Mind is freedom.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:14.000
 Mind is freedom. Mind is not restricted. That's why then we grasping, we clinging. We use the wrong

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:22.240
 way. We dilute it. We make the wrong, dilute it the wrong way. And then we suffer ourself

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:30.800
 by our own dilute, fixations. This time, we're breaking that. So we visualize

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:40.320
 as like that, rainbow body as it is. And then also we visualize on the front.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:48.320
 On right in our front, maybe eye level, little bit, not exactly as our level,

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:59.120
 but let a higher level end. Exactly same as right in front of us, we visualize. It's also transcend

00:09:59.120 --> 00:09:59.520
ental

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:06.560
 with no rainbow body of love and a compassion. Even though it's a rainbow body like that, as I said

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:06.560
,

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:12.640
 many times, also in the teaching mentioned, it is embodiment of all the Buddhas.

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:18.560
 Embodiment of all the enlightenment comes, triggered in one single state as that image,

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:27.680
 that forms. That is what we're going to see. We're going to embrace that, exactly that quality,

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:34.880
 with our courage and commitment, confidence, as I said early, without any doubt and hesitation,

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:44.080
 and the skeptical, intellectual ideas. We pick courage, embracing that quality. That's also called

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:54.480
 in the teaching mentioned, we are bright. We hold, we keep that, that, we stay family with that.

00:10:54.480 --> 00:11:00.960
 So with that thought, and Gurbam Masambha, which is right in front of us, us and the

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:04.920
 the Buddha Amitayana separately, and then we joined these prayers.
