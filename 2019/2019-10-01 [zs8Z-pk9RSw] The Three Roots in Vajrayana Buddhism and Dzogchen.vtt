00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.200
 Welcome, everyone. Again, we are strengthening our visual motivation of the dual and the abracation

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.380
.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.940
 At the same time, then vastness, motivation of the body.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:23.360
 And then, beauty, realization and understanding. Those are all activated, and then, we reflect

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.640
 again, teaching.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:31.280
 And then, teaching of Dzogchen by the great Master, His Holiness Dudjom Rinpoche.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.020
 Today, we're going to concolate, well, this morning, we're going to concolate this, we've completed

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.640
 now, very, very, and so on, uncompleted.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:52.930
 Now, you will note, again, the last three, His Holiness Law, and then it goes, and that is, which

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:59.180
 is, is, is, is there additional practices on the, His Holiness here, I like it.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:07.800
 And in the Vedayana practices, in the Tantra practices, always, imagine, like, pre-principled

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:15.160
 practices, those are known as Guru, Jeddam, and Dakinis.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:26.460
 Oh, Guru, Jeddis, and Dakini, again, practices, those are, those are, that can't encompass entirely

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.800
 teachings of the Vedayana or all the Tantra teachings.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:38.670
 Teachings are teachings on the Guru, teachings on the Diti, teachings on the Dakinis. So that is

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.400
 what, so it is very, very important.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:50.810
 And also, that is same as the Buddha, Dharma, Sanghas. Sangha, and Guru represents the Buddha, and

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:58.880
 the Diti represents Dharma, and Dakini represents Sanghas.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:05.680
 So that way, and His Holiness Nation, India, and the Gurus, as Guru, Guru Yoga practices, that is,

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.620
 I like it.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:20.170
 So here, at, here, last teaching here, said, he said, practicing by the Vedic Raya will remove the

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.720
 obstacles of these lives.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.940
 So that means, he removes the obstacles. What kind of obstacles?

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.920
 The obstacles are known as, the other day I make it, poor demons.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:46.320
 Demon of the emotions, demon of the aggregate, demon of the death, demon of the distractions.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:57.000
 Poor demon, demon of the pleasures. That, poor, it will destroy, it will remove.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.390
 When you remove those poor demons, what we are going to achieve? We are going to achieve Buddhahood

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.840
, or we are going to discover our innate nature.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:15.700
 Jockey nature, exactly as it is. So it will proliferate. This is also a practice of these Vedic Ray

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.080
a practices, as well as Chhuma.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:25.000
 Next one is Chhuma. This practice is a particular, also a practice that this, His Holiness gave

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.360
 this particular teaching through the monk Ishirabsa.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:36.040
 Ishirabsa, that is him, which is mentioned here, here, here, and so, he is also a part of the

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.680
 practice.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:46.080
 That's why he is encouraging to keep, control of those practices, along with Jockey practices.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:04:05.140
 Here, this Ishirabsa is translated, then, here, Ishirabsa. So really, this is what Ishirabsa has,

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.960
 his personal practices.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:17.370
 Guru practices, and Yadav practice as Vedyakala here, and Chhuma, all here, how he is only

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.760
 translated here, great mother Chhuma.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:28.570
 That was his practices. And in the Dharmapala, Mahakala, he practices, but that is just a principle

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:34.920
, highlight of Dharmapala, along with the Bhamma Ekachati and other Dharmapala practices.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:43.990
 So that's what, here, he liked that. So now I'm making really about the obstacles. Obstacles, these

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.720
 four demons.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:53.300
 Demon, the obstacle, or the demon, is not something that many individual will be thinking, is

00:04:53.300 --> 00:05:00.360
 something outside, standing and strangely looking, that is making obstacles.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:09.080
 Maybe there is some invisible things like that, could be, but the most powerful, the most powerful,

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.640
 and the strong, making trouble all the time.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:23.500
 That means, throughout the lifetimes, that obstacle, that demon, that four demon, what are measured

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.280
, measured, and demon of the negative emotions.

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:35.320
 That started, negative emotion is gross level. Negative emotions, what are those negative emotions?

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:42.950
 Those again, gracious teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni, metaphor to explain over this how that there were

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:53.720
 fours, three fours, five fours, and those three fours are ignorance, attachment, anger.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:06:05.870
 That ignorance is demon. Attachment is demon. Anger is demon. Then it took it with the combination

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:14.040
 of that is multiplying negative emotions, known as arrogance, is demon.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:21.680
 Jealous is demon. Then the combination of those five things, there is so many negative emotions,

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:28.200
 igniting that one after another. There are the demons.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:39.200
 And where it started? Again, demon of grasping, demon of ego cling. Those are the biggest, the most

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:44.680
 powerful, and the continuing trouble matters.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:53.080
 That means, all the lifetimes, it's not just once in a while, or occasionally making trouble.

00:06:53.080 --> 00:07:02.490
 Constantly making troubles, troubles of the happiness, peace, and joy in the samsara, troubles to

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:06.920
 achieve the Buddhahood, or permanent enlightenment.

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:17.400
 They block the room. So that is tea. Then aggregates, aggregates are generally all the five aggreg

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:25.600
ates. They are every skillfully used in these aggregates, they are weaker, weaker to get

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.920
 enlightenment or to benefit the others.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:37.160
 But most of the time, we don't use, or we sentence based don't use, we misused, misusing our

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.920
 aggregate, our precious human lives.

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:49.390
 We misused, creating more difficulty in troubles, to ourselves, to others. It's nothing is enough

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:50.920
 for the aggregates.

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:58.920
 Whatever we do, it's always something. Goes on and on. Goes on and on.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:05.210
 And then because we get so many negative emotions, or activated negative emotions, trying to make a

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:07.920
 place to help the aggregates.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:17.130
 We do so many times. Therefore, also the creative teacher, Buddha name, they are tabomak, if we don

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:20.920
't use right way. So it's like demon.

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:28.560
 Then because we love ourselves so much, we care so much our dear ones and our loved ones, but it's

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.920
 not going to stay like that.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:39.920
 Death, demon of death is going to disturb. Continue, it's disturbing.

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:47.000
 It disturbs all the harmony, the peace, enjoyment, little bit cut with a window of light in the s

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:47.920
amsara.

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:56.600
 It smashes, tugged with it and it brings all that, not just that Kim, there's sickness and troubles

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:57.920
, all that Kim.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:04.920
 Come back in his brain like horizons. It brings all different things and then boom, that happens.

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:11.980
 So therefore, it is trouble matter. It is a trouble. If we don't use the right way, it matches

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:12.920
 trouble.

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:18.560
 For that reason, what did the teaching say? Like we don't use the right way of our precious life or

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:19.920
 the aggregate.

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:29.920
 It is ragging down us through the heavies that come, that if you really drag us off, all the time,

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:34.920
 not just happen once and why, but constantly it does.

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:40.920
 Again, we must use it. Unscarefully, we can't relate.

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:48.920
 Spend time with the aggregates and spoil. That's what it's called.

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:54.920
 Then everything is quite okay and good. Then the demon of the pleasures.

00:09:54.920 --> 00:10:01.920
 We are so attached, we are so clingy to all the pleasures, objects of the senses.

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:09.280
 Senses, always cry away, cry away, cry away. Even we've got something that still is not enough and

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:11.920
 then we make so much trouble.

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:17.920
 To ourselves, to the others. Then it ended up more difficult, more trouble.

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:24.660
 Anybody, particularly, also got good practice and being as practiced, they started with good

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:26.920
 practice and practice comes so good.

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:37.920
 But demon of the pleasures, always mess obstacles. They came so naively, so quietly, so sneakily.

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:45.990
 They attacked me, attacking, undermining the call of the identity of the precious life, precious

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:46.920
 practices.

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:55.920
 And then it really throw on the ditch, ditch or throw in the ravine, ravine of the troubles.

00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:03.920
 Therefore, it is known as demon of the pleasures or distractions. It distracts us.

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:07.920
 It distracts you, even not notice it, it distracts you.

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:14.370
 Kind of because we're crying so much, we're upset so much, it just goes ahead and then it's even sp

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:15.920
innert arms, it's too late.

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:22.920
 That happened. So therefore, it's called demon of the pleasures or demon of the distractions.

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:31.740
 So practicing of the Vedic life will remove those troubles, plus all the different kind of unwanted

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:32.920
 obstacles comes.

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:39.920
 And then it will break practice of the Vedic life, will bring the realization of the Buddha.

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:45.160
 And the Vedic life practice is one of the very famous practices in the Tibetan Buddhism, in

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:47.920
 particular in the Myanmar schools of the Tibetan Buddhism.

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:54.710
 It is one of the 12 practices and in the famous practices, through Vedic life practice, so many

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:58.920
 practitioners achieve the highest realization, one after another.

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:03.920
 And that is really about the Vedic life, what it means.

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:16.070
 And the next one is the great mother, Truma. Truma means, actually say in English, means rock, or

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:17.920
 not English, Sanskrit.

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:29.560
 Vaidya vadai. So it's Vaidya vadai. As we went all the day, last week, that higher giver and Vaidya

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:29.920
 vadai, this is Vaidya vadai. Truma.

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:38.920
 And so, by practicing, she will granted, achieve the accomplishment, the slums.

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:46.980
 Again accomplishment, there is two accomplishments in the teaching. The ordinary accomplishment,

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:48.920
 ultimate accomplishment.

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:57.450
 The ordinary accomplishment, it will bring happy and peace, peace and activities, and as well as

00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:05.550
 overpower our perceptions, and subjugating our ego-clinging and obstacles, and then bring the

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:06.920
 realization.

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:14.350
 And he is mother of the old Buddhas. Why? As in the Buddha teaching said, in the ultimate level or

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:18.920
 in the Dharma kind level, he is no other than Parjapara Mata.

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:24.920
 As Buddha often used metaphor, mother of the old Buddhas.

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:31.920
 Mother of the old past Buddha, mother of the present Buddha, mother of the future Buddhas.

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:38.920
 Or even Buddha mentioned, she has four different children. This mother has four different children.

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:46.890
 Children of the Arhatas, children of the Harvakas, her children of the Bodhisattvas, children of

00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:47.920
 the Buddhas.

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:59.640
 All this Harvaka, because of the contract being with mother, they got the achievement of the Harv

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:01.920
aka or Arhatas.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:08.000
 And by practicing close contract with Mother of the Parjapara Mata or the Truma, they got party

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:08.920
 Buddhas.

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:16.710
 By practicing contract with her, then Bodhisattva was getting realization and they got it, because

00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:20.920
 she is the mother of all the Bodhisattvas.

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:26.790
 By contracting the practices of her and then the Buddha got enlightenment. All Buddhas got

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:27.920
 enlightenment.

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:35.240
 So therefore, Buddha used, she has four children, or mother of the four children, groups of the

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:35.920
 children.

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:43.920
 That is what she is. All our realization, understanding comes because of understanding of her head.

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:49.920
 And the absolute level, what she is, these two practices.

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:57.780
 As we do, Zocchi teaching, we went, Zocchi teaching, two practices is the absolute Mother of the

00:14:57.780 --> 00:14:59.920
 Parjapara Mata and Mother of the Truma.

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:04.920
 Mother of the Parjapara Mata, practicing it.

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:12.920
 And then, again, she appeared in the form of the Samdu Gaya, known as the Parjapara Mata, or the Tr

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:12.920
uma.

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:18.920
 There are many, many, all five female Buddhas and so forth.

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:25.920
 But the essence of what they are, they know that it is embodiment of love compared to the universe.

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:27.920
 So by that, you will achieve.

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:30.920
 Again, all, well, it should have that is breathing.

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:34.920
 And then by also the Truma practices, it is for two practices.

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:37.920
 Cutting thoroughly all the obstacles.

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:47.920
 Again, as I mentioned other day, the Four Demons are according to two lineage, two practices.

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:49.920
 They are similar, but slightly different.

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:52.920
 Slightly different with it. They identify or highlight that.

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:57.920
 They are all the same. What I said already, the Four Demons and these Four Demons, they are really

00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:57.920
 the same.

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:02.920
 They are nothing big different, but however, Trumunas are different.

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:10.920
 And those are Four Demons, are the demon of the tangibles, demon of the untangibles, demon of the

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:16.920
 excitement, a demon of the ego cling or clingings.

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:18.920
 Those are the Four Demons.

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:23.920
 By practicing Ju, Ju is available again cutting thoroughly.

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:27.920
 Cutting thoroughly is one of the very famous practices of Tibetan Buddhism.

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:32.920
 And they started, of course, we are going to remember some of the teachers and hear that teaching.

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:36.920
 They are known as famous, master-known, part Ambasanti.

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:40.920
 He bought that teaching, he shared it with the Tibetan practitioners and become there.

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:47.920
 And then very famous, but he will start with the emanation of the wisdom of Dakini.

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:51.920
 This is Swadya. Swadya is known as Matik Labdum.

00:16:51.920 --> 00:17:00.920
 She really highlights it, emphasizes it, and then she becomes the big, great, famous Ju masters.

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:06.920
 And Pundal of the Ju Meetings, in a way, she found it, which is not something completely new.

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:13.700
 It is teaching of the Murappaya Masambhava, or Bodakshat Yamuni, Murappaya Masambhava, and Patambas

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:13.920
anti.

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:21.920
 But she highlights that so many become so popular practices in Tibetan, all Tibetan Buddhism.

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:25.920
 Not just the one Tibetan, it is all Tibetan teachings.

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:31.920
 So this, that teaching, what is again, is known as the union of the Ju teaching.

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:38.920
 It is the union, combined essence teachings of the Pandya Paramada, and the Vedayana teaching.

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:44.920
 Combined Toganishi, she, and her name is Matik Labdum.

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:48.920
 And Muneo, you know that, Swadya famous, famous.

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:56.490
 She is living wisdom Dakini came in Tibet, in the center of Tibet, in around, I think, maybe 11th

00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:57.920
 century, around that time.

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:01.920
 She came. So she took that, and the Bodashita.

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:07.920
 By cutting those four demons, or by doing that four demons,

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:12.920
 and then achieving them, highly accomplished humans, accomplished them.

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:14.920
 So that's what it is all said.

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:20.920
 And then to activate it, to carry on that, stay on the track all the time,

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:25.920
 it is well performed, that help us, it's done, by the Mahakads.

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:27.920
 What would you do, Matik?

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:35.920
 And all the other demons, follow us. But, prefer those goals, goals for to achieve enlightenment,

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:40.920
 or to achieve our enlightenment, our own, and benefit to all the demons, too.

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:48.920
 That will be performed by the Mahakali, and as well as the other Mahapalas.

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:57.920
 Yes, if you pray strongly here, and naturally will bring true accomplishment naturally,

00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:02.920
 you don't have to make effort to accomplish a human,

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:09.920
 by practicing duchen, and vedya kalaya, and guru yoga, as you are practicing,

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:15.920
 and it will bring naturally a accomplishment that will benefit you.

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:19.920
 You will benefit to yourself, to the other beings.

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:26.920
 Thank you, and naturally will come. It's just easily will come.

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:35.920
 And so, naturally add to others, add to yourself,

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:41.920
 and simultaneously will come those fulfillment naturally to you.

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:52.920
 And that's said, because, of course, by the Monastic Wild Order Book Choo,

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:58.920
 Yichirabh Sahib, Om Om Yichirabh Sahib, and also his Yogi.

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:04.920
 And he asked, so, for that reason, then I, Yichirabh Yichirabh Sahib,

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:10.920
 which made, and I hope, his own digital motif, I said that, may it benefit to you,

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:13.920
 and may it benefit to all the beings.

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:16.920
 That's completed these teachings, isn't it?

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:22.920
 So, that is the entire teaching of this, really, and then,

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:24.920
 I will summarize this, what I said.
