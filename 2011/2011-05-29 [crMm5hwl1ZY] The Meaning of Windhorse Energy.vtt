00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.560
 As well as also the strengthening of meditation and, again, practice, it's just a really wonderful

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:07.440
 time,

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:15.120
 wonderful moment to be together in this beautiful country, in beautiful places, in beautiful area

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.560
 or temple.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.960
 I'm very grateful, thankful you all will be here to be together with us and with practice.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:32.480
 And then as you all know, this time, with Ristatana, our practice, meditation, and also named as,

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.000
 known as the windhorse energy, energy, raising of the windhorse energy.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.200
 This windhorse energy practice is generally very, very important in the Buddha's teaching,

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.920
 taught, and as well as very much highlighted by the great master, Murugan Maasimha.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.920
 And then all those great master, one after another, every great teacher, and including, as we know,

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.440
 the great, our teacher, Hinti Baddishar Murugan, is also always kind of focused on doing every

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.000
 moment

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.800
 or every session that he do these practices, he activated his practices, even every end of the

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:16.080
 session, you know, or mostly end of the sessions, he called flat jallos. This flat jallos, one way,

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:23.200
 is upon in a kind of very casual, but it's also casual, same time is very deep meaning

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.440
 of the raising of this positive energy. Fly is the Tibetan word, which means divine.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:37.360
 The divine call it with energy is our vitality of the Buddha nature. That is what really raising up

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:37.360
.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.520
 And jallos is a Tibetan word, which means victorious. So, victorious is the positives.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:50.400
 And commonly, that is what is, but the great master, Murugan, and as well as Hinti Baddishar

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:58.480
 Murugan, always taught. This flat jallos means many levels, but deep down, it means our courage,

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:05.040
 commitment, confidence, and we target with this, the beautiful inner Chinese call it,

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:13.440
 that we all inherited, which is our own beings, our unique call it, inherited in the Buddha nature.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:21.600
 Or which is Buddha nature. That is what really brings up. That is glorified. Because this is not

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:29.040
 glorified. This is, this Buddha nature is hidden. This positive energy is hidden with so many

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:36.400
 turbulence of the, all the emotions and happiness is really dimmed in ourself. Then what is,

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:44.440
 externally we feel very discouraged, disappointment, and kind of like not going well, everything

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.120
 alone.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:51.040
 And then we feel so kind of bad, weak, and disappointment. And then also losing our

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.720
 confidence. And then kind of not good everything around us. And this not good, that not good.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.960
 And then deep down, eventually, if it turns back to ourself, we become beginning to blame it to

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:10.960
 ourself. All those happened because we didn't glorify our potential, our goodness call it,

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:20.080
 of the inherited, this Buddha, Buddha, Buddha, Buddha, Buddha, Buddha, Buddha, Buddha, Buddha.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:32.720
 Thank you. So therefore, this is what we are raising of this wind horse energy.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:39.120
 This is, and the wind is very important. Again, every time when we practice,

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:47.840
 always you build, calm wind, wisdom wind. Wind is really so important. I mean, this,

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.040
 actually in the Buddha's teaching and in the higher teaching of the, of the Vedayana teaching,

00:03:53.040 --> 00:04:00.400
 mentioned this like the subtle wind and consciousness. That is what is moving forward

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:07.200
 force. It moves from life to life. This consciousness moves with wind energy,

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:14.480
 wind energy. And that is connected to the most subtle wind, wisdom, energies. And then because

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:22.000
 of that, we have all these wind golems, five principle winds, and then five subrent wind,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.920
 which is in the Buddha's teaching and at that dimension, the wind, oh, and then external this

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:34.720
 wind is a big measure for to move and shifting, renew the energy of external level. This wind

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:44.160
 is too, but inwardly this wind is so, so important, so important. This wind lead to the samsara,

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:51.840
 wind lead to the nirvana, wind is like as often they use metaphor as a horse or a vehicle that

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:58.720
 lead every direction. So when we redirect this wind energy and the same at that momentism,

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:04.960
 if we use this energy, then it really makes something, everything so bright and important

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.680
 for those reason, the wind horse. That's what called the wind horse practices.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:19.440
 That's it. So therefore it's very wind is so, so important and so, so, so, so special to use this.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:25.600
 And then this time we're using this wind energy as a raising wind horse energy, which is in the

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:34.550
 bed called the lungtam, and which is again, which we use this color, the mantra, intention and idea

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.640
,

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:42.000
 and then external support of the wind wind, all that bring up this blow, this blowing, like,

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:51.520
 what's called this name, blowing, blowing, blowing the wind. But what is does that is external,

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:58.640
 but in early our vitality of the old energies began to grow. And our energies then in the

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:04.400
 in the Buddha's teaching, what there's five different energies, wisdom energies,

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:12.240
 those five wisdom energies are reflected in the form of colors. Those are the white, yellow, red,

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:17.680
 blue, green, those are named. So you're using those external, that circumstance,

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:23.920
 interdependent coordinate systems. And that reflecting to the inwardly and then

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:31.280
 restarting out this beautiful energy, energy and physically energy. And then it goes to deep down

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:37.120
 to the Buddha nature is bright up our energy. And then it brings, I mean, it's bright, brings out

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:44.800
 energy, confidence. And then our correct, correct, confidence, commitment, our love, kindness,

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:51.360
 understand, all those really comes very strong. And with that reflect externally, also the

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:57.680
 circumstance are really changed in the chapter, it created or it brings up the beautiful film of

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:03.600
 the circumstance and the conditions so that so we can have good performance also in, in the world

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:09.680
 levels and something, everything comes so nicely, beautiful, good health, joy, peace, happiness,

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:15.120
 prosperity, kind of furniture, everything kind of comes nice. And even the difficult comes,

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:20.160
 it kind of, we have some skills and methods that we're not crocheted by this circumstance.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:26.960
 And rather it ignited our quality of commitment, glorified that all this happens. So this is what

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:34.000
 really it means, this wind force added, this is something so special. And then in the opening,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 when you ask some great masters what to need to do and ask in it ability to do that also sometimes

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:48.720
 a lot on what's called divinations, divinations. And when you ask the wafer of the, your lives and

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:54.640
 the situation, you do this, ask it to, they will do the divination. When they do divinations,

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:59.840
 then also there's a lot of things that they always say you need to raise up the wind force and you

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:05.440
 raise up the brave flex and so on and so forth. And then they do that two or three brave flex,

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:10.880
 four brave flex. But here we do so many brave flexes. So it's really that we all don't talk

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:16.560
 with the brave of this, this energy, wind horse energy or this beautiful metallic ecologist is

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:22.800
 very, very special to do. And that we do within such as practice of the, oh, Mantra and Guru Pima,

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:30.800
 Sambhava and white umbrella or the Tara, all such as then the Kesa, and as well as then

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:39.760
 such as Yankthi Chimo Kundi, which is the tool of the, that will defeat all the negative forces.

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:47.120
 So forth, this is all is so special practices. So therefore, it is really very special to do this.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:54.320
 And then for joking this, we are doing this time is with the white umbrella. Again, white umbrella

00:08:54.320 --> 00:09:00.800
 practices is so that you all know, many of you already heard is very special practices. And

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:07.600
 actually white umbrella is the emanation of Tara or Tara is the emanation of the white umbrellas.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:12.800
 And in the, in the teachings said the Buddha Chaturmani, when he give this particular, this

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:18.960
 white umbrella teaching, he was to see the heaven in the, exactly that in front of the, where in

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:19.120
 the

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:26.240
 relief in that, in the way his path or garden Buddha is residing in that beautiful places,

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:32.640
 really many Sangha members, such as monks and nuns and bodhisattva and many God's lamps,

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:40.320
 all that they are there. And that moment, then Buddha entered such as Samadhi, known as then

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:46.960
 that behold of the the deep meaning of the kurumjakra and the kurumjakra meditation,

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:53.520
 the Buddha entered in that chakra and that moment, then sub-echoed the whole teaching of the white

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:59.920
 umbrella from the kurumjakra and all that teaching came, the white umbrella teaching. And this

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:00.160
 white

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:16.540
 umbrella teaching is then known as like as in here is, I mean that the sutra is called white

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:17.040
 umbrella,

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:27.520
 umbrella that defeated all the negative forces and and as well as reversed all the bad

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:34.960
 circumstances to the favorable conditions. And that is the title of the sutra of the what the

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:42.960
 Buddha when he entered in the kurumjakra meditation stages. So, so that is the, what the teaching

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:43.440
 is.

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:51.120
 And this means that like that would defeat all that, all that defeated in all negative forces.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:58.240
 And again, what is negative forces? There is external negative forces and then inner negative

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:05.840
 forces. External negative forces such as often known as then all the bad circumstances, externals,

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:13.520
 that is visible and tangible ways, intangible ways. Those are known as like like yeah,

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:22.560
 intangible, intangible. Untangible obstacles as related with humans, animals, fires or the

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:31.040
 poor elements, fire, water, winds. Those are the like tangible obstacles, obstacles. Intangible

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:37.040
 obstacles such as then invisible beings. We have some kind of thought of the invisible beings like

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:43.520
 spirit, what they are thinking of as the spirit, all the negative such as a ghost or some kind of

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:49.280
 invisible beings that's it. They're making some obstacles. Generally in the Buddha's teaching,

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:55.680
 human being is one of the beings among the six realms. There is many other beings and those are

00:11:55.680 --> 00:12:05.040
 known as them and such as hunger ghosts and asuras and as well gods. And many times those are

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:05.600
 invisible

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:12.400
 beings are connected with sometimes hunger ghosts or could be asuras. Anyway, there is in the

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:17.840
 teaching, there is many also kind of invisible beings. And those invisible beings are not

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:25.040
 necessarily always makes us trouble, trouble to us. But however, sometimes we human beings are also

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:34.320
 went on their ways or we did they kind of had some obstacles and some kind of hindrance to them.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:34.560
 And

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:41.680
 then their reality too. They make some obstacles and then it make them uncomfortable and then

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:49.360
 become maybe more obstacles to us, effort more us than to them immediately levels. But generally in

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:53.760
 the Buddha's teaching often he said and teaching of the Gurbi of Mahasambhava that we can make

00:12:53.760 --> 00:13:02.320
 lot of obstacles to them. More, more we can make obstacles than than then they ask eventually.

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:07.600
 Because human beings are very much powerful generally with the many different academic

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:13.830
 conditions and such as well as also many different like they have some positive energies and such

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:14.080
 as

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:19.600
 the teachings and the practices. If we didn't use the right way those teachings and practices with

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:25.440
 right motivation that really could make big interference. And then sometimes we make also

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:31.760
 kind of a little bit more only thinking of us and not thinking of others or them. Then we make

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:41.040
 kind of very big unbalanced and uncomfortable to them. And such as for example in Gurbi of Mahasamb

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:41.200
hava

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:45.360
 teaching said even those great thetans when they revealed that they are my teachings,

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:51.600
 they're my teachings and always in the teaching said we should not disturb those invisible beings

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:57.440
 within all those invisible beings who are residing that area where they discover at them my

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:57.920
 teaching

00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:03.520
 we should make very special ceremony offerings and kind of respect it to those

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:09.440
 allowance to discover those them a teaching from the earth or from the life or the from the rocky

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:14.560
 mountains. And then after they discover the them my teachings even they have to put something back

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:20.800
 there so it is really balanced and replaced back with ceremony. Those all teaching said and those

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:27.760
 are so important to maintain the intact of the the energy of the element and art element and that

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:34.240
 then immediately effort to the water, fire and wind element and then you go to the space energy

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:40.160
 that teaching said. And these days for example Mankin would always say that too many times he said

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:46.640
 and I heard from other great masters these times modern technology become so strong and they just

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:53.920
 can't without consideration or thinking of anything and they just using as much as they can

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:59.920
 with all the elements in particular art and water and so forth and they disturb really that and I

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:05.120
 think that might maybe the one reason there's so many natural disasters are coming one after

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:05.520
 another

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:12.880
 that it may be is not used to be maybe 20 years ago or 30 years ago I mean or that time maybe we

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:18.800
 don't have exactly this new niche coverage and that because we that's why we don't have but now

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:25.120
 there's so many things happening one after another and this is the old kind of disturb the element

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:30.240
 I think that's really occurred in my teaching and the teaching of the group and my summer and then

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:37.280
 Buddha teaching that's what I think is really happening and therefore again so for those all

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:43.040
 reasons if we do this for some of the spray flakes this wind raising of the wind horse energy

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:49.600
 it's not just a wheel raising of the wind horse and our self every time our practice is connected

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:55.520
 with both each other and that's the teaching of the Buddha and some of all the great masters

00:15:55.520 --> 00:16:01.120
 when we raise up this wind horse energy when we raise up the spray flakes when it's blowing the

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:07.520
 air to every different directions it carries that our beautiful motivation with the blessings of

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:07.680
 the

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:14.080
 Buddha's mantra and their meditation according to their instruction it really spread out all over
