00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.500
 So when we're in an eruption, could you give us just a few lines to remember, to apply those lines

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.000
 and to re-establish the view competently?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:21.770
 I don't know if I can do anything more than what all the teachings really said, so say that, but of

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:29.000
 course in samsara generally there's so many of these different ups and don'ts and all these things,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 and particularly nowadays, Dzogchen at times, according to the teaching, there's so many

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 difficulties and challenges, one after another is happening.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:53.910
 But even though it's happening, I think what a great master, Master Khimpon Yingmin Putho, Khimpon

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.000
 Yingmin was told to the group and to his students.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:07.160
 In the Tibetan world, what he said, he said, "Jensi mapro, ranso ma sharu." That's the Tibetan

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.000
 world, what he said, that is really that.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 "Jensi mapro" means don't disturb the mind of others. Don't disturb the mind of others.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:31.420
 And then, "Ranso ma sharu" means don't lose your identity. That's the two worlds that he's told to

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.000
 his students.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.440
 Now I thought that's really, I think it's wonderful, wonderful. I thought, "Pose jensi mapro is not

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:50.000
 disturbing the mind of others," means don't get upset and anger and become emotional.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.380
 Because that, if we become that, it may not help. Instead, maybe more disturb, it's more. So

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:03.000
 therefore, he said, "Jensi mapro."

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 And then, don't lose your identities. Our identity is practitioners.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.360
 Our identity, we can keep with the practitioners of the bodhisattvas, bodhicitta. So therefore,

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:26.000
 support, more patience, more loving-kindness, more praise, good praise.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:34.480
 That's what we can really do, and don't lose our identity of the bodhicitta and identity of the

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.000
 practitioners.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 That's what really he said. So I think that's really, I thought, very good, these turbulent times.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 But at the same time, we're kind of repocusing and reactivating our bodhicitta as much as we can.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.850
 Really, that is, I think only we can help, because we can't do anything, big things with what's

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.000
 happening in the world.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.420
 Even if it's not good, we can't do too much. And for that reason, just really do the four boneless

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.000
 prayers.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:21.850
 And as well as, then it's kind of simple, and kind of like very, without disturbing and losing our

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:28.000
 identity, we can help and to adjust a little bit to the way we can help others,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:35.190
 or to those situations that we can then excellent. But otherwise, it's just really like to build

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:42.000
 our self, more bodhicitta, more practice, and that's, I think, really kind of, I think that.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 I mean, that's what the teaching said, so that's it. Thank you.
