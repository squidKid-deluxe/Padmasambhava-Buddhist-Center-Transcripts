00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.200
 As we begin, as always, remembering the really essential points of our practice, the three

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.600
 essential motivations of all the practices that we have.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:25.680
 Because again, just like from the very beginning, the Buddha pointed out the nature as it is, and

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.200
 then through all the yanas, it's just they become more and more precise and clear.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:40.030
 Likewise, in one voice with all of our great noble teachers, going all the way back to the Buddha

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.840
 and beyond, reflecting on our motivation right from the beginning is essential.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:55.190
 And so what are those three motivations? Again, connecting with our joy, our devotion, our ren

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:01.360
unciation, reflecting on the four thoughts that turn the mind toward the Dharma.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:12.650
 Really recognizing how truly precious and rare and fleeting and dynamic this opportunity is that we

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:21.970
 have now, and how many beautiful, how many situations we're free of that would hinder our self-ref

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.680
lection and ability to cultivate our goodness qualities.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:36.130
 And not only that, but engender it with so many good, both inner proclivities as well as outer

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:42.720
 circumstances that not help to connect us with this precious moment.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:51.750
 So that's called renunciation or joy, devotion, less obsession, cherishing how precious this is.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:59.000
 And then our bodhicitta motivation, really sincerely connecting in our heart to whatever level we

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:08.250
 can, our loving kindness and our care, concern, our love, compassion, joy, and equanimity for every

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.280
 being.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:26.230
 Really expanding. And then again, the devotion, our pure perception. Try to connect with this truly

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:37.600
 sacred view, how this is the perfect time, this is the perfect place.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:46.430
 We have the perfect teacher, the perfect teaching, all the perfect gathering to receive and take

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:57.350
 them to heart. Right now in this moment, that's the view of the Vajrayana, which has the great

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:06.080
 heart of vast compassion and bodhicitta, and really seeing directly into the nature, full of joy,

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.520
 devotion, courage, commitment.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:19.320
 Just connecting with those three vatra states of the purity of all that's arising. And looking to

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.520
 the heart of that.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:29.960
 And last week we began to talk a little bit about the guru yoga section in the nundra. And so I

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.520
 just thought there were a couple questions that came.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:40.050
 And just to say a few points, maybe we didn't have time for last week. And that session was

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:50.090
 recorded so it can be reviewed, but in essence, you know, the guru yoga, we went over the word

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.520
 meaning, the Sanskrit and the Tibetan.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:04:03.520
 So, you know, again, reflecting on the meaning of the words can really bring out our heart.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:13.740
 So guru is heavy, rich, saturated with realization and blessings like a great rain cloud or wish

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:22.520
 fulfilling tree laden with fruit. You know, high one is the guru as the teacher.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:31.720
 And yoga is yoke or union. And then of course then in the Tibetan is lama, like unsurpassable one,

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:40.900
 unsurpassable realization, the mind of the Buddha, realizing the Dharma embodied in our life as the

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.520
 Sangha, the teacher and the Sangha.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:56.880
 And now drawers the Tibetan word for yoga to kind of discover our in the real condition of things,

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:06.520
 one, so discovering the real condition of things, what is that but the Buddha's path.

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:17.520
 And no Buddha has ever come who didn't have a teacher or a guide said.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:28.380
 And so, definitely, the teacher is so central, right, without the Buddha coming into the world and

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.520
 teaching, where would we be.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:41.290
 There's that. And then the lama is so central, so essential. Again, why the lama embodies the

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:48.520
 Buddha, the Dharma, the Sangha.

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:59.520
 All, you know, the gurus, all the Yidams, all the Dakini's and enlightened activity.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.520
 The guru is the Buddha.

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:10.520
 And like it said, the guru who appears in our very life is kinder than the Buddha's.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:18.780
 Because they're here in this life under Manakaya, who's come to us. And so we just went over some

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:25.320
 of that, those precious essence, but it can't be I think, again and again, the teacher stress

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:29.520
 devotion is so vital, so important.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:34.520
 And devotion again, we can't force devotion.

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:40.520
 And in the teachings, right, there's the three faiths or three devotions.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.520
 There's interested faith.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:48.520
 When we just begin to hear some of the teachings and they sound interesting.

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:56.610
 And then we actually learn more, our faith and our devotion increases, which means our trust, our

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:04.520
 closeness feeling, our respect, our appreciation in a way to our longing and our openness.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:10.580
 Our mind opens more, our heart opens more because there's that lushness of trust. I mean, you all

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:15.520
 can think for yourself, of course, the meaning of what devotion is for you.

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:23.240
 I'm just reflecting also what I've heard from our great teachers who are so clearly full of

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.520
 devotion.

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:33.820
 But it's so vital, you know, said that devotion is the key to enlightenment. Devotion is also like

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:37.520
 the hook to which we can catch.

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:46.460
 I mean, not the hook, the hoop through which we can catch the hook of all the blessings and

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:49.520
 compassion of the Buddhas.

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:58.260
 As we continue to study and practice, our trust, our closeness feeling grows and becomes more and

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.520
 more certain.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:07.520
 And then until it's completely unshakable and inseparable from the true nature, really, right?

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:14.570
 So we went over that. And again, learning about the lineage is a beautiful way to encourage our

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:15.520
 devotion.

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:25.030
 I mean, looking just at reading the life stories of the great masters, it really opens our mind to

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:31.520
 what's possible and also directly connects us with some of their activities in this world.

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:38.800
 And of course, here with the Guru Yoga, we're focusing on Padmasambhava, embodiment of all the Budd

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:46.520
has of the three times, who appeared, I mean, who's inseparable from the Dharmakaya,

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:57.180
 which is so clearly shining and separately, rising compassion, all-pervading, and then just like it

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:05.460
 said in Guru Bhishai stories, like a vast rain, you know, raining emanations in myriad world

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:07.520
 systems and realms.

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:17.520
 And then in this particular world system and realm appeared as the lake-born Guru, you know.

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:24.650
 And then even from there, so many emanations and activities of Guru Padmasambhava that still

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:31.520
 continue and still touch the minds and hearts of so many practitioners up until this day.

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:38.800
 So reading a little on the life of Guru Padmasambhava can be so beautiful. There are so many bi

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:44.520
ographies that are also terma from the words of Guru Padmasambhava himself.

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:51.090
 So many life stories you're given, like one really famous one that's been translated by Shambhala,

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:52.520
 the lotus-born.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:10:00.520
 The life story of Padmasambhava is beautiful, I mean, just to connect.

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:08.590
 And then you know, Kim Po Se Wong Rinpoche wrote a really beautiful series of poems that's, I don't

00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:14.520
 know, if you haven't read it, I highly suggest it's so beautiful.

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:22.920
 It's a devotional poem praising Guru Padmasambhava in all of aspects and all the different

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.520
 activities.

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:31.520
 So it's biography and devotional verse. It's wonderful.

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:37.240
 So, I mean, there's a few. And then, of course, there's other teachings on different manifestations

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:43.510
 of Guru Padmasambhava, things like that, as well as a lot can be found even online at like Lotzawa

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:45.520
 House I mentioned last week.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:53.880
 It's a wonderful website for seeing many really quality translations. But among them, there's, you

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:57.520
 know, many stories of Guru Padmasambhava.

00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:04.770
 But really, than any of the lineage masters, Guru Padmasambhava, again, is the root teacher of all

00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:06.520
 Tibetan Buddhism.

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:14.660
 Not only a living Buddha of this time, of this world, of this degenerate age, clearing away our

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:23.520
 obstacles, bringing and supporting us to realize the true nature.

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:31.690
 So alive with us this moment, but then also on the outer level of when we take refuge in the Lama,

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:34.520
 we take refuge in the Sangha.

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:38.520
 We take refuge in the Dharma.

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:48.910
 Ultimately, we're taking mind in the realization of the Guru, the realization and the power and

00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:56.520
 abilities of the Buddha, who again, taught through so many ways.

00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:04.520
 And then the Dharma, there's scripture, there's the words, but more important, there's the meaning.

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:10.520
 The meaning is, of course, alive and fully realized in every way with the Lama.

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:18.210
 But how does that manifest for us? Again, the Buddhas appear according to the needs and capacities

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:21.520
 of beings, including ourselves.

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:28.920
 Like, you know, like it said, like the way one moon will reflect in every body of water throughout

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:36.520
 all the landscape, from the smallest little dimple in a rock to a vast ocean.

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:42.520
 You know, such the namanakayas are appearing.

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:51.600
 But not only that, on so many ways, what we have now is due to the embodiment of Guru Padmasambhav

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.520
as' enlightened activities,

00:12:54.520 --> 00:13:02.520
 which is also all of our Sangha brothers and sisters who are, to the best of their abilities,

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:05.520
 applying the teachings to their minds and hearts

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:14.570
 and supporting our venerable teachers of this time, and who are they, but goes back to their

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:19.520
 teachers and all of the community, all the Sangha of that time,

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:27.930
 all the teachers and Sanghas, all the way back to Guru Padmasambhava establishing the teachings in

00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:28.520
 Tibet.

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:34.630
 Like, that's something Rinpoche's very clearly say in many of their teachings. Connecting with the

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:40.520
 Guru in our life is like being one of the 25 heart students.

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:45.520
 It's our opportunity as we are at this moment.

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:51.950
 And not only Padmasambhava, but all the way back to the Buddha, this is an unbroken lineage. And if

00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:55.520
 we just think about, I mean, so wonderful,

00:13:55.520 --> 00:14:06.450
 all of that courage and commitment, all of that joy and devotion that we are just surrounded by,

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:07.520
 right, in our life.

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:16.820
 Even this, having this technology, every detail that brings this opportunity to the Dharma in our

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:20.520
 lives, it's profound and it's vast.

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:25.520
 So just, again, I'm just trying to encourage contemplating about these things.

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:35.500
 It just naturally unlocks, I think, the richness of things, going all the way to the Buddha and

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:36.520
 beyond.

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:43.680
 And so then we also talked about, last week, went through the visualization of the Guru Yoga,

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:47.520
 ourselves as Vajrayogini with the visualization,

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:54.570
 Guru Padmasambhava before us and the visualization. Again, the main essence of visualization is

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:57.520
 dropping all of our mundane conception,

00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:05.520
 realizing this is a pure land, Guru Padmasambhava is with us, feeling that presence.

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:12.520
 And then from our heart of hearts, reciting the supplication we have.

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:19.520
 And then when we have time, this profound seven-line prayer.

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:29.970
 And then along with the visualization, reciting the Vajra Guru Mantra, Om Ah Hung Vajra Guru Pima

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:31.520
 Siddhi Hung,

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:36.520
 letting that resound and recite, and as we're doing that, maintaining the visualization,

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:42.520
 receiving all the blessings from Guru Padmasambhava in all the myriad ways,

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:49.580
 letting them cleanse us, remove all of our obscurations, as well as those going to all beings of

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:50.520
 all realms,

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:58.780
 removing all of their obscurations, raining down blessings, purifying, generating our merit by rec

00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:02.520
iting the mantra and invoking our devotion,

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:11.720
 having that repertoire back and forth, receiving all the blessings. So the main part is reciting

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:13.520
 the Vajra Guru Mantra,

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:20.090
 and then once we are familiar enough, of course we know with every section of Nundra we do an

00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:21.520
 accumulation.

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:28.790
 So just for that clarity, when you're doing the accumulation on the Guru Yoga, it's with the Vajra

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:29.520
 Guru Mantra,

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:36.520
 Om Ah Hung Vajra Guru Pima Siddhi Hung, so each one, recite is one.

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:45.520
 And so then you can set the container for your visualization time being, say, one mala,

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:53.430
 which one mala means going around once, which equals a hundred, or ten malas, however much you have

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:54.520
 time for.

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:59.520
 And then eventually when we're really doing accumulation practices with the Nundra,

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:04.650
 we want to, of course, we're going to be accumulating at least a hundred thousand of each section

00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:05.520
 of the Nundra,

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:13.120
 so this will be accumulating at least a hundred thousand of the sessions where we're reciting the

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:14.520
 Vajra Guru Mantra.

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:18.520
 So we're reciting Vajra Guru Mantra a hundred thousand times.

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:24.520
 And then, of course, then in the end, confirming, receiving the blessings,

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:31.520
 and then just mingling our mind with the heart of the Guru.

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:41.520
 Like it says, behold the emptiness awareness, the true face of the Lama, resting in our awareness.

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:55.100
 Or like Kenpo Sewan Rinpoche says, these just profound instructions, such a good support in our

00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:58.520
 daily prayers book.

00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:05.520
 Of course, now I can't find it.

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:08.520
 Nor can I remember on the spot.

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:14.520
 Seated with body and mind at ease, mindful of joy, devotion, bodhicitta,

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:23.520
 not dwelling on past or future thoughts, right now relax within true nature's splendor.

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:34.520
 So page 48, which is really nice, completely concise essence instructions on the whole path,

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:42.520
 but especially this point when we sit to rest in Rigpa, which is the ultimate blessing.

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:50.520
 So making that strong connection with Guru Padmasambhala is important and vital,

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:56.520
 because again, why is the Buddha Dharma Sangha?

00:18:56.520 --> 00:19:00.520
 And we all have that potential in our heart.

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:09.520
 The Buddha Dharma is nothing but the authentic nature, fully realized, right?

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:18.520
 And then of course, in the teachings it said so many times,

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:26.520
 the Buddha himself and Guru Padmasambhala, just thinking of me, I'm there.

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:31.520
 That's in essence.

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:36.520
 Whenever you think of me, I'm there to remove obscuration,

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:41.520
 and will remove obscurations and bestow blessings.

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:49.520
 The Buddhas, those who are fully awakened are not at all hindered

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:55.520
 by our concept of time, place or distance.

00:19:55.520 --> 00:20:04.520
 That realization, that omniscience, that power, ability, that bodhicitta is all pervading.

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:08.520
 There's no limitations to the fully enlightened ones.

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:13.520
 Guru Padmasambhala embodying them, our whole situation.

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:19.520
 Guru Padmasambhala is mandala.

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:27.520
 Guru Padmasambhala said, "For those with devotion, I'm there at your door."

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:32.520
 So there's even that funny story of a great nimalama,

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:39.520
 who one day, I think, forgive me, my memory is really bad.

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:46.520
 In a nutshell, this other great teacher from another school, I think,

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:51.520
 was climbing in the nimalamas, the nimma, of course, and the kagyu,

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:58.520
 and the Padmasambhala is so really strong there.

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:03.520
 But this one teacher was kind of being playful, I think, I don't know.

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:08.520
 He was climbing in the window, and the teacher said, "Why are you doing that?"

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:15.520
 He said, "Well, I've heard that Guru Padmasambhala was lying on your doorstep."

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:20.520
 But anyway, sorry, that's...

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:26.520
 But the point is, really, doing the practice

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:30.520
 will only reap the benefits by actually doing it.

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:36.520
 But hearing these un-deceiving words of the Buddhas,

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:44.520
 where the Buddha is un-deceiving, Guru Padmasambhala is un-deceiving.

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:49.520
 Right?

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:54.520
 And they've said these words, "When you think of me, I'm there."

00:21:54.520 --> 00:22:00.520
 So all the time, whenever that is,

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:05.520
 there are not any certain times when we can pray

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:09.520
 and then when Guru Pashay is not with us is my point.

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:14.520
 But then, we did get a question about the 10th day.

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:19.520
 On the 10th day of the waxing moon,

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:26.520
 we always do special practices on Guru Padmasambhala, special guru yoga practice.

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:30.520
 And so Ken asked about that.

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:34.520
 And so I thought I could say a little bit about that,

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:39.520
 but I wanted to really especially make that note that

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:45.520
 any time, there's no limits for the Buddhas

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:50.520
 and there's no limits with devotion bodhicitta

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:53.520
 as far as connecting with the blessings.

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:58.520
 But yes, on the 10th day of the month is really special.

00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:02.520
 And of course, this is with the Tibetan calendar, a lunar calendar.

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:05.520
 So again, on this outer level,

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:10.520
 the calendar is in sync with the cycles of the outer world,

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:13.520
 the sun and the moon.

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:17.520
 So the 10th day of the waxing moon is a special day.

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:20.520
 We usually do practice on Guru Padmasambhala.

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:23.520
 And as you all know, the 25th day of the month,

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:26.520
 or which is the 10th day of the waning moon,

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:31.520
 we do special practices of the dakini, wisdom dakini,

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:33.520
 which is also a guru yoga practice.

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:37.520
 But to get to the 10th day practice,

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:40.520
 the 10th day is just special in that sense.

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:46.520
 Again, in our teachings, we're given so many tools

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:50.520
 for kind of connecting with our bodhicitta

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:52.520
 and making our aspirations,

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:55.520
 doing our practice on the rhythms of the nature,

00:23:55.520 --> 00:24:01.520
 kind of riding those waves to kind of make the benefits more powerful.

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:09.520
 And so the waxing moon time is especially increasing time.

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:13.520
 And especially from the kind of quarter moon to the full moon

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:16.520
 is especially prime time.

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:19.520
 And the 10th day is especially beautiful.

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:25.520
 Many of Guru Padmasambhala's activities happened on the 10th day.

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:28.520
 And Guru Padmasambhala himself said,

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:32.520
 especially when he had spent all these years in Tibet

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:36.520
 and when the king and the retinues went up to the mountain pass

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:39.520
 and Guru Padmasambhala was about to depart,

00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:43.520
 he gave those instructions in different texts

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:49.520
 for those devoted disciples who arise at dawn

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:52.520
 and practice on me on the 10th day.

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:56.520
 I'm there with all the sunbeams, all the moonbeams

00:24:56.520 --> 00:25:02.520
 in all of the rainbow light appearing in the sky

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:05.520
 and all the droplets in the rainbow kind of.

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:09.520
 My blessings are there, especially on the 10th day.

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:14.520
 So the 10th day is particularly, again, a very powerful day

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:17.520
 to reconnect with Guru Padmasambhala.

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:22.520
 And then we also know we have the Ganachakra ceremony

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:28.520
 or the Sok ceremony as part of the 10th day practices.

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:31.520
 And of course, if we don't have the opportunity

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:33.520
 and we're by ourselves, we do.

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:38.520
 But then especially, it's especially known as renowned,

00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:43.520
 such a strong practice for all these aspects we have.

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:54.520
 The Sok ceremony means Sok, means to assemble, the assembly.

00:25:54.520 --> 00:26:00.520
 So who's assembled? All the Sangha is assembled.

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:04.520
 And we're meditating on the whole assembly

00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:08.520
 of the mandala of the Guru.

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:12.520
 And we're assembling all beautiful merit,

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:16.520
 making feast offering and offerings.

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:19.520
 So on all those aspects, all the good qualities

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:22.520
 are assembled and connected and offered.

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:26.520
 So we're generating merit in offering.

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:30.520
 But also, it's a very powerful time, again, to do what?

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:36.520
 Purify our obscurations, any mistakes we've made,

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:38.520
 any way we become aware,

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:42.520
 we've perpetuated trouble for ourselves and others,

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:45.520
 recognizing that, getting up, purifying,

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:48.520
 connecting with our intention.

00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:54.520
 So generating merit, purifying, and receiving blessings.

00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:59.520
 We do, again, the swiftly penetrating blessings of the Guru Yoga.

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:03.520
 And so the 10th day, again, I'm trying to cut down on time,

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:07.520
 but I thought, I did look again just because it's easy access.

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:11.520
 On the Lotsawa site, there's a couple of things on the 10th day.

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:15.520
 There's one thing called a bouquet of udumbara flowers,

00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:18.520
 an explanation of the 10th day,

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:21.520
 which is a little more extensive text.

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:25.520
 And then there's also a beautiful text,

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:28.520
 more concise text by Dutram Rinpoche,

00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:34.520
 called the Concise Benefits of the Festival of the 10th Day.

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:40.520
 So in there, every 10th day, in the lunar calendar,

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:45.520
 there's 12 months, sometimes more, where it's doubled.

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:49.520
 So the 10th day of every moon

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:53.520
 is a way of connecting with this one particular activity

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:55.520
 of Guru Padmasambhava.

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:58.520
 So like you'll notice that in our Padmasambhava Buddhist calendar

00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:00.520
 or other Tibetan calendars,

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:03.520
 it will say the 10th day Guru Padmasambhava,

00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:08.520
 known as Guru Pema Dojetsal, for example,

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:11.520
 or Guru Sengedrada.

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:17.520
 So each month has a particular emanation of Guru Padmasambhava

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:19.520
 and remembering his enlightened activity.

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:22.520
 So like this teaching from Dutram Rinpoche

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:24.520
 goes over those things.

00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:28.520
 And then each different soak ceremony also has different benefits.

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:34.520
 But altogether, the benefits are immense.

00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:37.520
 But it's a way for ordinary beings, I think,

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:39.520
 to connect with those blessings.

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:41.520
 And then also just along those lines,

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:47.520
 Kempo Rinpoche's, probably many people know, is another beautiful gem

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:51.520
 and treasure, teachings from Kenshin Pauld and Shera Rinpoche

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:53.520
 and Kempo Seo on Daunjo Rinpoche

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:56.520
 on the eight emanations of Guru Padmasambhava

00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:59.520
 and the specific practices, again,

00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:01.520
 going around the Vajra Guru mantra,

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:05.520
 but connecting on these different aspects of enlightened activity,

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:10.520
 liberating duality with wisdom display.

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:17.520
 So, and then like I said, there was Kempo Seo on Rinpoche's,

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:20.520
 praise to the lotus-born.

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:23.520
 And then more recently, there's a beautiful, again,

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:25.520
 just as far as Guru Rinpoche,

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:28.520
 this beautiful, amazing teaching

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:31.520
 from both of our venerable teachers,

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:36.520
 the last teaching Kenshin Pauld and Shera Rinpoche gave in 2010

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:42.520
 on the seven chapter practices on Guru Padmasambhava.

00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:46.520
 So, there's so many rich ways to just, again,

00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:52.520
 have some study that's reflecting on these beautiful qualities of the Buddhas

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:55.520
 and that particularly from our beautiful teachers

00:29:55.520 --> 00:30:00.520
 who teach so concisely and so completely

00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:03.520
 with, again, not just knowledge, but realization.

00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:05.520
 It's wonderful.

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:11.520
 And then these 10th day festivals are so powerful and important.

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:15.520
 So, I don't have a lot of time to say a whole lot about it,

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:17.520
 but it is there.

00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:26.520
 Again, on the Lotzawa House has that, these teachings there, if you look.

00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:28.520
 If anyone else has questions, please write.

00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:32.520
 I know Lisunya also wrote asking about a couple practices

00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:35.520
 which aren't necessarily guru yoga.

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:38.520
 So, I don't have much to say about that right now,

00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:41.520
 but the real questions seem to be, what are the important things to have?

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:49.520
 And I just say again what I think Rinpoche's would say, Bodhicitta.

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:52.520
 Relax, big Bodhicitta,

00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:57.520
 feeling the living presence of all the Vidyadhara's gurus,

00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:04.520
 the Buddha Dharma Sangha with big Bodhicitta and really big vision,

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:06.520
 joy and appreciation.

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:09.520
 That's what we need for everything we do.

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:12.520
 So, I think I'm going to stop talking now.

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:17.520
 There's so much to say in the big ocean.

00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:19.520
 So, I hope that's a little helpful.

00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:23.520
 And again, if anyone has any questions, please do write in.

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:27.520
 And I saw someone wrote right before the practice.

00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:30.520
 So, I'll try to answer that just directly.

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:32.520
 So, thank you.

00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:38.520
 So, now we'll do the practice itself.

00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:40.520
 Thank you.
