00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.650
 During where we are, by the Bardo of the Birthday Living, there is an additional experience that we

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.000
 go through.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:21.460
 This is called dreaming, and that is dreaming is one of the major part of our life's experience, or

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.000
 the period that we go on.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.990
 This is many times in the book, and Tibetan teaching opened, and you say that half of our life we

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:34.000
 sleep.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.870
 In ancient times, it must be true, because there is not too much electricity, and there is no night

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.000
, and this old night is not too young.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.660
 And in the morning, maybe there will be, there is sleep, when the darkness comes, so maybe there is

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.000
 not too much.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.320
 But now, modern time, in the American or modern time, where there is electricity, then I think we

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.000
 still are left.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 But however still it is, very major part of our life that we spend as a sleep.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 And the sleeping is, of course, important for the board.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 In the medicine teaching, Open said it sustains the body, it is nourishing the body.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 The next day, it is rejuvenating the body.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:35.400
 It is like sleeping, food, and then other exercise, and then as well as meditation, all those, also

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.000
 one way of living, happen to the animals.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:47.920
 And the amount of that, sleeping is very important for the individuals, particularly those who are

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.000
 connected with the five elements,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 or with the gross level, or the desire of the teachers.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 Guards don't have to sleep with the teachers.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 Miraculous or born, usually they don't need to sleep. They don't have to sleep.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 And the level, they don't really need to spend their sleep.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.430
 But therefore, even the God's name, one of the names in the Buddha teaching said it, namsi, means

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.000
 always wake up, always they wake up.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 Right, they don't want to go to bed.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 But desire them, in particular the human realm, we have to sleep.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 This is part of the sustaining, restarting our body.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 And so, when we sleep, most of the time we sleep, sleep.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 And that's why the teaching said here, say, we sleep with the dullness.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 We sleep with it in one way, dullness is ignorance. So we sleep.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 So that means, of course, it happens to the body to sustain that, but there is no really progress

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 to our awareness, our realizations.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 Anything. It's just we sleep.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.980
 So now, for example, even we don't sleep in modern time, as we used to in ancient time, and we have

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.000
 100-year lifespans.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 At least we spent 30 years, solid 30 years, or 35 years to sleep.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 35 years is literacy.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 And now, these accordingly vary on our teaching. Then in the school, it means teaching.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:49.110
 Teaching, we use that time, not just only to have been good for the body, but also for our

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.000
 realization, for our awareness.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:02.220
 Our moral realization. That's for that reason that dream yoga is one of the very important, or

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:08.000
 dream practice, is one of the very important teachings in the very early teachings.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:16.150
 And again, to do these dream yoga practices, or the dream teaching practices, this is, again, we

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.000
 have to start with our mind, with our motivations.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 First, what is dream?

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 Dream is, of course, everyone. We all know that. That is, I think, obvious.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 Because dream is a dream, or dream is illusion.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 That's that everybody knows that. But that is what we do.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:50.820
 This dream, again, to make dream yoga as a kind of dream practices, we have to start, not where we

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.000
 are sleeping.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 We have to start where we are waking up.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 This is, that is, we have to start.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 This, in order to do that, we have to see these four things, what we see.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 Subject, object, everything is a dream.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 Everything, even during the daytime, it is a dream.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 Because dream, what we call, it's a dream, is illusion.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 This is illusion. This day life, day phenomena, is illusion.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 And look, yesterday, day before yesterday, last month,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 month before last month, all those experiences,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 all those, our kind of environment, our visions, our scenery, almost gone.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:55.000
 Gone. What's the difference between those during the daytime experience, last night, our dreams?

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 What is the difference?

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:05.700
 We look careful. In Buddha teaching, teaching on Gurbel Masamma said, "Those all perseve as dreams

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:06.000
."

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 This is not just, we have to think, Buddha said, Gurbel Masamma said, books said,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 "Are you really, with your thing? What is really difference?"

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 Then we can go back to the last years, year before last years.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 In our sense, we had memories. Until now, all our memories,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 all our, that environment, each time those looks like so solid.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 Each time when we experience, same way as we are doing now, those are so solid,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 so real, so true, so unchanging, so strong like that.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 But all gone, one after another, as like ripples.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 Ripples come, each time when we see ripples, where that first ripple went?

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 It just disappeared.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 Similarly, our experience that we went through is all like ripples.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 Ripples came and ripples gone, and we are here now.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 We are now in one of the ripples' status, and we are moving forward that way.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 Today our experience, again, I think all of these things,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 are also the same thing, that ripple, more, is coming to change.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 That's why time changes. We continue to move forward.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 Forward, in all, is just only in the memories.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 Memories, last night our dreams, we had some dreams.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 It's also in the memories.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 Our last years experience all that in the memories.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 That's why Buddha said so many times in the teaching,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 when we throw out, everything is a dream.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 All is really that dream.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 So this is, right now, we are dreaming.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
 This is another dream, that we are dreaming.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
 Not just we are dreaming, we are watching that we are dreaming.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 We are dreaming, but our self is a dream.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 Our own self is a dream.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 We are the dream. I am the dream, and I am the dream.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 So that means subject is a dream, object is a dream,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 and action is a dream. All is a dream.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 Truly this is what it is.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 Then not just only in the memories that we are thinking,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 but also the kind of philosophical thinking is all illusion, relative truth.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 That's what teaching said.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 There is nothing substantial, solid, existing.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000
 All is that bubble. I think those are not what we call here.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 Strength use, strength use, strength use.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 And that's another modern terminology.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
 I think we need strength use.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 What strength use means? Do you think strength use?

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
 You know better than me, strength use.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 That means illusion, I think, is nothing really solid, solid, existing.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 So then, according to that, all is going to the black holes.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 All is going to the black holes.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
 And black hole is unseen states.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
 It's like dreaming, that human is in states.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 So what is really real?

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
 Here, as we grasping like to hell,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 there's nothing is substantially solid, existing.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 From down upon the moon, and more than those genuine scientists' lives.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 Everything is illusion.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 This is what this dream is.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
 But, even though reality is like that,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 about the way what you are in mind thinks.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
 This is so solid, so strong, so genuine.
