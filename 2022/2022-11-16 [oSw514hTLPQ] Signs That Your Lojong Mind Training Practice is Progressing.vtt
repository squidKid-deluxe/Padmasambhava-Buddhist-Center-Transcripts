NOTE     "synopsis": "Ven. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche\n \nNovember 6, 2022\n \nYeshe Tsogyal Temple\n419 E Iris Drive\nNashville, Tennessee 37204\n \nNow is the time to bring the light of joy and inspiration into your life!\n \nMind training, or lojong, are practical instructions on how to transform your mind that were taught by the great master Atisha Dipamkara (982-1054), and were later compiled into seven chapters by the renowned teacher Chekawa Yeshe Dorje (1101\u20131175) who accomplished this practice. This teaching became popular in all schools of Tibetan Buddhism.\n \nThe Seven Points of Mind Training are some of the most profound and effective practices for us to apply in daily life. They bring greater balance and harmony to everything we encounter. Mind training is widely practiced by Tibetan Buddhist masters and practitioners. It is a great practice of nonviolence and peace that powerfully ushers us straight ahead on the path of enlightenment.\n \nThe Seven Points of Mind Training emphasize the practice of bodhichitta, the ultimate remedy taught by Buddha Shakyamuni and Guru Padmasambhava to entirely remove self-absorption by skillfully caring for all beings with boundless wisdom.\n \nSeven Points of Mind Training\n \n1. The Preliminaries\n2. The Main Practice\n3. Transforming Adversity into the Path of Enlightenment\n4. Applying the Practice Throughout Your Entire Life\n5. The Measure of Mind Training\n6. The Commitments of Mind Training\n7. The Precepts of Mind Training\n \nVen. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche is a holder of the complete Buddhist Nyingma lineage of study and practice from the basic teachings of mindfulness to the most advanced meditation techniques of Dzogchen. Rinpoche has been a spiritual friend and resident of the PBC Tennessee for over 30 years. Together with his brother, Ven. Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche, he founded Padmasambhava Buddhist Center in the late 1980\u2019s and is the principal director and teacher of Padmasambhava Buddhist Center International.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.570
 How I can know how my practice of looking practice is going by good. Good. How I know. That is what

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:15.130
 it is. That is what it is. So how I know, we don't have to ask anyone how is my practice of looking

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:21.560
 or my practice is going home. How you think my practice is going home? We don't have to. We don't

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:27.940
 have to ask to the dreams. We don't have to ask to the vision. We don't have to ask to any other

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.980
 sign. Ask your heart.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 Our heart. Our practice. We even in the dreams are not always reliable. But our heart is reliable.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 You have to ask to our heart. Or our heart.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:54.790
 And today, here, here, said, "It is ruthless and you look to that field." Field. All the teachings

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:03.190
 has, all the teachings, almost all the teachings are the same. That is my rapid translation. Of

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.000
 course, you have good translation as well.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.190
 So that means all the teachings of the graduate teacher, what I have done many years, as I said, 45

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:22.710
 years. Its purpose is the same. There are so many teachings. So many pages, so many pages of

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.000
 teachings.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:34.440
 The purpose is the same. What that purpose is? To remove our obscurities, our ego claims and remove

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.000
 our nature.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:48.030
 Also, sometimes a teacher says, "To tame our own mind. To tame T-A-N-E." Or, "To display our mind."

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.000
 That's the purpose. All the teachings.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:02.640
 That's the purpose of the T-T-T. That is my inner, super-myer of teaching. And that is where the

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:14.090
 inner purpose is. The same. To subdue the ego-greeting. To subdue the negative emotions and reverse

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.000
 our nature.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:25.630
 The nature of the mind. A great common peace. That's it. That's our books, our teachings. In the T-

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:33.000
T-T field, in the X center, how many decades after that? The X center, the Y center, the X center,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 the X center, all 110.
