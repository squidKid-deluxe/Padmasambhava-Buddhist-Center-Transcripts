00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:24.470
 Thank you very much everyone. Again, we continue to know what we are going through and the

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.960
 teachings

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:33.200
 of the Bodhisattvamuni and the Bariguluri is the highlight by the Shabji Dinnurukhi will follow me

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:41.200
 with those teachings. And so again in that frame we are going again three nobles.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:50.240
 In the beginning noble as foundations, middle noble as principal, and a concluding or third noble

00:00:50.240 --> 00:01:00.000
 is a concluding pinem. Those are three nobles. And so those three we're going again in order to

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.440
 follow and reflect the teaching as in the teaching said and I mentioned so many times and we again

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:15.040
 all heard so many times and reactivated our motivation. A beautiful motivation of the duo

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:22.320
 and appreciations and vastness motivation of the bodhisattvas. Beautiful motivation of the

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:30.640
 Vedayana teachings. Five perfect, all five perfect, all three Vedas, all three Kayas,

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:37.760
 according your understanding and realization. Bring up those realizations and with those beautiful

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:44.960
 intention and beautiful understanding realization then we reflect the teachings. So now first is

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:53.200
 again we're going through the first novels. First novel is the motivation and which is I

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.920
 highlighted

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:02.000
 joy and appreciation and bodhicitta and then as well as the Vedayana motivation of the

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:10.320
 joy in appreciation, bodhicitta and the devotions. Those are I highlighted but beside that again

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:19.520
 another very important which is poor renunciation thoughts. We went through those last time or

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:26.560
 during this our retreat. I went through now again you notice poor renunciation thoughts.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:33.920
 Poor renunciation thoughts again if I highlight that precious human body, precious life,

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:47.040
 impermanence, cause and effects is inevitable because it will bring the result or the fruit

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:55.440
 inevitable. If cause and the contraction there, there is inevitably a result will come.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:01.920
 That's it. That is the logic. That is where the system of this mundane world going.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:10.080
 Everything is cause and effect and cause and effect are totally connected exactly as it is.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:16.320
 Cause if the cause is something different, effect or the result is something that will never happen

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.320
.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:26.400
 Cause and condition whatever that is it will bring exactly a result, result and cause and

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.600
 also that cause and condition will not going to transfer something different or something

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:39.520
 change that. That is same the external this phenomena existing that is the way

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:47.040
 mentally whatever it is also the same thing. So therefore be smart and be thoughtful and

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:54.160
 become mindfulness of the cause and effect and is that is what means cause and effort we should

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:02.960
 we should follow that and then samsara has difficulty in troubles and challenges. Those

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:09.440
 are the four points with the day with those reflecting those thoughts really joy and

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:16.480
 appreciation and bodhicitta. So those and now I'm going to go again with the bodhicitta.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:25.760
 Bodhicitta I can explain those of us divisions different divisions but summarizing bodhicitta

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:34.080
 into two we'll encounter the practices two and which is wishing bodhicitta and actualizing

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:44.240
 bodhicitta. So that is two bodhicittas. First is wishing bodhicitta and the wishing bodhicitta is

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:52.000
 how we activate the wishing bodhicitta that is through the poor boundless practices.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:00.720
 We're going to activate it by the poor boundlesses wishing bodhicitta and that poor boundless of

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:01.120
 course

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:07.040
 we went through yesterday and we all know it's not just I went yesterday and then you

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:13.760
 on that time only knew that's not I'm talking we knew that we received the teaching we went through

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:20.320
 all those so many times so many great masters one after another and that is teaching of

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:27.680
 entirely buddhas mayana teaching this is really what it is and so therefore again we went and

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:36.640
 again I'm going to list those four boundlesses. Boundless love, boundless compassion and boundless

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:47.120
 joy or the rejoice and boundless equanimities that is those are known as poor boundless again I

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:54.560
 mentioned yesterday the why is called boundless boundless because the subject level is boundless

00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:04.240
 object level is boundless benefit or result is boundless therefore it is known as boundless

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:15.840
 what that means subject level means our mind has no boundaries no borders our mind is boundless

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:26.880
 it's infinite so this love and kind is coming from our mind or this poor boundless are coming

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:33.120
 from our mind it's not for coming from outside we have to collect together and put that and then

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:41.920
 try to get send that out no it's all is from our mind that according to buddha teaching

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:55.520
 mind is infinite mind has no deep the mind has no kind of borders it's deepest ever we can imagine

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:05.280
 it is the vastness ever we can imagine it's our mind your mind and my mind that's our mind

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:16.400
 mind is more vast than the sky mind is more deeper than the deepest oceans as I said there's no

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:16.400
 deep

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:28.400
 deeper that you can make that is the mind this mind is filled with the richness of those qualities

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:36.560
 beautiful qualities those enlightenment energies are filled with that effort filled with that

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:46.080
 vastness we're revealing that radio so therefore the subject way is coming from the mind

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:55.200
 is boundless for that reason it's called boundless now this time by the teaching of the greatest

00:07:55.200 --> 00:08:03.280
 teacher by brother hetmani or the great masters we are opening that boundaries without any border

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:10.800
 to the to all objects to the object of talking about where we're going to project that that

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:19.600
 boundless loving kindness normally what we do that love love is for our relatives our close ones

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:25.760
 our loved ones that's what we call loved ones our loved ones when we say that our loved ones

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:33.120
 there is someone that we don't know that indirectly apply that meaning to I have to my loved ones

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:40.720
 but this time we're not going to make that border we're not going to make that distraction because

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:48.480
 by our ego clings clings we're going to break that boundary wall that we created

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:54.560
 from the big and less time cut that iron wall between us and the others we're going to break

00:08:54.560 --> 00:09:02.800
 that we're going to illuminate that love and kindness powers as billion the sunlight or billion

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:12.400
 sunlight of trillions of suns radiating to the old living beings beings to all the living beings

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:20.480
 therefore it is boundless an object of sentient beings again number of the sentient beings limited

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:27.920
 limitless as I said yesterday again I don't I mean it's not something I'm sorry that I'm saying

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:28.160
 this

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:33.840
 I said that because you don't know that we all know that they call the ticket there is no numbers

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:34.080
 of

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:39.920
 sentient beings but our loving kindness for the boundless this poor boundless going to all those

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:49.120
 living beings why because they all struggle they all struggle with their emotions as soon as there

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:57.280
 is emotions there is karma that caused but the karma and emotion caused with the result consecrates

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:06.800
 challenge in a struggle for that reason they all need help they all need support including myself

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:14.880
 and ourself they all need so therefore it's spreading out of the power of the boundless

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:23.680
 poor boundless to all the beings therefore object level is boundless the result or the benefit of

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:32.560
 that according to the teaching it is boundless it's not just the benefit of the one person

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:38.880
 two individuals three individuals or hundred four hundred we're talking numerous beings

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:48.320
 reaching out to that to all the beings truly we are making the meaning of our lives we are making

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:55.120
 the impressions we have new dimension understanding by the kindness completion of the buddha we're

00:10:55.120 --> 00:11:02.800
 raising up something great wisdom that never had before in our lifetimes really completely thinking

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:11.200
 of all beings reading that energy from the pure heart there is nothing any negativities

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:20.320
 it's truly pure it's pure from the beginning pure in the middle and pure all the way

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:28.960
 to all the living beings how beautiful it is how divine really i'm not just a joke can't say that

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:38.880
 that is divine that is holy that is the most holiest ones that is truly powerful

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:47.600
 and it's good heart powerful good heart therefore result according to the teaching

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:55.520
 is the not just there's no boundaries what can't result the merit in the teaching is too merit

00:11:55.520 --> 00:12:04.240
 the accumulation merit verse the merits all are completely coming

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:10.720
 and with that happen what it does for us it's purifying the obscurations

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:20.720
 negative it is and calm us negative emotions or in the teaching said the knowledge obscurations

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:28.240
 and emotion obscuring to obscuring we knocking down we are really trembling them they never did

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:35.840
 that before in our lifetimes now we're shaking up their roots their identities the same time

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:43.680
 is the benefiting to the others the ripple effect well stay until we reach enlightenment

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:51.040
 or reach ripple effort of the benefit of that that well see that merit until we reach enlightenment

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:57.360
 until all the living beings are getting enlightened it's an effect it is a ripple effect it is like

00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:04.320
 waves of the energies are started it started from the boneless and projected the boneless

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:12.240
 it is going to stay for a long time long time after they reach enlightenment so therefore

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:19.360
 this poor boneless is so powerful again in the teaching said why as i said the other day did

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:22.640
 the vision both did that when we put that in the practices

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:34.160
 that is the poor boneless poor boneless really those tungi practices that is known as practices

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:40.080
 of the vision both each other or in other words if i use terminology exercising of the

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:49.040
 wishing both each others now i talk really about of course we hope you all know though that but

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:56.400
 again i thought i reminded this this because it's about that the teachings always in the teaching

00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:03.280
 mentioned why we do love to all the sentient beings why we feel the compassion for all the

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:09.120
 sentient beings why feel the rejoice or joy when they have good experience the good things

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:17.040
 why we should be equanimated to all the sentient beings the first we talk about the loving kindness

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:25.200
 and then compassion because the reason why we do this one of the principle reasons according to

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:37.840
 Buddhism that you know that all living beings be our dear parents all living beings

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:47.280
 every living beings being our dear parents or dear friends once upon a time one way the other

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:54.960
 even many times many times even only the sentient beings can become our best parent

00:14:54.960 --> 00:15:04.480
 so many lifetimes one after another all best friends so if they are coordinated in Buddhism

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:12.320
 that all the parents particularly they be our mothers mothers and mothers according generally

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:21.120
 ever readily parents are very kind to all of us that is what in the Buddhist teaching

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:29.840
 in my energy always parents are very kind always most of the time of course parents are not perfect

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:39.200
 nor we are perfect we are all the sentient beings but they are doing their best they did their best

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:46.960
 to us throughout the time for example this lifetime if we think of our this lifetime of parents

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:55.760
 parents we are here simply to tell we are here because of our parents we are in doubt this time

00:15:55.760 --> 00:16:04.640
 in a zoom announce to a window retreats a parent with all the parent we're not going to do this

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:12.800
 this we know what we were learning through whatever you receive the teachings from great masters

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:22.960
 that not going to happen and parents are not there therefore we have to be thankful

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:32.560
 we have great teachers of that that and then in Buddhism again i know i'm a general general i

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:39.120
 know you know with these modern times parents are kind of little bit issues all these many people

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:47.040
 kind of talk that very issue of the parents but every really think carefully stay in mind the more

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:54.640
 kind of in the economy they stay there take carefulness we call the percentages percentage

00:16:54.640 --> 00:17:03.040
 that's what we do always percentage hundred percent of thing kind of the parents i'm sure

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:11.360
 it is eighty percent seventy percent maybe twenty percent thirty percent they didn't do well

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:19.040
 but that true seventy percent that is i mean in what in the normal people talk that

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:27.200
 seventy percent is a landslide vector is it's true that's what we talk everyone talks that

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:35.600
 land slides so that is the biggest at the portion of the percentage how much they help

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:44.560
 all other could be they 80 percent they did support so 20 percent maybe mistakes some mistakes

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:53.920
 but we think ourselves too how we do we are perfect how much mistakes we did

00:17:53.920 --> 00:18:04.640
 in our lives until now mostly we all grown-ups were educated went college and the university

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:13.440
 degrees and all these things and how much mistakes that we did our self so parent

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:22.480
 also is a sentient beings they're struggling with the emotions so therefore kind of reflecting

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:28.800
 thought for more carefully and then we have to be really more kind of grateful that in a normal

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:34.960
 time again have i said when we go to the restaurants when we buy the coffees or the cheese

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:35.360
 something

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:41.920
 something you pay the money you get the money but they give you ask coffee and we say thank you

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:49.680
 thank you and they give maybe coffee with when you're taking out coffee with with nothing papers

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:56.880
 they will give or i want extra nothing nothing paper nothing paper and they get again nothing

00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:04.080
 what i i'm good i'm very greatly appreciate it thank you so much again you say we say one extra

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:13.840
 thank you giving coffee that you paid money and just asking them what extra nothing we said extra

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:21.760
 kind of like strongly or i greatly appreciated that that and the parents are not just that

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:31.840
 truly they help us so much in the buddhist and what's at least the poor principles that we can

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:42.640
 highlight what bad did to us first and those are first is they give us this body it's the first

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:51.120
 kindness of the provider of this body second in the teaching said they give us life

00:19:53.600 --> 00:20:02.560
 l a s l i f i believe they give us life second first they give our body

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:08.160
 second they give us life third they provided all necessities

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:26.160
 necessities fourth they show us the world this world w o r l d world they show us the four great

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:35.680
 kindness they really did and that's what we are here fourth they give us life this fresh life

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:47.520
 is provided by our parents particularly mother carried us in her womb for nine months or maybe

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:57.200
 even ten months or whatever the long period is getting heavy and heavy and heavy but never she's

00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:05.920
 bored and tired and complaining she's so always excited happy joy and my baby is coming that she's

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:14.720
 just smiling thinking of that and all that is true that she's going with and all the necessity

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:20.240
 any you might go into the expert doctors and this and that ask her how to do this and that

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:27.600
 and that's what mother is doing and father is true kind of almost busy we talk at all our baby is

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:33.440
 coming all these things so they completely nourish him prepared the area there and then our comic

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:44.000
 polls we came out but when we came out we are completely in in couple in couples we can't do

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:52.960
 anything and everything is completely dependent on our balance we are in the teaching said we are

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:53.200
 not

00:21:53.200 --> 00:22:00.400
 dead because we are crying we're not of total life because we don't can't function anything

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:09.760
 that completely in cover to person and only indication of our pain and feeling or not is

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:19.520
 crimes that is our communication lens moment she get we came out of the wombs the parents

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:26.400
 and mother picked up immediately and the glass clean so beautiful white and then touching to her

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:36.720
 face her belly and the most subtle part of the hip her bodies and father too truly so excited soft

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:44.640
 but everything every parents that time dropped we won't be like if they throw away that we want to

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:53.760
 lie true or not so therefore their kindness of giving us life they give us lives so therefore

00:22:53.760 --> 00:23:02.400
 provided body and provided they give us this life precious lives then they provided all necessities

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:12.080
 and every time even before we born those couple of parents are buying the toys tools and those

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:19.600
 baby uh those carrots one up and a blanket and all those organized this and all these beautiful

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:25.040
 things when we have a little bit grown up or something then they buy all those toys action

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:31.680
 figures one after another and when we are survival three or six years ago i mean this rich country

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:40.560
 then they had a completely kind of comfort room for their toys toys how much they really

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:48.000
 lost how much they did kindness all that they spent everything else and not just that at

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:55.840
 only same time now they're showing the world to us helping us and do this do that don't do that

00:23:55.840 --> 00:24:02.480
 where it is good at this and even many times they just can't reach everything they provided

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:11.200
 and even they sure told us how to walk how to speak how to go bubbles on hippies those are all

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:19.920
 provided because of their love their kindness and compassion for those reasons called in buddha

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:27.360
 teaching parents so kind these are not just only one parent every parent most of them do

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:35.440
 even the animal world when we look to the birds how much those birds are busy trying to feed

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:42.880
 preparing for their nastas and feed when the baby bone prepare feed there's just one up another and

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:48.480
 you look to everyone i mean you know this modern days we can know so easy so therefore

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:55.680
 it's called all the parents are so kind and now therefore now i receive the teaching

00:24:55.680 --> 00:25:00.720
 and i understand of the of the meaning of the value and importance of loving kindness and

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:07.920
 compassion and our parents those kind of parents struggle with the emotions struggle with the

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:14.800
 karmas and their consequences so therefore we need compassion we need the compassion we need

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:22.240
 love and kindness we need the joys and joys and we need like equanimity so that's what

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:29.680
 really in the teaching says that's what because all the parents are being so kind and so nice

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:38.240
 now we have to return back there great kindness repeat that and therefore then they belong in the

00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:47.920
 body and support it to all that way everywhere every can do that is the part of the body cells

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:56.000
 and this so therefore so this this this body is so important and loving kindness in all that's

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:02.400
 so so important and again as i say the loving kindness that this loving kindness or the body

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:12.320
 together is simple way to explain it is it's good heart have the good heart good intention and that

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:20.800
 is again it's kind of motivation is it is then loving kindness the compassion rejoice and joy

00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:29.040
 and equanimity so that is the one that is the vision body that is now i talk with some few stories

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:36.320
 of this power of the loving kindness and again of all these stories many of you know already this

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:44.080
 but i'm going to talk three stories now the the respect and appreciation and good thought

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:53.120
 thought of the good thought and good heart heart to others has big powers in the teaching

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:59.920
 set because we we love to each other when you do help and support to each other and it has really

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:07.840
 big power it will remove and glorify the obscurations and obstacles this is in the

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:14.400
 teaching said that once upon a time i mean is also i i think it a bit is happening a bit

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:21.200
 and it made it many times those big viewers don't have bridges in ancient times

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:31.760
 ancient and they what they use they crossing by the horse or they by their their own uh crossing

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:39.520
 by the feet feet and and then also there is the fundamental the method they're going through the

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:48.640
 boat b-o-a-t i think boat so they're going boats but intubate there is a boat called the leather

00:27:48.640 --> 00:28:00.400
 boat leather boat and the l-e-a-t-h-e-l leather i believe leather and then boat is b-o-a-t

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:07.680
 boat leather boat so leather boat is quite popular it's a young skin young skin is the matter of

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:08.480
 that

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:15.920
 and it is also very durable it's very light light you can carry and you can save that

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:26.240
 so they say that the boat leather called it they say the corner so leather boat boat so now this

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:35.840
 sailor has six passengers and so and then including himself is seven it makes seven

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:43.280
 so now they're crossing the river quite big rivers but here they are they this sailor

00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:48.640
 didn't kind of thought that at the very beginning but you know when they reach in the middle of

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:48.880
 that

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:54.320
 river he's told to everyone and there is i think

00:28:54.320 --> 00:29:07.920
 five monks or maybe it's eight passengers uh six monks one messenger and himself

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:15.040
 so maybe the seller himself so add passengers add passengers so now when they got them in the

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:15.520
 middle

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:24.640
 of the road middle of the river the seller said oh oh said to them said boat is too heavy i think

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:31.520
 one of you have to jump out those who know the swimming have to jump out and otherwise i would

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:40.480
 jump out out any one one person you come up and hold this what's called row to row the boat boat

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:51.360
 and so now we need the seller say that to to them and it turned out no one knows how to swim

00:29:52.880 --> 00:30:03.520
 and no one also know how to row row the boat boat so so then he said then we all will think

00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:13.040
 if nobody jump we all will think that so this messenger thought oh everyone sings

00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:25.600
 that all will die die so now if i'm going to jump and if i died i will save these seven people

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:31.760
 i'm going to jump he thought he's not really practicing according to the story he's not

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:38.080
 necessarily practicing but he's a good heart a gentleman appreciating your love to the others

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:47.200
 carrying thoughts so suddenly he jumped at the river even though he don't know the swimming

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:54.880
 he jumped because of the power of in the teaching said the power of his good heart and good

00:30:54.880 --> 00:31:02.320
 intention even he don't know the swimming he able to come out of the river to the other shores

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:11.360
 and all others said and this rainbow light came came that's the really teaching said the power

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:18.800
 of compassion power of the caring thought for the others with good hearts and there is another

00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:27.360
 story that also in the teaching said ancient time true mother and the daughters are close to the

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:35.680
 rivers they're not there's no break there's no more both are crossing hold hands target the whole

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:43.760
 ending helping hands are targeted they cross the rivers and the water currents is really strong

00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:51.120
 can it strong the mother thought water this looks like this water is going to carry

00:31:51.120 --> 00:32:00.320
 path but i wish i i wish my daughter can go through this and then to other show even i

00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:07.200
 carried with river i don't care but i want my daughter to be like why she was really thinking

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:16.720
 that so much my mother's and don't tell the same things i i wish my mother can go through this

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:22.960
 through this river even i carried i don't care i carried this river but i want mother herself

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:32.160
 to go other show really thinking of that because that's strong genuine affection and loving kind

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:41.280
 talk to each other other they both are dark in the teaching said the moment they died they

00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:50.160
 told the birth in the duchita heavens duchita heavens heavens so therefore the power of the

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:59.120
 loving kindness to each other and that brought them to the higher realm immediately the result

00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:06.800
 higher than rebirths so this is the one that really the known as bodhicaka good heart power

00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:14.160
 of the good house now i'm going to talk that when we put this poor boneless practices into more

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:24.080
 kind of powerful powerful practices what in the teaching said trying to develop the poor

00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:32.000
 intentions poor thoughts all poor brains maybe another poor brains first is

00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:41.440
 drift loving genuine this compassion or slowing kindness for all the living beings and make all

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:51.280
 such as in this following first pray may all living beings have happiness and cause of happiness

00:33:52.800 --> 00:34:02.560
 really genuinely thinking from the heart and pray sing that word and pray that may all living

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:10.480
 beings have that happiness and the cause of happiness and what is the cause of happiness

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:18.880
 i said that yesterday too cause of happiness the other day we mentioned ten virtues ten virtues

00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:28.080
 ten virtues it starts from the identity from that from ten virtues come from the loving kind as a

00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:36.560
 compassion and the wisdom because of from that heart and enough reflecting the virtues ten virtues

00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:46.560
 three by the body poor by the speech and three by mind ten virtues ten virtues is a cause

00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:55.200
 that good intention of loving kind is a comparison of wisdom and ten virtues action that is cause

00:34:55.200 --> 00:35:03.840
 of the happiness so that one is a cause or there is a result and reaching that sincerity that

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:13.280
 may all living beings have happiness and cause of happiness that is post intention second

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:23.600
 intentions may all living beings immediately right now they have the happiness and cause of

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:32.000
 happiness kind of reactivating that first prayer reactivated that intention kind of more intensify

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:40.720
 may all living beings have the happiness the cause of happiness right now right this moment

00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:50.560
 sincerely wishing and praying that that is called second intentions when we activated

00:35:50.560 --> 00:36:01.200
 this vision body third intention is may i have the capabilities to create it to create it the

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:11.040
 cause of happiness and happiness for all living beings may i have that that is known as intention

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:19.280
 with commitments beautiful intention with commitment in the aspirations practice what is

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:28.480
 and the fourth one may all the buddhas the body self enlighten me have blessed me that i have that

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:37.440
 capabilities in their presence you are or we are saying that so those are known as poor intentions

00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:46.720
 that activated more wishing mode i use another example of the the loving kindness

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:52.480
 but that you can do same thing with the computations may all living beings have

00:36:52.480 --> 00:37:01.360
 happiness sorry a plea from the sufferance and cause of sufferance cause of sufferance

00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:10.720
 i said already yesterday what are the other days but it is the anger attachment jealous

00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:20.880
 arrogance those are the front runners of the cause of suffering behind is ego-clinging

00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:30.000
 ignorance they are standing behind and actively sending those negative emotions then it created

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:36.880
 the word action negative karma negative karmas are known as ten known virtues

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:44.960
 and we went those last time and again you know that that is negative karma that is cause of

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:55.120
 sufferance these two are negative negative karma negative emotions are cause of suffering truth

00:37:57.040 --> 00:38:06.880
 that cause bring the result as suffering truth so again do same prayer of that intention poor

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:17.760
 intention poor prayers with that again it's calm with a relaxed manner peaceful manner calm

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:26.240
 peaceful openness relaxing hurry gentle man pray there and the same thing with the joy or the joys

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:36.480
 and then same thing with the equanimics those are known as the protein the poor boneless more

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:44.080
 in the active status which is practice of the wishing both each other then when we have good

00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:52.960
 foundation good of this poor boneless practice certainly in our heart then again how we activate

00:38:52.960 --> 00:39:02.560
 the wishing both each other as i said the other day is that we all are ego that attitude come

00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:11.360
 that is called tungni practice first we all ego second we are tungni practices third others are

00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:20.720
 more dear than me or myself those are known as again once we have the good strong foundations

00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:28.320
 of the poor boneless that's how they do the great practice but also if you like to do before that

00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:33.680
 during the poor boneless practice is excellent it's not something that you can do that those

00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:42.080
 are good practices we all equal equal means similar as the equanimities we all equal many

00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:49.040
 of us we all equal what the great master part will you say that equal means equal men practices

00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:56.240
 for example now we in the cold weather cold weather in the snow storms snow storms and

00:39:56.240 --> 00:40:02.640
 there is not much to really in it here but one individual has a nice blanket a big nice blanket

00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:09.440
 not just the only way that individual is but equally kind of wear that blanket to everyone

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:16.560
 under that blanket that is equal you're equally thinking everyone and you are also included

00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:24.400
 ourselves also included that is example that in many times also we were good to have good

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:30.720
 friend what they said oh we will be good friend whether we are happy or whether we are troubles

00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:39.520
 we will be good friend we're not going to change our friendships we can't and what in the teaching

00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:49.200
 said that in the teaching said what in what the great master problem when you say it f f f f we are
