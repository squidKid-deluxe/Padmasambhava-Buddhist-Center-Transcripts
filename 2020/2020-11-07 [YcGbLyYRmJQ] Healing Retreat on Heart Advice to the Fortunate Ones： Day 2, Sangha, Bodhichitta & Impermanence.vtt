00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.600
 Thank you very much, everyone, and for participating and coming. Thank you very much. Again, today

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.920
's very special day, according to where the Buddha is the calendar.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.990
 Today is the Thavak Phuchit, who is at the Synod of Heaven, which is considered one of the very

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.200
 important marriage holiday.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:33.400
 We do some virtuous activity, Dharma practices. Whatever we do, we reflect our compassion, loving

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.600
 kindness and thought to all others, according to our capabilities.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:49.790
 According to the teaching, it is really powerful. It will multiply, break, very beautiful, come to

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:59.670
 time, it is so season of timing, the situation is so good according to teaching. So therefore,

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.090
 again, we have a great opportunity to again be targeted in discussing the teaching of the Buddha

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.600
 Dharma according to our common abilities, not just in discussing, but also in trying to observe

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.520
 that in our heart and practices and kind of activating our Dharma practice.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.750
 This is a wonderful, which is beautiful, and which is really one of the very great things we can do

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:20.380
 in our lives. There are many other great things, but this is something that we touch to our heart,

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.760
 our goal, our very beings, our own being, which is very, very special.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:32.850
 And with that, again, bring more joy and appreciation. I bring joy and appreciation to ourselves

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.010
 and feel good while we are doing that. I think we can feel happy with that, and that we need

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:44.270
 practice too. That is Dharma too. Bring joy and happy with our deeds, our attitude, our motivation

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.000
 while we are doing that.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.240
 And we are in practice, it is wonderful, beautiful. It is not just making those words like I am

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.760
 making them. It is true, it is a really beautiful, special, pure in appreciation with content heart

00:01:52.760 --> 00:02:02.000
 of the love and completion.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.090
 God knows anybody who can describe with that, that is not good. It is very wonderful, it is special

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:14.820
. And of course all the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, every enlightenment will be appreciated, and there

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.000
 will be acknowledge to our deeds, and we can keep on that.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.860
 With that thought, and then bodhisattva, as we all know, again, and our gathering towards it,

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:33.000
 practice is the purpose, the benefit of all human beings according to Mahayana practitioners.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.110
 When we take the bodhisattva, we think to everyone trying to help and support them, to bring them

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.000
 to the enlightened state. For that very reason, I am really practicing.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.200
 This is absolutely the best upon completion, taking over all living beings. This bodhisattva

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.000
 completion has no boundaries, that we all know that.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.760
 So extend our love and completion and pray to every living being. We hear that sincerely from our

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.000
 heart and the mind, and we do that. That is again so powerful, so special.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.320
 And then also then we deliver, it will make us one of the peace makers in the world, in a localized

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:22.000
 way. Peace maker, peace started not from outside, it started from our heart, heart, our soul.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.990
 And so bring the peace and harmony to our soul, peace and harmony to our family, peace and harmony

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:38.000
 to our neighbors, our friends in our world. That is how to start peace making.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:45.470
 Peace making has quadruple effects. Peace, we make peace and harmony, and it is wonderful. And with

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:51.280
 those towards, and again we are going to activate our realization of the three Vedic states, of

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.000
 beauty states.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.010
 Like the Vadiyana teaching, always what I said in the Vadiyana teaching, all the master's view,

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:05.000
 everything is beauty state, even though we don't really see like this moment, but reality is pure.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 So at least lining up our motivation to all that direction, to that everything is beauty states,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 whether a form, whether a song, whether a mind in space, many of you already know those things.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.200
 So it's not just a kind of, leave that intellectual state is only sharp or somewhere else behind

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.000
 scene, but activating that is known as practicing.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.550
 That is really known as practice. So that is our kind of responsibility in a way, so therefore

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.000
 react to any of that.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:59.530
 With those towards, then we go to the teaching of the great, great master, his own union in that

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:06.000
 teaching we have followed. So again, we went yesterday, what we went on this, we went yesterday,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 there were about seven of the lines of this half advice, seven lines.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:15.560
 And which is, again, a reality. And do not mistake about the result of the virtues and virtues,

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.000
 actions.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:25.430
 So that means, do not mistake, that means what? Don't ignore. Don't ignore. Don't kind of skip the

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:26.000
 wave.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:35.580
 Every action has resolved consequences. Whether it's good, whether it's small, we're really trying

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:40.000
 to be very thoughtful. Mindfulness.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:48.460
 If we do the mindfulness with our actions, then it has very virtues, because I think we know what

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.000
 means virtues, what means the un-writuals.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:01.710
 So every action, not kind of like naively ignoring and kind of like just kind of broken, if we can

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.000
 keep on that, so speak.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:14.580
 Even the smallest actions can have hugely resolved, as we know. Smallest actions, whether it is the

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:22.320
 smallest, the negativities, best upon the ignorance and attachment and anger and self-emotional

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:28.000
 action, it has resolved, big result, according to the Buddha's teaching.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:35.450
 Even the smallest actions of the rituals, something barely be here activities, nice smile to the

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:42.190
 others, kind of nice welcoming to the other, just a simple word, one second or two minutes or one

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:43.000
 minute.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:51.850
 That action, according to Buddhism, it has really big effect, big helps, help. And that is what in

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:54.000
 the Buddha's teaching, using examples.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:12.720
 Small, the sparking fires, sparking fires can burn the whole city. It starts from a small fire, a

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.000
 small sparking, sparking, or in a small bosom, putting in one big bowl or something.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:25.760
 So it has, it kills or disturbs so many beings. Similarly, medicine, when we take, is not big,

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:36.000
 complex, it is small, but it has meaning, effect, same way that our mind, actions really do that.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:44.150
 And then of course you all know that virtuous activity or non-virtuous activities. Again, being

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:52.150
 practiced on earth is not just a leap of knowledge on the shelf or behind somewhere, mind or on the

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:53.000
 brain.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:00.300
 I have activated that as much as you can. Oh we can, I'm not just a you, we all should, really

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:06.000
 activated that. That is known as practices. You can be happy with that.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:15.790
 But I'm doing, doing, should dedicate it, then merit, that is merit to all the beings. And somehow

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:21.000
 is not acting exactly, I lined our practice, even the smallest of things.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:31.280
 And we notice that immediately the purify. Purify, clean way. Shouldn't stay that strain, that

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:41.000
 shadow in our mental states, or in the Buddha teaching, alliance, then it goes deeper, deeper,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
 clean way as much as we can.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:51.100
 And when stress, more can come in Facebook, you really see it. It is known as practitioners. So

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:56.000
 here, the great master, he is the only individual, he said, not don't mistakes.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.550
 We shouldn't mistake our actions. Can't be ignoring something is all, even if it is a kind of

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:07.000
 negative video or not, good at giving, oh that's okay, that's okay, it's too small.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:14.470
 We shouldn't do that, every cane. We shouldn't ignore it. Even the smallest things, or that's too

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:19.000
 small, what has big deals with this. No, it has big deals.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:37.220
 Now whatever our attitude, the mind, our collective, it really has big impacts. That Buddha, the

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:38.480
 greatest feature of Buddha, Master, Guru, Bhai Ma, some of you, they all use the examples, those

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:39.720
 poisons, the fires, medicine, all those use the examples, trying to ring that bell in our heart and

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.000
 mind, our brain.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:50.560
 Brain is true, that is what here says. So all those actions. And then with this, next one is then,

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:56.000
 in the Vedic Anatici, we went yesterday to the, then next one is this.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:07.450
 This is his own Dhunurubji, listed whole permanent wealth, whole permanent wealth, what should be

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:11.040
 regarded in this pulse, known as everlasting wealth of the practic note, that should be regarded as

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:14.000
 indispensable, indispensable.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:23.000
 This whole wealth is on Dhunurubji listed. This wealth is so important.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:30.110
 We will have to make our practice more rich, more performant, more developed, and more like

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:32.000
 advanced to the part.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:41.180
 These four are so important. They are necessary. They are the life force of the practitioners. They

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:49.000
 are the life force. Somehow, if we are missing this wealth, then we become poor, spiritually poor.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.760
 And then we become poorer and poorer. If we reduce that, lower and lower, all this, this

00:10:54.760 --> 00:11:00.000
 understanding, this lower dhun, lower dhun, we become poorer and poorer.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:07.530
 Then maybe we have to find the bank, what to call it, bankruptcies, spiritual bankruptcies. Bank

00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:09.000
ruptcies.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:17.100
 We really don't. And then, many times that happens. Practitioners. Not just only now, but in Chind

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:18.000
ang too.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:26.810
 Then they are thinking something, they have a big thing, such as a Dzogchin, Mahamudara, Zalong,

00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:31.000
 and Tomodekara, looking to those things, that really they will miss the point.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:37.350
 This is the wealth. Whether you practice in the Dzogchin, whether you practice in Mahamudara,

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:42.000
 whether you practice in Tomodekara, we need this wealth.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:50.220
 And we don't have this wealth. Our practice of Dzogchin practices, they become dry. Dry has no

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:54.000
 monsters, no nutrition.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:03.560
 So therefore, here is the everlasting wealth. If we have that, always the practice of Dzogchin, Mah

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:10.000
amudara, Zalong, all our biological practices become so rich, so fulfillment.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:17.280
 It's really so rural. And if we don't have these things, these qualities, wealth. Wealth, as well

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:21.000
 as these coordinate factors, are inevitable.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:29.160
 If we don't follow that, then we become, of course, shallow practitioners. And it becomes almost

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.000
 like failures.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:37.870
 So therefore, we like to leave fulfillment as successful, as great masters in Dzogchin, as great

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:44.000
 masters in popular images, as great masters in Maharaya past.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:50.000
 This wealth is, this is the wealth, all those great masters.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 Among that, we discussed yesterday, the teacher, the root teacher, went through little details of,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 I mean, you know already, we discussed those things before, and I'm sure you know already this.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 Teacher is, they are divided into four different teachers, four groups of teachers.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:27.120
 For ourselves, our capabilities, most of us, only beings. That means we are with emotions, with ego

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:31.000
 clings, with dualities.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:39.510
 We will not have capability, according to the teaching, capabilities to receive the teaching from

00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:41.000
 body circles.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:50.540
 What that means, those individually, or practitioners, who have any positive meaning, positive

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:59.850
 meaning, or even the accumulation part, education part, those great masters, we won't have the

00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:01.000
 capability to see.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:08.530
 Maybe there's also not really many that we can meet. Maybe there is some, but according to the

00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:17.000
 Buddha teaching, realization is kept as quiet and peaceful, as a stone of the depths of oceans.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 They're not bragging, showing. Even they're bragging, showing something, we won't trust them.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:32.670
 Or even say that openly we won't trust them, we will confront them. Therefore, our capabilities is

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:41.000
 among those four teachers, the perfect, good, ordinary teacher, which has those qualifications,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000
 great master, great teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni, high might, and indicated.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 And we have all those teachers. That is what really we should contact.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:59.000
 Use that and we can then add one's to the part. Have those. Those things.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:08.000
 So, and that is how we respect, teaching we respect with appreciation, joy, devotion.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:18.760
 And also preciousness. Preciousness. And then, in the teaching, as I said yesterday, we hang out

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:23.000
 with others, what the teacher said.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 Respect as kings, or leaders. Respect as our dear uncles. Respect our dear fathers.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:42.560
 Respect as our dear mothers. And precious and preserving honor, and keep, and respect as our eye,

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:44.000
 the eye, two eyes.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 And respect and honor in life, keep life as our heart.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 Our growth of the spiritual realization is very much dependent upon, to the qualified teachers.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.710
 Until we have some high realization. Then, of course, we can advance as teachers, one after another

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:04.000
.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000
 But however, in the Buddha teaching, he said, what Buddha said, he said,

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:17.000
 "Until you read the enlightenment, for complete Buddha would never give up the teaching."

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:25.740
 Always is. "Until you read the enlightenment, you should contact with the qualified teacher or the

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:27.000
 teacher."

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:33.000
 Of course, the qualified teacher. Contact them. It's so important. So spacious.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:42.650
 There is no single Buddha, or no single Buddhist surface. It is the realization without the teacher

00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:43.000
.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:54.260
 Everyone really has realization and become the Buddha, because of the connecting to the qualified

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:55.000
 teaching,

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:01.000
 and following the instructions, and keep instructions in the heart, and following them.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:07.000
 That's what it really is. So therefore, to keep the connection with joy and appreciation,

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:16.000
 and with respect and prayerfulness, devotion, that is wealth. Spiritual wealth.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:22.780
 If we do this, we will become more richer. It's not something that we are benefiting to the teacher

00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:23.000
.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:31.000
 It includes, you nourish, we nourish ourselves. Read all those great Masters of the Master.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:39.990
 And now too, all those great Masters we call, how in their life story, how they contract to their

00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:41.000
 Masters,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:48.000
 how they preserve, and honor, and contract, and follow, and keep the practices.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:18:00.030
 That is the examples, models of this. So therefore, therefore this is the first trait as is always

00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:01.000
 making.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:08.000
 Making what my teaching says. First trait, first wealth. Somehow when we are missing that,

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:15.000
 we are missing 25% of the wealth, or maybe more.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:23.530
 Generally in the teaching said, when we join the stainless king, when we do the 10th day Burya, 25

00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:24.000
th Burya,

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:30.000
 we join the stainless, which is translated in English, and our book, the stainless king.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:43.000
 The number one of the putting down force, first one is disobeying, disrespectful to the Vaidya Jaya

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:43.000
,

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 or Vaidya master, is the first drawn force.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:54.800
 And we do that, according to Buddhism and Vaidya in our teaching, our spiritual ground is trembling

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:59.000
, shaking, shaking.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:05.000
 That is what I read in this teaching said. So, that is how it is.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:16.090
 And so, that is really about this first one. The next one is, is the next wealth, is love and

00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:20.000
 affection for the Samaya brothers and sisters.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:31.000
 Love and affection for the Samaya brothers. That is second wealth. Second wealth of this teaching.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:38.650
 Generally what, according to Mahayana teaching, of course, all brother teaching is love and

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:40.000
 compassion to others.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:46.600
 It is so important. Because teaching, Buddha's teaching, essence, heart essence teaching, is loving

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:50.000
 kindness, compassion, non-violence, peace.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000
 Peace and non-violence start with compassion, loving kindness.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:02.000
 So, all teaching is love and compassion, best of loving kindness and compassion.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:14.000
 But particularly, Mahayana highlighted compassion. Mahayana teaching highlighted for all the

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.000
 sentient beings without any boundaries.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:26.490
 So therefore, again, of course, all sentient beings have love and affection, according to Mahayana,

00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:28.000
 according to Vaidyanas.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:39.320
 Particularly here, teaching, talking, those who share the same Samayas, same teaching, same

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:41.000
 practices.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:51.000
 That is known as the same, similar Samaya or the same, who share the same Samayas.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:56.000
 Also, whether they are male, whether they are female, or male, no homies.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:05.330
 And as in going about, again, Vaidyana teaching said, there is poor groups of the brothers and

00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:07.000
 sisters.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:13.000
 First one is called general brother and sisters.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:20.000
 The second is known as brother, inner brother and sisters.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:27.000
 And third one is the close brother and sister, third group is.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:37.370
 Fourth group is very intimate brother and sisters. These four are our general brother and sisters,

00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:39.000
 all of them.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:46.000
 The first one is general brother and sisters, who they are.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:55.930
 Now all the sentient beings, as Mahayana, Bodhicata, may all living beings have happiness and the

00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:57.000
 cause of happiness.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:03.440
 And may all living beings, instead of that, maybe in this case, may all our brothers and sisters

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:07.000
 have happiness and the cause of happiness.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:13.000
 Every living being. So all living beings is the general brother and sisters.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:22.090
 In teaching what I said in that, those who all have the Buddha nature, all who have the Buddha

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:26.000
 nature, they are our brothers and sisters.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000
 So that's general brother and sisters.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:38.570
 Then inner brother and sisters, who they, according to teaching, is all the follower of the Buddha,

00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:45.000
 follower of the Buddha, is called inner brother and sisters.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:54.000
 We share all of the same great masters, teaching, the Buddha chapter one, inner brother.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:03.200
 And then, known as, if one is the close brother and sisters, we share the similar worlds and share

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:14.000
 the same mandalas, same practices, same meditations, similar accumulation practices.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:22.000
 Those are known as the close, close connected brothers and sisters.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:31.000
 Then, intimate brothers and sisters, those are, in the teaching, the same teachers, same practices.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:38.250
 And the practice is even the same teaching in one circles, and generally the same mandalas, same

00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:42.000
 time. And this is the empowerment and teachings.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:50.000
 And that's mission, with the instructors. Those are, then, all known as intimate brothers.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:57.750
 And the teachings said, the intimate brother, actually, it's not just the intimate brother and

00:23:57.750 --> 00:24:07.000
 sisters now, but we will accompany them until we reach enlightenment, according to teaching.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:14.000
 And therefore, respect and appreciation, kind, nice to each other, so important.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:20.000
 How they use the examples? As the instability, they have the butter lamb, butter lamb.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:28.940
 And this is intimate brother, they will accompany, accompany, took it there as butter in a week, in

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:31.000
 a fire.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:37.000
 They keep burning, keep lightening, keep illuminating throughout the lifetime.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:48.470
 So therefore, His only Guru will say it, say it, the affection, affection, and affection, yeah,

00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:53.000
 love and affection, to that, that one would say Samayas.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:59.920
 And what else? For example, if we look, think of this, like, now we start talking this, like, the

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:02.000
 potent blue dawn pulse.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:12.000
 When we read this, that praise, what is thought of that? Thought dawn pulse.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:22.980
 And we angrily, angrily criticizing, pointing with the very brother and sisters, it's a thought

00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:25.000
 dawn pulse.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:32.460
 That is, Buddha Sakyaman said, in the poem of the Vedic Dara, or the Sum of the Brothers, or the

00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:34.000
 Great Masters.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:41.290
 So therefore, it is always so, really, this can happen, we can happen these things, nothing really

00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:44.000
 unusual, because we are already sentient beings.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:52.980
 By cleansing and purifying. Also, great teacher, Buddha Sakyaman, gives the perfect tools, or how

00:25:52.980 --> 00:26:00.000
 to clean, how to purify, and how to advance ourselves.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.000
 So, purification practices, so powerful, and so important.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:16.000
 And we keep up that, we have now 50% wealth, being tagged, 50%, all in tags.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 And the next one is, then is what? Next wealth according to his teachings.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:35.000
 Bodhic Dara, compared to all, compared to all other sentient beings.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 That is wealth. Bodhic Dara is wealth of the practicing, practicality.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:49.190
 And of course, our own goal, too many things about Bodhic Dara, we all know, we all receive these

00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:50.000
 teachings,

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:57.350
 we've all been discussing this now, many times, because it's so important, so special, and

00:26:57.350 --> 00:27:01.000
 necessary is the condition of these entire practices.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:08.110
 And this is, again, that means, here, compassion, Bodhic Dara is not just a way to do these

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:14.000
 practices, where we know the sadness, or join three times those prayers.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:21.130
 It means, he's the human saint, always, because this is the wealth of all the time, everlasting

00:27:21.130 --> 00:27:22.000
 wealth.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:30.190
 Therefore, we keep this wealth all the time, whether we are in a meditation status, or practicing

00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:31.000
 status,

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:40.000
 or whether we are in also a meditation status, we should keep this Bodhic Dara.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:45.000
 Bodhic Dara has two, we discuss any, and you know all that.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.000
 Relate true Bodhic Dara, and absolute true Bodhic Dara.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:58.000
 And coordinate your practices, apply that as much as you can, particularly Bodhic Dara of Relatru,

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000
 with four boneless toads.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.000
 Really, we keep that to all the sentient beings, as much as you can.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:15.190
 Okay, to all the beings, and we have that, then this is, will become the 75% of the wealth, wealth

00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:20.000
 of, very much, so that is Bodhic Dara.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000
 Keep all the time that Bodhic Dara.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:31.000
 And the next one is, next wealth is, then, the impermanent.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:39.540
 He said that, and the reduction of the grasping due to knowledge, that all component things are

00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:41.000
 impermanent.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:47.000
 And everything is impermanent. There is nothing is really not impermanent.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:54.000
 That means, all the relative truth is impermanent status.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.000
 There is a coordinate teaching, there is true economy impermanence.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:04.000
 Impermanent, something that's suddenly impermanent, then we won't detect ourselves.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:12.000
 Because, and there is gross impermanent, that which we detect, we know, may that happen.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:17.000
 Suddenly, impermanent is just constantly happening.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.000
 There is no stopping point.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000
 Everything is moving and changing.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000
 Changing to the different stages.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.000
 Even our eye and knowledge didn't detect according to the teaching.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:38.970
 Everything, both external, universal, world, and our self, our physical condition, and all is

00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:40.000
 changed.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:45.000
 And our self, as well as our mind is changed.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.000
 There is nothing really lasting forever.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000
 For those reasons, in the teaching, there is many of them.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000
 The end of the birth is to death.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.000
 End of the birth is death.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:05.000
 End of the building up, erecting, is going to fall apart.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:10.000
 Or demolish, fall apart, or go into crumbs.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:15.000
 End of gathering is going to parting.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000
 Parting.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:23.000
 End of the...

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:29.000
 Accumulating the wealth is going to consume.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:34.000
 End of the high stages is going to fall down.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000
 This is where the nature is.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000
 Nothing is going to last forever.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:45.000
 For them should not grasp and cling.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000
 Always they have that thought.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:52.000
 Thought, as much as with that thought, is all is like magical.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:57.000
 Magic is like a mirage, like a reflection moon in the waters.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:03.000
 With those understanding, increasing more love and complete wisdom to all the beings

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.000
 in the joint, appreciating ourselves of this situation.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:11.000
 Even though those are all like impermanence, but yet we are really functioning.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000
 Perfectly beautiful.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000
 How wonderful, how beautiful.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:24.000
 You, this time, for the beautiful fulfillment, that is known as practitioner's.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000
 And we have kicked this up for, then here, his own junior,

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.000
 everlasting wealth of practitioner's.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000
 And we add one more, as I said yesterday,

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000
 the cause and the effect as I in L double.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000
 We put up that.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.000
 That is just perfect.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:50.000
 And also this encompasses, they call in the teaching one called,

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000
 Paul in our session talks.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:58.000
 This is, it's also encompassed Paul in our session talks.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000
 True.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000
 Therefore, it's just have those thought and attitude.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000
 It's really the foundation of the practice.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.000
 And that makes practice so beautiful, so strong.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.000
 And we will become very wealthy practitioners.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000
 Really spiritual, very wealthy.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:22.000
 And we will lead that this wealth, wealth with us at all in the teaching.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:27.000
 When we lead this world, this wealth, whatever you develop,

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:33.000
 unearn the richness of the spiritual, it well came with us.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.000
 It's never going to leave behind as samsara material wealth.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000
 This wealth comes.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.000
 This is therefore his own junior, everlasting wealth.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:50.000
 This is not going to something leave behind and then empty head, leave the wall.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:55.000
 We go with full of air, full with heart, filled with reach,

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000
 courage and commitment.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 Confidence.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000
 Really we lead this, according to the teaching.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000
 So this is the, this poor wealth.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.000
 And that is my brief talk for today.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.000
 And thank very much everyone again for participate.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.000
 And then I like to do this, even though maybe I'll give you the box of hope,

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.000
 quite while, but I like to complete this, this one,

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.000
 this teaching of his own junior, slowly by slowly.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000
 So that's my kind of thinking.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:28.000
 And as well as his son, my brother and my son.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.000
 And I also, I kind of encourage him to do that.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000
 And I like to do that.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.000
 And thank you very much for participating again.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000
 Thank you every, thank you.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.000
 And today is a very special day, as I say, that you know how to do it.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000
 So now we do the how to do it.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.000
 Praise.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.000
 But at the same time, for practice.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:52.000
 I remember that you do the practice, the idea of time, please join with us.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000
 We will do the same.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.000
 Thank you.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.000
 And then we are the Buddha of the buddha sadhana.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000
 We follow with that.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:08.000
 This is the buddha sadhana.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000
 Please, please.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:23.000
 And now we add this buddha sadhana to the new version.
