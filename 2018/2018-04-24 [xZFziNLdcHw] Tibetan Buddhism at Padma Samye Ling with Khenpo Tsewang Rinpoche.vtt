 "In the Buddha teaching, every living being has the beautiful potential known as the Buddha

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:32.500
 teaching. Everyone's inherent nature is this inconceivable state of wisdom, loving-kindness,

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:44.220
 compassion. Only we have to let it wake up." "My own experience has proven to me time

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:54.280
 and time again that Christian science heals. Mary Baker Ready saw that there were laws behind

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.940
 the healings of Jesus, that she could heal other people and then she could teach other

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.840
 people to heal others." "It's getting the human mind out of the way and allowing the

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:17.360
 divine mind and divine consciousness to be present." "The heart and soul of Jainism

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:27.520
 lies in a hensa, not to cause injury to others, all forms of life." "If you believe in non-violence

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:36.880
 and not hurting people, vegetarians, you are Jain." CBS presents World Religions Tibetan

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:48.560
 Buddhism, Christian Science and Jainism. The narrator is Ted Holmes.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.380
 Buddhism was founded in the sixth century in northern India. The religion's founder

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:02.040
 is known as Gotama Buddha. "The essence of the Buddha teaching is to be kind and to be

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:10.160
 nice and to feel happy." The venerable Kenpo Sei-Wang Rinpoche is the founder of Padmasamye

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:18.180
 Ling, a Tibetan Buddhist monastery in upstate New York. "Wherever you go, always be calm

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:27.880
 and peaceful, watch your mind, those are what Buddha teaches." Siddhartha Gotama was born

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.760
 the son of a king and lived a privileged and sheltered life. "In his early 20s, he was

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:41.240
 venturing outside of the usual area of where he was kept and he started to see people sick

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:47.480
 and people getting old and people dying. And that immediately caused the question in his

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.840
 mind, will this happen to me? That led him to look inwardly, what is the cause of this

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:03.400
 trouble, all this suffering?" "The fundamental cause of suffering is one's own deed and one's

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:12.040
 own action and negative emotions such as ignorance and attachment, anger." Gotama left the palace

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.880
 and went to live the life of a monk. While meditating under a Bodhi tree, he attained

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:27.280
 enlightenment. "The principle cause of suffering that he found was that core feeling, that

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:35.000
 I have this fixed, permanent, singular, independent, unchanging self in here which I so strongly

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:46.240
 feel is there, that me actually isn't there, it's not findable. That was his enlightenment.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:51.080
 Without filtering everything through this narrow sense of grasping, ego clinging, it's

00:03:51.080 --> 00:04:03.960
 peace, it's loving, it's calm, it's infinitely available." The way out of suffering is through

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:11.480
 ethical conduct, thought and meditation. "Just be in the moment in the present state and then

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:19.160
 bring more love and joy and kindness to all beings in your self and that is not meditation

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:26.840
 and a perfect concentration." Meditation is a technique that will quiet the mind and actually

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.880
 help the mind look into itself. It doesn't matter if we're in a corporate world or raising

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.600
 kids, if we can connect to that nature and have that motivation of love and compassion

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:43.520
 and kindness, then everything is practice. "Maybe it's good to have some challenging

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:49.640
 difficulties that will make our self strong, strong, we'll not just become marshmallows,

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:58.400
 bunch of marshmallows. We learn and grow deepening ourselves." By the eighth century Buddhism

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:04.480
 had flourished throughout Asia before becoming established in Tibet, a rural mountainous

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:18.320
 country north of India. "Within Tibetan Buddhism there is a lot of outer ceremony. There's

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:24.520
 wearing the clothes one wears, there's during the practices, there's recitation of different

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:36.960
 prayers and instruments played and offerings made, murals reminding us of the Buddha nature's

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:50.960
 wisdom and compassion. This is all there as a support for our inner meditation." Tibetan

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:56.800
 Buddhists looked to his holiness the Dalai Lama as their leader. Until recently he was

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:03.600
 also the leader of the Tibetan government in exile. "India is my home now. It is a great

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:10.160
 emanation of the Buddha of compassion. His activity, his love, his kindness, his courage,

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:24.480
 his openness, both so much calm and peace, harmonious to the Tibetan public." In 1950

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:31.280
 Tibet was invaded by China, the sound of red Chinese guns. Since the invasion it's estimated

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:37.680
 that nearly one million Tibetans have lost their lives and 6,000 monasteries were destroyed.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:45.040
 "In the consequential struggle, the Chinese armed forces destroyed a large number of monasteries.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:52.640
 Many lamas were killed." 150,000 refugees fled across the border to India, Nepal and

00:06:52.640 --> 00:07:01.000
 beyond. Among those refugees was the venerable Kenpo Sewang Rinpoche. When he was 9 he and

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.240
 his family were forced to leave eastern Tibet in the dead of winter. "They traveled at night

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:11.160
 and then they would stop in camp and they would have to assess what news there was, which

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:18.800
 ways was safer, which ways was not. Many had become ill. They actually had no food many,

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:26.200
 many days." His mother and two sisters did not survive the 18 month journey. But Kenpo

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:32.360
 and his older brother, the venerable Kenshin Palden Sharab Rinpoche, eventually made it

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:37.320
 all the way to America where they played a pivotal role in bringing Tibetan Buddhists

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:42.840
 into this country. "And even their father came here and lived here for 10 years. These

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:48.480
 wonderful Kenpos have encountered such a difficult life and yet been able to express it and turn

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:56.000
 it into this incredible message." In 1993 they established Padma Samye Ling, just off

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:02.200
 Buddha Highway in the western Catskills of upstate New York. "I remember the first days

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:05.440
 they were walking on the land and there was really nothing here, it was completely bare.

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:09.440
 They had their Tibetan hats on and then I really thought they brought part of Tibet

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:16.280
 here and they have their land now." The temple is a replica of Samye Monastery, one of the

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:22.040
 first in Tibet. "And it has like all the traditional aspects the Tibetan Buddhist Monastery Retreat

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:27.600
 Center would have in Tibet, has an extensive library, year-round instructions from total

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:33.720
 beginner level to like more advanced practices and it goes all the way back in the lineage

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:40.920
 to Buddhist Shakyamuni." "So this is the one way in assembly of all of the enlightened

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:47.120
 beings of the different universe here and as well as many enlightened beings in Buddhas

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:56.080
 from India to Tibet. May is really the energy brings us like satellite disk that us meeting

00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:02.760
 the great energies of love and compassion kindness and truth to all everywhere and therefore

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:12.800
 the universe of the world become peace and harmony and calm." We will return after these

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:40.000
 messages. To view this program and others like it go to
