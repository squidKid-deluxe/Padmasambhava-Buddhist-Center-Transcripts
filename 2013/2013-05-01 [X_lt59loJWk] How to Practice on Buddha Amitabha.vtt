00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.760
 Amitabha practice is a very special practice that Buddha Shakyamuni taught in the suttara, very

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.000
 much, Buddha said, it's so important, so special.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.290
 Why it's so important for the duality beings? Because to connect to Amitabha is so easy, that's

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:23.000
 what Buddha said.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:31.330
 Buddha Shakyamuni, his own world, his own voice, from his love and kind, compassion and wisdom, he

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.000
 said, Buddha, connect to the Buddha Amitabha is so easy, so simple.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:45.780
 And also, to be born in that pure land is so easy, so simple, because that is the promise and

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.000
 commitment of the Buddha Amitabha Himself.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.900
 Other pure lands, such as the five dialects of Buddha's pure land, for example, pure land of the

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:02.740
 Vedic Sato, pure land of the Akkubiya, all the Ranasambha, and the Amogha Siddha, and the Veda Jan

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:07.000
as are very difficult to connect rebirth in those pure lands,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.310
 because you have to have, or those individuals like to rebirth there, have to have realizations,

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.000
 high realizations, quite good high realizations.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 That's what we take, rebirth in this pure land.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 But Amitabha pure land is because of the promise and commitment of the Buddha Amitabha.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.720
 Tabha is easy to get. Buddha Amitabha had the special commitment when he was born in Sato, and the

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:43.000
 teaching said, or Buddha Shakyamuni said, told that he made the commitment,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:53.250
 when I get enlightenment, in my pure land will be the pure land of everyone who are deluded, who

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.000
 are heavily obscured.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.740
 But as long as they have the intention, joy and the thought to take rebirth or born in my pure land

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.000
, may they all be born in that pure land.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:16.080
 If such things have not happened, may I not become Buddha. That's what the Buddha Amitabha made,

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.000
 the commitment.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:28.080
 As he made the commitment and he created enlightenment, therefore his pure land is very open, very

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.000
 free.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:37.070
 If you are the beings, can take rebirth in pure land. And then all the high realization beings also

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:42.000
 try to rebirth in pure lands, in the pure land of the Buddha Amitabha.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 Therefore, pure land of the Buddha Amitabha is so simple, easy, and very direct.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.480
 And then the teaching said, when you reach the rebirth in pure land of Amitabha, there is no names

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:06.000
 of sufferings, difficulties, troubles, challenges that we go through in these lives.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 For that reason, great Master Karma Chambi said one of his teachings,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 "In this world, there is a life applied to go through, death, getting old, sickness, and birth."

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 He used the example as Rosary, when we read the Malabhi, it just goes on and on and on.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 And for that reason, he said, better to take the rebirth in the pure land of the Buddha Amitabha,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.230
 where there is, if we don't have to go that transition again and again, we can stay a long time,

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.000
 that's known as pure land of the Buddha Amitabha,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 is pure land of the longevity, longevity pure land. Stay a long time in that pure land.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:58.310
 And during that long time, we are staying in the youth force, not getting old, not sicknesses, and

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:04.000
 then even we don't feel the death of that change for long times.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:13.340
 No sicknesses, no getting orders, no sufferings, no difficulties, no troubles, no chaestics.

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:24.520
 Therefore, this pure land is even named as land of blissfulness, land of great comfort, great happy

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.000
.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.500
 With that pure land, we take birth, it's not that we are spending time wasting time. In the

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:40.790
 teachings said, in that pure land, everyone is so alert, so mindfulness, so concentrated, so

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.000
 thoughtful,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:50.050
 never going to waste it. Careful, like disgustingly or with carefully, always cultivating the bodh

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.000
icata, love, kindness, compassion.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:01.030
 As much as you could develop the compassion of love and kindness, bodhicata, that much immense of

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:09.000
 the joy, happy in peace and comfort is bursting, is glowing, is shining in the teachings said.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.100
 That is what the pure land of the Buddha Amitabha is. It's so easy, so simple, and there we can

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:24.000
 advance all the bhumis, all the five parts, we can advance one after another, one after another,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 one after another.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 Supports there, meditation there, inspiration there, joy and devotion there, everything is there.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 That's what we need to develop bodhicata.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:42.510
 And not just only that, because of your development, achievement, then you are not also restricted

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.000
 in that pure land all the time.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:53.750
 As you developed in the teachings said, again, Gary, the master, Garamacham, he said, you can

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:58.000
 travel, you are free traveling, every pure land, every world, even can come back to this world.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:06.570
 He said, in the time of the old Buddha's 1000 Buddha to come, or like 996 Buddha to come, you will

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:12.800
 come in and receive the teachings, inspire all those devotees in that time and go back to the pure

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.000
 land of the Buddha Amitabha.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.980
 It's so easy, so beautiful, and traveling, and pure land of the Buddha, among us, pure land of the

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:31.090
 Rana sambhava, pure land of the Aktobhi, Vyasatva, all other pure lands that you can travel, go and

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:32.000
 come back.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:39.970
 That's what the pure land of the Buddha Amitabha is. So therefore, every teaching of the practice

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:48.870
 lineage contains this teaching of the part known as pure practices or Amitabha practices. Easy and

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:50.000
 simple.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.240
 And therefore, this practice can't be like, well, we made it at the practice, and we can remember

00:06:51.240 --> 00:07:05.000
 the Buddha Amitabha, and we think that, and pray for that. It's good, it's part of our practices.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:12.980
 And to tell you the birth of the pure land of the Buddha Amitabha, in the teachings said, there is

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:15.000
 only four things we need.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 One, this is the principle, cause and conditions to be built in the pure land.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.230
 And first is, thinking of the Buddha Amitabha in the pure land, again in the pure land of the

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:33.000
 devotee, in the pure land of the Buddha Amitabha, again and again, again and again, every contain,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:40.570
 even during the day times, once in a while, or two times, three times, or once in a while, that is

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:42.000
 post.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:48.830
 First, the second is, then two good deeds, that is part of our practice, it's not any extra

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:56.470
 practices, two good deeds, good meritorly practices, accumulation meritorly practices, versatile

00:07:56.470 --> 00:08:00.970
 meritorly practices, then our practice, key practices, it's not something that I'm going to go

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:08.140
 there again, I'm not going to practice, I'm waiting for my retirement, this is not like that, I'm

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:09.000
 not going to wait.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:17.730
 Key practice, this is what we started already, so we're not going to start devotee when, in the, in

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:25.130
 the, after a hundred years or fifty years, we started devotee right here, right now, key practice,

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:33.770
 key practice, do accumulate the merits, merits, that is second cause, principle cause of taking

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:35.000
 devotees.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:42.660
 Third cause is again the same thing, nothing different, both each other, increasing both each other

00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:49.460
, kinds of comparing thought, you know, we talk about that, all the time, it is not just we talk

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:52.000
 that, that is essential teaching of the Buddha Shaktamuni.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.900
 From the Hinayana teaching, all the way to the Dokki teaching, both each other, kindness,

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:05.260
 compassion, love, complete and poor bones thought, and both each other means not just self-centered

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:11.000
 attitude, opening our heart and mind to all the beings, beings.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:20.320
 We can, everyone be born to the purely other, amita, amita, we can, no one has suffered anything,

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:29.510
 no one unwanted things happen to anyone, everything comes with so joy, peaceful, happy, really the

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:36.770
 poor boneless attitude, bring up that attitude, that is known as both each other, that is third

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:40.000
 cause, cause.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:47.310
 Third cause is to take rebirth in the devotees, so that is our practice, nothing, any unusual, and

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:55.980
 the fourth one is dedicate the merits, that is also same thing, nothing, but if you can dedicate,

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:58.000
 that is slowly change.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:06.350
 I dedicated this merit to take my rebirth in the pure and the devotee and as well as rebirth of

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:12.950
 every living beings to take birth in the devotee, that they are redirected, that dedication is

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:14.000
 slightly different.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:21.210
 Otherwise, dedicate in the merit, same way, for the enlightenment, for the removal, suffering,

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:24.000
 sadness, all the sentient beings.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:33.400
 With that, those are known as false principles, cause, all the conditions that will take rebirth in

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.000
 the devotees.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:42.900
 The fourth one is thinking of the Buddha Amitabha, amitabhas, again and again, every you can say,

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:48.000
 every day, all once in the daytime, all once in the evening time.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:54.420
 The Buddha Shakyamuni says, also teaching, Amitabha Suttar said, Ananda, Ananda was one of the

00:10:54.420 --> 00:11:00.000
 principle audience when Buddha Shakyamuni gave the Amitabha Suttar teachings.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:08.440
 Ananda, look to the western direction and hold the flowers and throw that, throw to the Buddha Amit

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:15.000
abha, Ananda, that will be caused to take the rebirth in the pure land of the Buddha Amitabha.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:23.410
 That's what the Ah, Buddha Shakyamuni said, said to Ananda, look to the facing to the direction,

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:30.000
 western directions, directions, and throw the flowers, thinking of the Buddha Amitabha Suttar.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:36.070
 That is what take the Buddha, that's it. So, simple things, I mean, I think that, but these simple

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:41.000
 things, it looks so simple, but this is the body of action, intention.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:51.800
 Intention, motivation, time, right moment, right way, the impact is so strong, so deep, so

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:53.000
 beautiful.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:12:01.000
 And that we can do for all the beings, those who pass away, pass away, we can do these practices.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 Those who are going to come future, and those who are here, we do these practices.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:12.270
 We act as a representative of everyone to the goodness things, and we heal good things for all

00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:13.000
 needs.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:20.430
 That is our practice, not just the practice of the during, or practice of the Buddha Amitabha, that

00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:23.000
 is our practice, that is meditate.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:30.560
 That is also not just practice because something, but this is our heart. That is genuinely,

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:33.000
 genuinely it is.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:41.360
 You see, the Buddha nature, that spark, that shining, each time when we do that, we are glorifying

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:46.000
 our, you see, we are making that appearance perfect, everything beautiful.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.530
 We are polishing, we are glorifying that. We are touching to our core of the inner heart, the

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:52.000
 nature, our own beings.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 It is not just an extra we are doing, we are glorifying that nature, and that means when we glorify

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
 that nature, what is going out?

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:07.610
 Immediately we are cleansing, removing, transforming the unwanted, the happy dependence, negat

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:10.000
ivities, grasping, dualities.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 That makes it difficult to me, that makes it difficult to everyone, that is removing.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:23.000
 An increase that makes happy me, that makes happy everyone, that is increasing, that is developing.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:29.000
 So therefore, it is wonderful, it is so beautiful, that is what we do.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 And the Buddha Amitabha is so simple. Again, there is nothing public city thinks.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:40.390
 The same as the Buddha Amitabha is that, actually, except the color is different, that color is

00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:41.000
 what you can say.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 And then feel the whole presence of the enlightenment.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:53.200
 The Buddha Amitabha is sovereign with all the Buddhas, and Bodhisattvas, and Bodhisattvas, and Ar

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:56.000
amas, everyone is there, everyone.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 And then for example, you know, great masters, Bhutal, Vritti, Puyalland, Rinaland, Nagarjuna.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:12.270
 Nagarjuna last his statement, what he said, "I will go to the Puyalland and Devaji, but afterward I

00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:14.000
 will come back here."

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.000
 He said, "I will go now in Devaji, I will come back."

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 Nagarjuna also is there, and then many great thetans, many great masters, and one after another,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:33.000
 and then the other one again, great master, Karma Changi, also said, "I will go to Puyalland."

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:40.620
 And many of those great masters also in there, and many of our practitioners are so devoted to that

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:41.000
.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:50.340
 And then also I saw that, I read, long time ago, I read that short life story of the famous Chinese

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:53.000
 master, Hunsang.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 Hunsang is so famous, and he wrote such a so beautiful guide books that nobody really did like him.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:10.110
 He wrote so thoroughly, so mega, so mathematical, and he wrote every time he was travelling from

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:11.000
 that, I think, seventh century.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 He was travelling from China, and all the way from the Silk Road, and all the way from India,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000
 and he stayed, I think, twelve years or ten years or something.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:31.000
 Then he took the same route, he went back to China, and he wrote such a big lot of books of the

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:31.000
 Buddha teaching.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 He brought back, and then he translated.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 I heard he was one of the great masters, the translators in the Chinese Buddhism.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
 There are so many books and film books.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:51.000
 I read his life story, last time he was nearly, he's leaving his body, he began to tell,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 that he's smiling, smiling fast, how many lotals are falling in his pattern,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.000
 how Amitabha is appearing to his one. That's what he said.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
 He's laughing, smiling, and the Lord was welcome.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:10.000
 That in the teaching, he said to the Buddha, "Buddha Shaktamun is teaching on Amitabha Sutras."

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 We're devoted to those things, and the Buddha will come as support and usher us to the prior land.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:26.000
 Well, we are not going to see all the part of the experience have to go through all that.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:32.000
 There will be Buddha, "Buddha Shaktamun will usher", sorry, Amitabha, Amitabha, too.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:39.190
 "Buddha Amitabha will usher those individuals joyfully living in the prior land of the Buddha Amit

00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:40.000
abha."

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.000
 That's what he said. So that is what is about "Buddha Amitabha."

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
 And then we have very beautiful prayers of the Buddha Amitabha.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:54.000
 There's a long one, a long one which is composed by the Great Master Karma Chami.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:03.000
 Karma Chami's words are not just a word of duality, a word of the ego-clean and grasping.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:11.000
 His words are the vegetable. It's so powerful, so simple, so powerful in effort.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 That practice, long prayer of the Buddha Amitabha of the Karma Chami is so popular.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 Both new mind and Akkadu schools, everyone practice, whether you lay a person,

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:32.000
 whether you are fully old-end one, or the novice man, or great master, great scholar,

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:41.000
 no matter who you are, so many of those pastors practice, so many practices become so popular.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 For example also, Padra Ramadhi also practices that Amitabha prayers.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 And he went village to village in the teaching, all the life stories.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.000
 Padra Ramadhi went village to village and gathering all the villagers

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000
 and having the practice of the Amitabha for seven days on one wing,

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 and stopping the chopping, hunting, butchering, and everything.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 And then how everybody should stay. Nonviolence, peaceful, and practice of the Amitabha.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000
 He really did, he's so famous then. And then as well as all those great masters.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.000
 Even now, for example, in India to be, I hear so popular practicing,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 by his son Kimbun, Yungun Punso, his foremost, and one of the disciples,

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000
 known as Kimbun, Tsutang Lodu. And their students, it's become so popular.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.000
 Everywhere they practice, the long practice of the Karma Chamas once that.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000
 So it's very famous. But also short ones.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 For example, for those who would like to practice, it's here that we join.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 In the Bhaiji 7-2, Bhaiji 7-2, this is very famous.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
 This is Namchim Madhya Dhulji, this is Therma.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 But also, Raga Aksi, bless it. Raga Aksi is teaching.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:01.000
 So therefore it is like teaching of the both Namchim Madhya Dhulji and Raga Aksi.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.000
 And Namchim Madhya Dhulji said, Amitabha taught him this.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 Amitabha spoke that to him in the teaching.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000
 He said, "This Yung, great dead man."

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000
 Amitabha spoke in a person that is hidden in his vision.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:25.000
 Amitabha, Kelezi and Vaidya Pani and all, they became and said this, said this.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000
 So as he talked about it, as he said that to Raga Aksi,

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:35.000
 Raga Aksi starts to graduate. Raga Aksi or Karma Chami, which is the name of also Karma Chami.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 Karma Chami always he mention, said that he is the minister of the great dead.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000
 Raga Aksi said to him. So you see, he is both his teachings.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000
 This is very famous. And the long one, if you like to have practices there,

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 and also I can offer that too. I have quite a few copies.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:59.000
 If you like to practice, it is a little long, but I offer that too.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 If you like to practice, I have very good copies of that.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.000
 And that I will say, if you practice once in a while, if you can.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 If you can practice every day, of course, great.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 But once in a while, once in a week, or once in a month, or once in a year,

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000
 and if you can practice, I will keep that.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 I will offer you. See, I have copies, quite a few copies of that.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.000
 But anyway, practice of the Buddha Amitabha, that's what it is important.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000
 And now, when you practice of the Buddha Amitabha, particularly here,

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000
 in the short window practice, know what we have, what we have.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.000
 I pray to the Buddha Amitabha in Salafon.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.000
 May I actualize the transferring techniques.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:51.000
 That's what the teaching says. So it is practicing on the Buddha Amitabha.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000
 To do the transferring technique, his only journey himself said,

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000
 it is not that we have to put exactly the poor practices,

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000
 but you make that connection.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:07.000
 You make that passage to take the rebirth and build and build.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:13.000
 With this almost similar style, similar techniques of the poor practices.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000
 The poor practices, as you all know, I think many of you, most everyone knows,

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000
 the poor means transferring, transferring.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000
 What we are transferring? We are transferring the consciousness.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.000
 What that consciousness is, same consciousness is

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.000
 concepted in a mother's womb of between two elements.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 That consciousness, that consciousness, we are transferring.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000
 That consciousness, that consciousness is a mother's time,

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000
 is concepted with, when we are concepted, time is

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000
 concepted with two elements of the parentess,

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000
 but where that principally resides in that.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000
 That principally resides in the heart center.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000
 Heart center, that consumption is what is.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000
 That consumption is absolute level.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 That is nuxi, this nuxi what we are talking.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000
 That is what we are really transferring.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000
 And why don't we call nuxi?

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000
 Because even though it has nuxi,

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000
 but it is called with duality mind.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:31.000
 So, we are transferring the duality mind of nuxi with duality mind.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 Duality mind, that, to the devotee, the pure devotees.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:44.000
 When you visualize, do the transferring techniques,

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000
 of course many of you know already this,

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000
 and there is beautiful teaching practice,

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000
 the Kintiramudu Veda, and I had the great opportunity

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000
 to join with him, and that also, recently,

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000
 Tapu and Amandade added in that beautiful dance.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.000
 So, there is already that.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:04.000
 But however, again, this is how we go.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.000
 We should train by three intentions.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.000
 Three intentions.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000
 That is simple.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:15.000
 And therefore, the first intention is the destinations.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000
 Where are we going?

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.000
 Destination is building of the Buddha Amitabha

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000
 and heart of the Buddha Amitabha.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.000
 That is our destination, that we are going there.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:32.000
 That means, I'm going to ask, are my consciousness going there?

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000
 And how are we going?

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:42.000
 That is, then, the central channel as passage.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:48.000
 Central channel is like, as, what's called, like rocket.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000
 Rocket passage, that's what it's called.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:56.000
 When the special channel just goes up,

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000
 something drops.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000
 What's that?

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000
 What?

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000
 Peaceful light.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000
 Peaceful light.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.000
 The first light is central channel.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.000
 Central channel is first light, or passage.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 That is passage.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000
 And what is the trouble?

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000
 Is the consciousness already set?

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000
 Trouble is consciousness.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000
 Who is going to space?

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000
 Space shuttle challenge.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:35.000
 Space shuttle challenge is our consciousness of with the nuxi,

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000
 of nuxi with the conception.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000
 Because there's no other choice.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.000
 We have to have nuxi.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000
 That's grasping.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:50.000
 If we have fully revered nuxi, even we don't need to do this.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.000
 But since we have this, we are covered with it, with duality.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.000
 But nuxi is heading with duality.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.000
 That space shuttle challenge of the nuxi with duality

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:08.000
 is heading to the space of the Buddha Amitabha

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000
 and the field land of Buddha Amitabha.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.000
 Once you go there, what are you going to do?

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.000
 You're going to orbit in the field land.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000
 That is now.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.000
 And see all the beautiful galaxies.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:28.000
 Sun, and the moon, stars, stars, and also Earth.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000
 It's not something that you're going.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000
 You are.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000
 Change the position.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.000
 Change you.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000
 And we will do continually the same thing

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 as we've been doing this time.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000
 We're already in duality among the four.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.000
 Four that cause of duality, rebirth and duality.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000
 Among the four, we don't have a thing now to take birth

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.000
 in the field land.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000
 They were thinking that again.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.000
 You already did.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000
 But what we will take to other base to make.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000
 And then you do the meditually activity,

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000
 both the other activity, then again in practice.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000
 All we need.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000
 That we keep.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000
 Continue the same thing.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000
 Same way we keep that.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 That, with that attitude.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000
 We need to come to this.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000
 This in the teaching said, I mean, you read that.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000
 But that's what you said.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.000
 And we're realizing,

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.000
 Buddha Amitabha right above our head.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000
 Head right in the sky.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000
 Sky and with the stone.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000
 Devote in stone and tension.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000
 You know Amitabha is in volume the all.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000
 The Buddha is every in like beings.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000
 Come in one single status

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.000
 and pray to him strongly.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000
 And then when time comes,

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000
 when time comes,

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:46.000
 I'm going to, going to Buddha Amitabha.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.000
 That you think, you pray that.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.000
 You pray that.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000
 And visualize Buddha Amitabha right above our head.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.000
 And occasionally you can also think

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000
 that satrajana and the consciousness,

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.000
 that is how I'm going to do.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000
 Kind of rehearsing.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000
 Rehearsing, reactivating them.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000
 That is what we do.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000
 That is known as the practicing,

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000
 really practicing of the poor.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000
 Poor or practicing particularly,

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000
 making the connection to the people Buddha Amitabha.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000
 And preparing,

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000
 task-faring the consciousness of that.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000
 And generally in the teaching said,

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000
 that you read the books,

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000
 there's many different types of the pause.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000
 Dharmakaya on pause.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000
 Dharmakaya task-faring the consciousness is,

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.000
 what we're doing.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000
 Meditating on the zuk instead.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000
 Meditating on the absolute state of nature.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000
 That is Dharmakaya task.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000
 In that level, there's nothing to task well,

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.000
 nothing to notice,

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000
 but it's beyond all activities.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.000
 Relax.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000
 Relax in that nature state.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.000
 It is the most powerful

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000
 poor practices.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.000
 And you can't,

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000
 not just that notion,

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.000
 that traveling effort,

00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.000
 but you capture it.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000
 Entire the universe.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000
 Entire the samsara and the rata,

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000
 as building of the Buddha Amitabha.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000
 There's no notion to need,

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.000
 traveling this and that.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000
 You are in that state.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.000
 Right there.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000
 From there, you're going to behold every person.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000
 And the second is sampukaya,

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.000
 task-faring.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.000
 That is practicing of the visualization,

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.000
 meditation.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000
 Practical has followed the teaching,

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000
 and we can write that.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.000
 That is again, right?

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:34.000
 Those great beings can do this right before,

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000
 the moment of death or after the death.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000
 When they experience all those coming,

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000
 padau vivin, they come.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.000
 And then, the namaka is redirected and re-burnt.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.000
 Re-burnt.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.000
 And then after that, after we pass through,

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.000
 after the padau, again redirect with your mindfulness.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000
 Then redirect the birds,

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000
 attract the higher rank, higher status.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.000
 Those are there.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 But these poor practices or this one,

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000
 immediately connected to your land,

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.000
 immediately visualize the Buddha Amitabha,

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000
 and it is so powerful,

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000
 so speakerly teaching said.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000
 It's so speakerly, so powerful,

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000
 because we are still higher.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000
 Still, our mind is active.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000
 And when we go to the transition

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000
 of the dissolution experience at the last moment,

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000
 sometimes our mind is not so clear,

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000
 not so strong.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.000
 Even you reverse,

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000
 even you have all the poor practices,

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.000
 all that.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000
 But due to the convergent circumstances,

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000
 sometimes there is difficulties.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000
 But if we do always like this,

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.000
 with strong devotion,

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000
 one from the point of thought,

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000
 and thinking of the Amitabha,

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000
 and thinking of all beings with that,

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000
 that will bring,

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000
 no matter whatever the situation happens,

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.000
 it will take off.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 It will take out.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000
 That attitude, that energy,

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.000
 so that really we can have rebirth,

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000
 or the transition is very beautiful,

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.000
 and spacious.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000
 And then all the signs,

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000
 different those in the part of those,

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000
 there are so many beautiful part of teachings,

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.000
 all those things.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000
 Poor teachings I won't go through,

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.000
 but that is what practice is.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.000
 Once those are finished,

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.000
 as in the teaching,

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000
 I may ask our Hindu practices,

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 I pray to the Buddha Amitabha,

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000
 may I actualize the practice of the poor,

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000
 or ask for the functions.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000
 After you practice that with that connection,

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.000
 and after that,

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000
 then you Amitabha again,

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.000
 with that blessing,

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000
 lights came from Amitabha,

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000
 and to all the beings,

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.000
 and to you,

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000
 and finally Amitabha dissolves.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.000
 Dissolve,

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000
 and that comes down to your kurong chakra,

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000
 the center channels,

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000
 and to the heart center,

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:56.000
 and merge it with your muxing,

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.000
 and then meditate,

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000
 and it's up to status.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.000
 Status.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:09.000
 So that is really how we do the practice of this,

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.000
 this poor practices.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000
 Now, with these practices,

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.000
 again,

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 now once we do these practices,

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.000
 then we meditate.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000
 When meditating comes,

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.000
 as the great Mahatma Mahatma body mentioned,

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.000
 so many times,

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.000
 then we relax,

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000
 the all inner state of the nature of the mind,

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000
 which is in the Tibetan teaching,

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000
 or the Doki terminology, nuxi.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.000
 The all inner nature of the mind,

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000
 we are going to relax.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000
 The all inner nature of the mind is,

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.000
 is free from compounding,

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.000
 free from that existing,

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.000
 free from the non-existing,

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:56.000
 free from every aspect of the grasping and hope.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.000
 It's totally free.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000
 Simple thing to tell,

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.000
 this muxing is free from the grasping,

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000
 free from any reference point,

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.000
 free from any focal point.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000
 Relax on that nature.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000
 That, that natural is open,

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000
 that natural is freedom,

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.000
 that nature is infinite,

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.000
 that nature is performed.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.000
 Those all the terminology we use

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:29.000
 can explore the college of death.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.000
 But the deep, really college of this nature,

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.000
 how we explore our own meditator.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:40.000
 Sattva, Sattva, even pristine cognition,

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000
 will only experience.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 That's what it is such, the great master,

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000
 Rahul Bhaddara, said,

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.000
 O, Buddha's son, Rahul Bhaddara,

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.000
 praise to the mother of the old,

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000
 Buddha's, Parnya Paramata,

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000
 self as which I,

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.000
 inconceivable, inexpressible,

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000
 unborn, unceasing,

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.000
 natural like the sky,

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000
 it is not just then, what is this?

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.000
 Nothing to do, nothing to find.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.000
 It's not.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000
 It's only well experienced.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000
 The practitioners,

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000
 the individual practitioners,

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000
 will experience this pristine cognition,

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000
 the awareness,

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.000
 verbally experience that.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000
 Behold that verbally, that experience.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.000
 So it is, that is the nature.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.000
 And for that reason,

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.000
 in teaching user examples,

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.000
 Sattva used examples as molasses

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.000
 experienced by the nude persons.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.000
 Nude person cannot explain

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000
 the flavor of the molasses

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000
 or the chocolates,

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.000
 but the nude person truly experiences,

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000
 truly the flavor of that,

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000
 truly experiences in the direction

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000
 directed their status.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000
 That's how the true nature is,

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000
 not by the mundane world,

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000
 the conceptual world,

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000
 the conceptual vocabulary can put

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000
 inconceivable nature.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000
 Even Buddha didn't produce,

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000
 only what Buddha said,

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000
 inconceivable, inexpressible,

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000
 unborn, unceasing,

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000
 all those the Buddha used for.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.000
 That is the what Maha Ramadhi wanted,

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.000
 pointing out.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.000
 He said,

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000
 he should not take any misunderstanding

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000
 of any things,

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.000
 those subtle mind,

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000
 and those empty,

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.000
 and all these things.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.000
 It's beyond.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.000
 And we started thinking,

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.000
 it's subtle mind.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000
 Then I'm here,

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000
 great master pointed out,

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.000
 many times.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000
 And so that is the nature,

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 nature that we have spent.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000
 Otherwise, we should not take

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:11.000
 mistakenly all these different things

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000
 and purposely different things.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.000
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.000
 and make their own convenience,

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.000
 change the authentic teachings

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.000
 and we can go wrong directions.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.000
 That's what the predicted by--
