00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.160
 Same thing as we started this meditation of the visualization, one is called the Satchinas Samadha,

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:15.360
 or in the teaching here translate, "Dakness", "Dakness", "Dakness" is Nature.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:27.210
 This is Absolute Mother Iximshoja, or Pandya Paramata, the Dzogchen status. That is, without any

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.600
 discrimination,

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:39.520
 without any grasping, without any subtle object activity, you abiding in the Nature as it is.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:45.760
 This is not just a way of making up this again, just a little old way of not making up.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.360
 Everything is teaching of the Natures, with the Nature. For that reason, Buddha teaching is

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.040
 teaching of the Nature.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:01:02.080
 Teaching of the Way turns out, nothing went up, up, up above the Nature, nothing went below Nature.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:12.320
 Simple, very plain Nature, simple Nature. Nature is never changed. Nature is always there.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:19.680
 As you have the realization of the Satchinas Samadhi, as you understand that, we should keep up

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.040
 that realization

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:28.580
 throughout the teaching, not just at the very beginning, not at the very end, but keep all the time

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:29.680
 that we,

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:42.880
 as much as we can. That is known as we are standing up, feeling the pillar of the unshakeable will.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:49.280
 That is that. This is Dharmakaya in the Buddha's teaching, according to the realization level.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:55.360
 This is Dharmakaya in the realization level. When you achieve the realization, it is Dharmakaya.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:01.760
 When we are talking about the basic ground, this is the ground. This is the foundation.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:07.360
 And that's what in the Buddha teaching, in the teaching always, in the Tibetan terminology.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:13.200
 This is the basic foundation, where everything starts. Everything begins.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.760
 That, not just that only starting point, and then it's kind of finished.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:24.560
 That nature carries and pervades you everywhere. It's not, we are not out of that.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:32.160
 Whether we rely on that or not rely on that, nature is always here.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:40.360
 We are part of that, because that we are here. It's not something that we are looking and we are

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.760
 drools.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.760
 True, we are part of that. We have to bring that realization.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.760
 We must be big. We should not be limited in a narrow corner.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.760
 Is it vast? As a sky, sky is open, isn't it?

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:04.760
 Sky is not just only up here. Sky is everywhere. Everywhere, everywhere.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:16.760
 There is nothing one single atom, atom or the molecules that which is not pervade by the space.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.760
 That's what the Buddha teaching. There is nothing else not pervade by the great emptiness.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.760
 This is nature. Nature we are going to discuss.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.760
 And whether we recognize, whether we don't recognize, doesn't matter.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.760
 This is not recognize, recognize that you want it.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:41.760
 That is called the darkness of ignorance. It's blocking our direction and clarity, vision and goal.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.760
 And that is continually blocking that. We become narrow, narrow, narrow.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.760
 Smaller, smaller, how honestly we become so narrow, only so narrow.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.760
 Looking through the holes of the eye, the needles in a way.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.760
 Looking through the holes of the eye, through the eye of the needles.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:07.760
 That's how our views become so narrow, because duality is created by one's own self.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.760
 So the first level is this unchecked view, this foundation.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:21.760
 And from there, the second view, the nail, second tongue nail or nail or the pillar.

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:32.760
 I translated those few words, but it suits that and is then the great meditation on the deities.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:38.760
 Deities, in this case, from that great emptiness, from that great nature,

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:48.030
 magically arise it. The deity or the Buddha, this case, Buddha is Yixinzodia, total enlightened

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.760
 beings.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.760
 And what is Yixinzodia? It's love, I said so many times, you know.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:05:01.970
 It's true love and true compassion, true wisdom and true great blissfulness beyond attachment and

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:02.760
 grasping.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:09.690
 That is what Yixinzodia is. And that Yixinzodia is never separated from that nature, the first

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:10.760
 nature.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:18.760
 That is what. Therefore, her body is translucent status. Her body is rainbow bodice.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:26.760
 Her body is reflection moon in the water. Her body is reflection emit in the mirrors.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:33.760
 That is what it is. This is, this is nature, every nature is in that status.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:40.270
 But this is what we realize, what we do. Through this window, we are going to open whole these

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:41.760
 translucent status.

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:49.960
 Every form, everything what we see, ten different things is magical, is translucent, rainbow,

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.760
 reflection in the moon water and mirror images.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:06:00.240
 That's the, everything is in that status. To discover that, particularly this time we didn't

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.760
 discover because again,

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:10.060
 I'm going back, same thing as Buddha said, is duality. Our grasping made that structural, conquered

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:10.760
 soul, structures.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:17.850
 Otherwise, everything is in that status. To discover that nature, through the skill and attack in

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:18.760
 the power of the Vedayana teaching,

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:25.300
 we began to see ourselves as translucent status, as rainbow bodice, as with the blessings of Yixinz

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:25.760
odia.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:34.200
 We began to see. When we began to see truly ourselves as translucent status, then gradually that

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.760
 power was to help shine to all these objects.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:44.760
 All these things then began to see as translucent rainbow bodice status.

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:51.670
 When we see this rainbow bodice status, it's not just a rainbow, but it's absolutely the body of

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:54.760
 the loving kindness as I said.

00:06:54.760 --> 00:07:01.760
 The body of compassion, the body of verstance. Love and compassion and verstance are also known as

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:06.760
 organality, blended in the great blessings.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:13.760
 This is happy practice. This is joy practice. This is great blessings practice.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:19.970
 It's not just a practice where you bring some unnatural things, but nature is in that blessings

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:20.760
 status.

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:24.760
 Nature is in the happy, in the humble, in the peaceful status.

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:29.760
 That we are invoking. We bring up that. We highlight that.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:36.290
 It's been hiding so long by the underneath of the dualities, underneath of the ignorance, all the

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:39.760
 negative emotions, anger, jealous, hated thought,

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:48.760
 attractiveness and arrogance. It's hidden, hidden, hidden, hidden. Today we'll bring up that.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:52.760
 With the power of the teaching of the Buddha and the Guru and the Maasambhava,

00:07:52.760 --> 00:08:02.070
 skillfully, powerful, forcefully, we shine with those old things. With its own natural states,

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:09.760
 instead, bring up that true, splendid gauntlet of the beauty of the nature,

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:14.760
 the love, compassion, wisdom, great blessings.

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:22.310
 So therefore, this body of the Yishinsorya is a blissfulness force. The body of the Yishinsorya is

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:24.760
 love, compassion, wisdom.

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:33.170
 Bring that relaxation, that gauntlet, and then have all those full detailed visualizations as the

00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:34.760
 teaching explains.

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:41.010
 All those. Each of those, when we visualize and bring up that realization, what it does in the

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:41.760
 temporary level,

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:49.760
 it brings our mind more, more orderly. Our personal mind is so jumpy, so irregularities.

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:55.760
 It's devastating the one, even one moment. It's jumping everywhere. So irregularities.

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:59.760
 And for that reason, the great master Garabdharthi said, one of his teachings,

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:07.950
 certain beings, mind, or duality beings, mind is like so many pieces, so many pieces. It's just

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:11.760
 scattered so much that there is no order.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:16.760
 And then, for those reasons, all those emotions arise one after another,

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:21.760
 and then one of the most very kind of disturbances, then we forget it.

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:28.240
 Because mind is so scattered, and darkness arises, darkness comes, because there is no continuing

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:28.760
 awareness.

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:33.760
 The wisdom is shining through that, duality interrupting one after another.

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:40.340
 The scared mind, conserving thought, and then it forms as anxiety, worry, and all steps for one

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:41.760
 after another.

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:49.760
 That's because all started with the scared mind, and pieces of minds, broken minds.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:57.230
 When we visualize meditation, we are putting mind more thoroughly, more orderly, and more intellig

00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:57.760
ently,

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:04.760
 that brings the power and the strength of the wisdom, mindfulness, alertness, and consciousness.

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:09.760
 All those good things will bring up. It is sharping up, sharping up.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:15.760
 In a way, we need a kitchen, what we do? We sharpen up our shoppers.

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:20.760
 We sharpen up, sharpen up, glorify the beauties.

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:23.760
 Therefore, it is performed meditation.

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:28.760
 Even though we think that meditation is only stay in silence completely,

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:32.760
 kind of block the intelligence, and block that, that we think is true.

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:36.760
 It is meditation, that is. But that is not the way.

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:43.760
 This throughout the Vaidyana teaching, we bring up all this, every beauty in the qualities without

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:43.760
 blocking.

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:50.760
 Use that as growth, and develop, and brighten up our beauty in the nature.

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:56.760
 That is known as Vaidyana teaching. 'Sekalu' means, 'Sekalu' means practice.

00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:01.760
 So that, that can bring up that beauty, anxiety as it is.

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:15.760
 Maintain that quality is then the second unchanging meditation or concentration on the deities.

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:19.760
 Deities. All the, all Buddhas, the 18th century.

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:22.760
 And the 18th century, it is full of love, full of confusion.

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:26.760
 Youthful, smiling, radiating, blessfulness.

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:32.760
 Yet, moment thing of here, it brings up as great confidence.

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:36.760
 It uplifted us, and it shattered our old dark and hesitation.

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:40.760
 Calm in peace and serenity, serenity.

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:44.760
 So calm, so soothing, so appealing.

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:48.760
 Because it's our nature. We're touching to the goal of our nature.

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:51.760
 Nature, beauty.

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:56.760
 It's not just only happy that it brings more that joy and peace.

00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:59.760
 Because the nature, as much as we explore the nature,

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:08.760
 that much it will bring calm, peace, joy, and remove all those unnecessary, unhealthy emotions.

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:10.760
 Really transcendent to that.

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:14.760
 We become therefore, then, great heroes or the heroes.

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:17.760
 And those are known as yogis and yogis.

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:21.760
 That's what it really brings up, that realization.

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:25.760
 So that is really the second nail,

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:29.760
 the nail of the keeping up visualization.

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.760
 All deities.

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:36.760
 The third nail is that,

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:40.760
 and concentrating on the mantras now.

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:48.760
 Because at this time, particularly, we're going to activate our speech

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:50.760
 into something beautiful voice.

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:55.760
 The voice that will uplift ourselves,

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:59.760
 voice that will give the soothing, the calming, the confident,

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:01.760
 and support all the things.

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:04.760
 And that is known as the voice of the Buddha.

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:08.760
 So we're going to bring involved the voice of the enlightenment,

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.760
 voice of the great beings.

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:12.760
 That is the practice of the mantra.

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:17.760
 Mantra is not just a mumbling only ourself something.

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:19.760
 It's true. That is true.

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:27.760
 But mantra is the open, whole beauty of the sound system that exists as sound.

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:32.760
 And again, actually, as I said to you, and you all know, we all know,

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:37.760
 the sound is actually so powerful.

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:42.760
 The form is, we can see, is on tangible levels.

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:48.760
 But sound is, is semi-poem and semi-poemless.

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:49.760
 Sound is.

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:54.760
 For that reason, sound goes deeper than the form.

00:13:54.760 --> 00:14:01.760
 Sound is, in a way, is break between visible and invisible.

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:09.760
 It goes. And the sound is therefore, sound is break, break between our body and our mind.

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:10.760
 Mind.

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:13.760
 Because it's so connected to our mind.

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:17.760
 Yet it's also connected to our physical.

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:20.760
 This is generally every sound is like that.

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:22.760
 External sound is true.

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:24.760
 It's very much connected.

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:30.760
 For that reason, in the Vedayana teaching, sound is so powerful.

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.760
 Sound is so special.

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:35.760
 And the sound is connected also with wind.

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:38.760
 Wind is the part of the sound.

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:47.760
 So therefore, this time, we are going to highlight and pause to purify this sound,

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:52.760
 as I said, to the sound of the enlightenment, sound of the Buddha.

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:55.760
 To begin that, that again.

00:14:55.760 --> 00:15:01.760
 Let's begin with us, not from outside, but living within ourselves.

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:06.760
 And now, we're going to see the essence in the teaching mechanism here.

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:10.760
 And what it is, part of the sound.

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:12.760
 Sound in the center of the heart.

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:16.760
 We visualize sun and moon looking.

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:18.760
 In the middle of the moon, sun and moon looking.

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:22.760
 This sun and moon are also rainbow.

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:29.760
 And also, this sun and moon are great blissfulness.

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:36.760
 And this sun and moon are the union of the skill movement and worship, as I said before.

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:38.760
 That is what it is.

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:40.760
 It's blissfulness.

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:41.760
 Nature is blissfulness.

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:42.760
 It's random.

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:43.760
 It's worshipfulness.

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:49.760
 And the middle of that block, as in the teaching, you see, the bomb syllables.

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:52.760
 Bomb syllable is love.

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:54.760
 Bomb syllable is compassion.

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:58.760
 Bomb syllable is our consciousness, or our essence of the mind.

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:03.760
 Bomb syllable is essence, therefore is essence of the wind energy, too.

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:04.760
 It's essence.

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:08.760
 It's for that reason, in the way the other teacher often said,

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:16.760
 it is the organ of nature, the organ of un-drying nature, unending nature.

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:21.760
 It's purely pure and divine.

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:23.760
 It is enlightened.

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:27.760
 This is the essence of our intelligence.

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:30.760
 It's five verses, or the verses that are combined.

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:34.760
 This bomb syllable is appeared as bomb syllables now.

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:36.760
 Bomb.

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:43.760
 And the bomb syllable, kara is, this time, as teaching said, white and red-edged kara.

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:49.760
 This bomb syllable is circled by these mantras, mantras.

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:52.760
 It's chondrokala-wise movement.

00:16:52.760 --> 00:17:02.760
 And it is moving as like rotating unendingly in self-residing.

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:08.760
 And at the same time, it's moving as ripples, continuing.

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:17.760
 Whereas the spirals, continuing moving, it is rainbow song, wisdom song, a period.

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:25.760
 And then it went to everywhere, where it is also now with great light coming.

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:30.760
 Light, those are the, as in the teaching said here, the emanating light,

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:34.760
 and pervading all the stable and moving entities.

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:36.760
 Everything is pervaded.

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:42.760
 That means the energy and power of the mantra is pervaded to all this,

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:44.760
 every phenomenal existence.

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:47.760
 It's this, the color of this is light.

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:51.760
 Only five different colors and multiple lights.

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:57.760
 White, red, yellow, blue, green, and all combination lights.

00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:58.760
 That's imminent.

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:02.760
 Everything becomes "S" in the next page.

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:07.760
 That's it. Everything becomes as totally as it is,

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:11.760
 that now really truly we begin to see that.

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:17.760
 Everything, the whole homes are divine homes, or the Buddha homes.

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:21.760
 All the sound systems are voice of the Buddhas.

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:26.760
 And all the openness aspects are the totally great,

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:33.760
 promote your wisdom status. That all are within the great blissful status.

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:38.760
 Everything in that manner are exclusive and totally shimmering,

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:43.760
 revering, and everything is sparking in that status.

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:46.760
 And then you reside in these mantras.

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:52.760
 So concentrate on that, that as your concentration,

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:56.760
 maintain your mind and completely reside in these mantras.

00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:05.760
 This is basically known as the thumbnail or the pillar of the mantras,

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:07.760
 or concentration of the mantras.

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:10.760
 But now what you reside in the mantras here?

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:13.760
 You reside in the mantras, again,

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:24.760
 is this, I think, 14 syllables.

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:29.760
 This is generally not created by the Buddha Shakyamuni,

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:33.760
 nor is not created by the Gopin Masambhava

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:35.760
 or the wisdom Dakini Shubham.

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:39.760
 It is self-reflective, echoes of the wisdom

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:42.760
 that's reflected from the bomb syllables.

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:45.760
 It's self-reflective words.

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:48.760
 Therefore, it is separate worlds.

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:51.760
 As it arises in the Buddha's blessings,

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:54.760
 the Gopin Masambhava's blessings are empowered,

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.760
 and the Buddha's power is empowered.

00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:58.760
 And the Ikhim Swami is empowered,

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:00.760
 His Holiness Dhanurumuni is empowered.

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:06.760
 Therefore, it is separate syllables that are full of blessings.

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:10.760
 Full of blessings, because it is a powerful world.

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:12.760
 How they can be empowered?

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:16.760
 Because the Buddha is totally enlightened.

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:19.760
 The Gopin Masambhava is totally enlightened,

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:21.760
 and the Ikhim Swami is so full.

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:25.760
 Therefore, there, what the Buddha said,

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:28.760
 is not blessed with the conceptions,

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:31.760
 not blessed with the dualities,

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:34.760
 not blessed by the emotions,

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:37.760
 such as anger, jealous, heavy thoughts,

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:41.760
 or residues of those, those, or habit dependence of those.

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:47.760
 It's totally free, free, built from all those negative moods,

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:53.760
 because they transcend everything to the ordinary state of the great Western states.

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:59.760
 Within that status, pouring out power and abilities,

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:01.760
 strength of love and compassion,

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:07.760
 what comes to this world is already self-reflective song of the true nature.

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:12.760
 Together with it is a blessing by such great enlightened beings.

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:17.760
 And therefore, this is separate world, special world.

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:20.760
 It's not just regular worlds.

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:23.760
 It has power, it is blessed, blessed.

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:29.760
 It is then ability to cleanse and purify all the obscurations,

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:33.760
 negatives, as we child, as we recite the mantra.

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:36.760
 The aside from the mantra is not just happening only

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:39.760
 on the body of our mouth and our tongues,

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:45.760
 but that energy of operation is going through all the system of the bodies.

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:48.760
 According to the Buddha's teaching or the Vayayana teaching,

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:53.760
 all the channels and all the chakras and all the wind,

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:57.760
 the energies and all the essence element of the body

00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:01.760
 and our weight is completely saturated by that vowels

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:04.760
 or completely sucked in that status.

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:11.760
 Therefore, it has great vowels, healing, uplifting, cleansing, purification,

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:15.760
 and discover our true and beauty as it is,

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:20.760
 because this is so powerful, so spiritual.

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:23.760
 And as we join this mantra, and again,

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:27.760
 concentrating our mind with the balm syllables

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:30.760
 and as well as these mantras.

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:34.760
 Mantras are circling on this balm syllable,

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:36.760
 this translucent status.

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:40.760
 Balm is the translucent or the translucent or the rainbow body or rainbow.

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:44.760
 And then all these mantras are also in that status.

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:49.760
 It is in our heart center, in our heart center,

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:52.760
 in the center of the heart chakras right there.

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:57.760
 And the balm is standing up and then these mantras are,

00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:02.760
 garlanded mantras are moving counterclockwise.

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:06.760
 Actually, his only Buddha who didn't see or in the teaching

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:10.760
 didn't see counterclockwise way or clockwise way.

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:15.760
 But mostly, female Buddha's teaching mentioned always,

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:17.760
 it's counterclockwise.

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:21.760
 So I think it's okay to visualize as counterclockwise way.

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:26.760
 Because since he didn't met any kind of distinctions,

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:28.760
 either way, it must be okay.

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:31.760
 So what we do is counterclockwise way.

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:36.760
 But each syllable is standing, each syllable is light.

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:39.760
 Each syllable has the power of everything,

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:41.760
 every syllables in a way.

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:45.760
 Every syllables power who cares by that one syllables,

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:49.760
 yet all combined token, not just separated,

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:51.760
 all are light.

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:54.760
 Standing up, everything is song of the wisdom,

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:57.760
 song of the blessfulness, song of love,

00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:00.760
 song of the compare here or the syllable of love,

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:03.760
 syllable of compare here, syllable of once,

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:05.760
 wisdom, syllable of blessfulness.

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:08.760
 They're light, they're active.

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:11.760
 And full active status and active status.

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:15.760
 And then as you join, mantra is moving forward.

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:17.760
 And where is this mantra is moving forward?

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:21.760
 As in the teaching, he said in the last line,

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:22.760
 "Amening light."

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:27.760
 Each of those syllables are emanating.

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:30.760
 Five dollars and beams of all the multiple light

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:33.760
 is emanating one after another.

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:39.760
 It's ongoing, unending or unending.

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:43.760
 Ending light and power and blessing

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:47.760
 is continually engaging, moving,

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:49.760
 post-beginning to our heart center

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:52.760
 and then continually expanding to all our jakonas,

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:55.760
 channels, and then wind.

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:57.760
 And then continually moving,

00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:00.760
 that's sparking one after another as moving forward.

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:03.760
 Then to have this external world and phenomena.

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:07.760
 And as he said, it provided all the song systems.

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:10.760
 It provided all the form systems of the phenomena.

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:14.760
 It provided all the space systems of phenomena.

00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:18.760
 Everything is transformed into the craft, the provided.

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:21.760
 Everything is transformed into the same flavor,

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:25.760
 same gauntlet, same identity of these mantras.

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:31.760
 Love, compassion, wisdom, and great blessfulness

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:35.760
 really appear as form, song, and space.

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:39.760
 That is why there is this total element.

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:45.760
 And then continually decide these mantras.

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:47.760
 When you decide these mantras,

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:53.760
 as he said the other day too,

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:56.760
 decide these mantras without any error,

00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:59.760
 and also in him favor in the teaching he said here too,

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:02.760
 repeat these mantras without any errors.

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:05.760
 Trying to keep up that.

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:07.760
 Of course at the beginning of our meditation,

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:11.760
 our concentration is not so stable.

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:14.760
 Therefore we can make errors and mistakes.

00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:16.760
 But this is called practice.

00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:22.760
 We should keep adding joy for effort, joy, and trying to be correct.

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:25.760
 Because that is known as practice makes perfect.

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:28.760
 Practice will bring perfect mistakes.

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:30.760
 It fulfills our goal.

00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:32.760
 We shouldn't think, oh I can't do this.

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:35.760
 Oh it's too much. My concentration is not good.

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:37.760
 And we use that excuses.

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:40.760
 We are discolored ourself.

00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:42.760
 This is the form of laziness.

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:44.760
 They are called the Buddha teaching.

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:46.760
 Discolored is laziness.

00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:48.760
 We use that as scapegoats.

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:54.760
 Using that excuse and then devaluing ourself deep down.

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:56.760
 Deep down, that is not.

00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:58.760
 Everyone has the potential.

00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:01.760
 Everyone has capabilities as Buddha said.

00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:04.760
 Great his kindness teaches it.

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:06.760
 We all have the Buddha nature.

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:10.760
 We all have the same nature as Buddha has

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:12.760
 and Guru P Vayma Mahas.

00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:14.760
 And of course we are finishing 25th.

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:19.760
 What is lacking? Lacking our joy for effort.

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:21.760
 Our courage, commitment.

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:24.760
 That pulling out because you want it.

00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:26.760
 That pull out don't.

00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:33.760
 But otherwise we are saying what they did, why we know.

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:35.760
 And Buddha opened widely.

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:39.760
 What's called democratic system.

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:42.760
 We can choose what we want.

00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:45.760
 It's not something that we rely somewhere else.

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:48.760
 Sick, messy, messy.

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:50.760
 We have the full cover bullet.

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:51.760
 Full potential.

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:53.760
 Let weight of our potential.

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:55.760
 Let weight of our cover bullet.

00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:59.760
 Let weight of our hidden courage and commitment.

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:05.760
 We should not use any excuses.

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:07.760
 And then that is what.

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:11.760
 Therefore with joy, with great appreciation.

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:12.760
 We practice.

00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:14.760
 And in arrows of those, for example,

00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:17.760
 first arrows of the way when we join the mantras.

00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:20.760
 What did Buddha said in the teaching series?

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:25.760
 He said not too fast. Not too slow.

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:29.760
 Not too low. Not yet also too soft.

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:33.760
 Just keep the same rhythms. Same rhythms.

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:37.760
 Rhythms and not adding any syllables.

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:41.760
 Not missing any syllables.

00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:43.760
 Or shortening any syllables.

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:47.760
 Everything exactly the same as this is.

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:50.760
 And then with love, with joy.

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:56.760
 And then of course there is at least three different ways to recite the mantras.

00:28:56.760 --> 00:29:02.760
 And the first way to recite the mantras is of course you have to remember these mantras.

00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:03.760
 To do that.

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:07.760
 So with that when you remember these mantras or memorize these mantras,

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:10.760
 then there is three ways to recite the mantras.

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:16.760
 And the fourth way is known as the interpretation of the mantras with this silence.

00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:20.760
 Very soft silence.

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:26.760
 And the second, my interpretation of the mantras is the mental relaxation, repetitions.

00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:32.760
 And the third repetition is sugaring, what is called?

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:37.760
 Whispering. Whispering. Whispering repetition mantras.

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:40.760
 So there is three different ways.

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:48.760
 Always the great master, everyone said, repeat the mantra with the almost whispered mantras.

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:58.760
 That even the scholar always said the high tune or the frequency of our repetition,

00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:06.760
 that if the scholar is someone, the scholar can hear.

00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:10.760
 So that means it is very whispered mantra.

00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:14.760
 But whether you do, whatever this repetitive mantra you do,

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:21.760
 same thing, not missing, not adding, extra, and not hard, not low,

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:24.760
 keep the same, rather than that.

00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:25.760
 That is it.

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:28.760
 We continue reciting this mantra.

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:32.760
 Well, you recited this mantras and then occasionally,

00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:38.760
 bring more joy, more devotions, highlighted the spotlight

00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:42.760
 or highlight of the joy, joy in your devotees.

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:49.760
 And occasionally, bring more love and kindness, compare it with all the living beings.

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:55.760
 And occasionally, just relax that open state, the first meditation,

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:58.760
 first the uncheckable will.

00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:07.760
 Relax this open, which I think this mantra freely without any thought and consumption.

00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:11.760
 And sometimes, concentrate on the image of the ego.

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:17.760
 For example, when she has one face, two arms, two legs, smiling, joyfully face,

00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:20.760
 and concentrating on that as a translucent state.

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:23.760
 Or what's the rainbow body's face?

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:29.760
 If those style and reciting mantra is then concentrated.

00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:32.760
 Concentrated on the mantras.

00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:42.760
 Mantra or the nail, thumbnail of the reciting mantras

00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:46.760
 or the pillar of the concentrate of the mantras.

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:52.760
 Once you did this first nail, second nail,

00:31:52.760 --> 00:32:00.760
 and thumbnail, thumbnail, then the fourth nail that you can apply.

00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:07.760
 Those are known as the emanating and gathering, gatherings.

00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:13.760
 Generally, this is again highlighted, emphasizing of the particular activity

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:17.760
 that you are performing during your repetitions.

00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:25.760
 And actually, what is this activity?

00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:28.760
 It is activity of the Buddhas.

00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:32.760
 Buddha, when you read enlightenment, what is to do?

00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:35.760
 It's benefiting to all the living beings.

00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:40.760
 Remove their obstacles, diseases, sicknesses, and purple their wishes.

00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:46.760
 Bring out everything into this enlightened state, calm and peace and joy.

00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:50.760
 And a soothing status. That is what the activity is.

00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:55.760
 So, in this case, you are going to meditate.

00:32:55.760 --> 00:33:01.760
 Meditate. Meditating, that activity is happening.

00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:03.760
 That activity is happening.

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:07.760
 In order to do this, then, from the heart center,

00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:18.760
 again, these bomb syllables, syllables, these mantras, emanating larger lights.

00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:24.760
 Larger lights, and we have particularly designated for the targeted beings,

00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:27.760
 and that light went to those beings.

00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:31.760
 And whatever their suffering, difficulties, immediately removed,

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:37.760
 accidentally, as when sunlight comes, that moment, darkness go on.

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:43.760
 Similarly, that powerful light came, the healing light came,

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:48.760
 and immediately removed all that difficulty, troubles, sufferings.

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:52.760
 And then, same time, fulfill all the wishes, whatever,

00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:55.760
 in the context of both each other.

00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:59.760
 Fulfilling the wishes of every living being to help to other beings.

00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:03.760
 To fulfill their goal in the context of happy, joy.

00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:07.760
 Not fulfilling the wishes of to harm something, or to disturb something,

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:12.760
 but benefit, bring everything to the happy, peace, joy.

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:14.760
 That is the fault of them.

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:20.760
 So that all activities are known as the emanating,

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:24.760
 the beneficial activity that emanated for all beings.

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:27.760
 And then, as well as this following line,

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:32.760
 has said the repetition of the activities in this next bit.

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:35.760
 Try to react, I will do that later to you, later to you.

00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:38.760
 But this, that also happens.

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:42.760
 All these four activities, by this, fulfilling all harm.

00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:47.760
 Even though you're not really applying this mantra, this practice immediately,

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:49.760
 but it's happening.

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:53.760
 Fulfilling all the activities as these four different activities,

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:57.760
 all multiple different activities, the beneficial activities,

00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:01.760
 are really immediately achieving to every living being.

00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:06.760
 And then, as well as also, it's not just others, but also ours.

00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:10.760
 It is removing all our obstacles, hindrance, difficult troubles,

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:12.760
 emotional problems, whatever we are facing,

00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:17.760
 instantly removed, totally healed, cleaned, or physically troubled,

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:20.760
 mentally troubled, emotionally troubled, psychological troubled,

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:26.760
 all other things are faced, instantly removed, and put a fight, completely damaged.

00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:32.760
 And then, same time, that gathering, all that light went when it went,

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:35.760
 and finally is returned back to you.

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:38.760
 So it is continuing ongoing activities.

00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:43.760
 That's going out, and emanate, bring back that light, in a way.

00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:47.760
 And when it comes back that light, and it changes it, that moment,

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:50.760
 even your power of the verse of the Dakini hymn soya,

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:54.760
 already in the power of state, but it kind of glorified again,

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:59.760
 most explained, yet another, we can have great confidence,

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:02.760
 that we prefer to go, we are in that state as come.

00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:08.760
 It's both great, again re-energized of the realization and practices.

00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:13.760
 So those are what is known as then, these fourth nails.

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:16.760
 So during this meditation of the repetitive mantra,

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:21.760
 we can think those as occasionally changing the visualization,

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:25.760
 changing the concentrate, and highlight those one after another.

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:29.760
 That is known as repeating, reciting the mantas.

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:33.760
 So there is four different sometimes, highlight of the first one,

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:36.760
 then the second one, third one, fourth one, or whatever,

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:40.760
 not exactly that, or one after another, but highlight that.

00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:45.760
 And try to keep our mind among these four,

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:50.760
 during the repetitive mantra, that is known as then the correct meditation,

00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:54.760
 the perfect meditation, and authentic meditation,

00:36:54.760 --> 00:37:00.760
 because our mind didn't go out too much, our range of our practices.

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:04.760
 It remains in the state of the same practices,

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:08.760
 and it's beautiful concentration, beautiful meditation,

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:14.760
 and then structurally we are also, in a way, in a very surface level,

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:19.760
 we are timing the mind, we are timing, we are displaying the mind.

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:24.760
 So that is really of this first part of the mantra.
