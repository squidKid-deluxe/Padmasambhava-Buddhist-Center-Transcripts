00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:04.140
 build this university called tibeti university or the tibeti institute he walked so hard to

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:04.780
 establish

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:12.300
 it is institute and he was the founding members of this great institute at the beginning for so

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:21.660
 much effort at that time himma has department as only nine students and for 10 students that time

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:28.620
 medicine they don't have the college of the two have 10 students only as students he fought for

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:35.660

 nima department that time already raised up about 80 or 80 students he become the second largest

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:57.980
 student among the then the yellow yellow police has more students over 200 that time the nima has

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:06.380
 almost a priority the hundred or 80 or 80 students becoming the second biggest because his hard

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:06.940
 ball

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:15.340
 his his effort for so much effort that how that work and then when he left the institute and he

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:22.140
 continued to walk as he said but around the world and around all the world he went he did the

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:28.220
 authentic buddhist he did it with delusions taking but he kept the authentic essential

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:35.100
 as the quality is terrible exactly as yesterday as did in tibeti as during his great teachers in

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:35.420
 india

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:43.260
 now he kept the same syllables not not the rooted or compromising that he kept authenticity and

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:51.020
 all over the world and complete all those benefits and complete all these benefits and activities

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:57.420
 with this then he entered mahapar in manana and he ate seven fruits he come to that when he entered

00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:05.020
 mahapar in the manas and he will sign in the education what he built and what he saw so it

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:11.340
 witnessed by the teachings and the chapters as great master when he entered mahapar in the manan

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:17.500
 during the practice and not just the master name of the master but true master master who kept the

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:23.740
 dharma so close to their heart heart will they enter their practice today in an actualizer will

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:29.020

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:35.340
 tantra teachings in the minutes of the teachings and he appeared entirely as a ghost he validated

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:40.540
 for four days in half and that was right time before the time in the city weapons every still

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:46.930
 longer time we didn't worry because in the country law don't allow to keep the body no matter

00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:47.420
 whoever

 there can't allow to keep boarding for long time we know that touching and all those instructions

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:58.160
 we have to follow a qadat dharma but we worry how we do we have to do the spiritual prayer to

00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:58.940
 release

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:04.140
 the meditation states that we taught to do those things the end of all those time and right that

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:10.780
 time exciting time he came out of the meditations and during that time there is a sound efforts

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:19.740

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:25.180
 come during the meditator his compartment was so bright so plain and so youthful status

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:32.140
 status and that is the great this thinking by the heroines when we look to back his life life

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:32.780

 they used to give form of the banner of the teaching he truly did these things things he

00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:38.860
 gave the teachings and as he gave the teachings and also he begged that teaching not just the

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:44.220
 teaching that he gave the like scholarly ways and just giving some lectures to everyone but he

00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:50.060
 talked from his heart his knowledge his realization he gave met every student understandably

00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:55.980
 made understandable not just a wake talk and then left the places he stayed behind the wall

00:17:55.980 --> 00:18:01.580
 the teaching what he said make sure that everyone has to understand what the teaching is what the

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:07.420
 meaning is whatever the topic is whether is the minaya topic whether is the sukara topic whether

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:12.700
 is the abhidharma teaching or whether is related with those teachings about by the great masters

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:21.580
 master he completed made understandable those teachings and then he composed so many books

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:29.580
 in it to be to be in style he voted about three volumes that covers the different part

00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:35.340
 the different aspects and topics of the buddha teachings as the best on the nayana teachings

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:42.060
 all three basket of teachings such as sutra of vinaya sutra and abhidharma all the medayana

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:42.620
 teachings

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:51.900
 teachings or as well as in nayana teachings a holy nayana teaching that covers all those nayana

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:58.620
 teachings that books all in so to say three volumes in a very languages and over 30 books

00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:06.780
 that he wrote wrote wrote in english and spanish and russian languages languages and those are

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:13.260
 well beautifully presented teaching according to what they can understand as they said as his

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:19.020
 teaching was so clear distant and meant more meaningful more adaptable more understandable

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:23.900
 teaching is going to foreign countries not just the teaching is going to the old the

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:28.620
 gradients those who are practically presented by the kindness and the greatness of the

00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:34.060
 mora penma sambhava kentu so that the great master shandaraka they established and so on so many

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:40.300
 great masters uphold that teaching so teaching was continually established well bonded in the

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:45.820
 debating mentality in the debated brains but teaching goes into the different countries

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:51.820
 and that this is not the same way way so therefore his message the teachings are so

00:19:51.820 --> 00:20:00.620
 played as simple as can be adopted by whoever read those books whoever read and practice they can

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:06.060
 pretty much can follow with those things so you know all those little things things so this is

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:12.860
