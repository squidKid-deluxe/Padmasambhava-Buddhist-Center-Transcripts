00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.280
 The seven-line prayer in Tibetan and English, and then a minute of meditation, and then we begin.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 [Singing]

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 [Singing continues]

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 [Singing continues]

00:01:43.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 [Singing continues]

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 [Singing continues]

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 [Singing continues]

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.990
 And so the floor is now open for you to ask questions, so Rinpoche, about your practice, your study

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000
,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 if you are in discussion, book discussion group, whatever is uppermost on your mind. Thank you.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 But not strong market. I don't know any of those indexes in the back and forth, any of those.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 I only know that [inaudible]

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 I have a question about the three kyas, and from the root text on, I guess, it's page 35.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.270
 It says, "Do not reject the thoughts, see them as dharmakaya." Could you say something about the

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:54.000
 three kyas and how they relate to us?

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.990
 Three kyas, generally, of course, is something that all the Mahayana and Vedayana practitioners

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:11.000
 goal to achieve, realization of the three kyas.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:22.320
 The dharmakaya and the sambhokaya, and the nirmakaya, those three kyas, they are also externally

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.000
 existing dharmakaya,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.380
 such as known as the Buddha Samyandabhadra, and then dharmakaya, sambhokaya Buddha, such as the

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:35.000
 Buddha Vaidya Sattva.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 The makaya Buddha, such as the Buddha Shakyamuni, those are known as the Buddhas of the three kyas.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:55.670
 But according to the Zokhi level, the ultimate level, the three kyas, is not just only the external

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.000
, existing, or that we see,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:07.880
 but naturally inherited to all of us, that three kyas, because in the Buddha's teaching, everyone

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.000
 inherits the Buddha's nature.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:19.010
 Everyone has the opportunity to become the Buddha and they can achieve the dharmakaya, the sambhok

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.000
aya, and the nirmakaya.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 So then, where is that? Where is that three kyas now?

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:36.290
 And then that is when it comes, then there are no other, any other places except our mind, three ky

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:38.000
as in our mind.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:47.300
 And so in the Zokhi teaching, what is that dharmakaya? It is our nature of the mind, nature of the

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:48.000
 mind.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:57.320
 Mind has generally three qualities. It has three qualities known as the emptiness, the clarity, and

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.000
 the displace.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 Those are the really that we can experience the three qualities of the mind.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 So these three, nature is no other than the three kyas.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 So the emptiness aspect of the nature of the mind is dharmakaya.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.000
 The clarity aspect of the nature of the mind is sambhokaya.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 And then the display, that means the arising thought, all these thoughts are dharmakayas.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 So therefore, mind is the ultimate level, mind is the embodiment of the three kyas.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 And therefore, in the Zokhi teaching, always in the teaching series,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 then what do you say? There is something, that quotation, you read that? What is it?

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 This is from the root text. It says, "Do not reject the thoughts, see them as dharmakaya."

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:11.000
 That's true. So rejecting thought, rejecting thought is what that actually really means.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 According again to the ultimate level, you are discriminating.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 You want something, you don't want something.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 Wanting and not wanting is discrimination.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 And ultimately, wanting and not wanting is then dualities, is the ego tricks.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:38.000
 Therefore, don't reject thought. And also, don't stop in thought.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:46.090
 Then in the Zokhi teaching, I'm sure it's there too, always said, "Let it come, let it go, let it

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:47.000
 be."

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 That is what really is the nature. Because when thought comes, you're not making any effort,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
 or nobody is making any effort to come towards.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:05.000
 The thoughts are coming naturally. And also, if you don't hold that,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 naturally thought goes away. It's not going to stay.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 In a way, is that thought happening in the state of emptiness?

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:23.000
 What that means? Have you looked at where thought is existing?

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
 Where it comes from, where it's existing, where it's went?

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 There is no any pinpoint location that you can see at all.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 And that is in the Buddha teaching or the Zokhi teaching known as dharmakaya.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 That is the basic nature of everything.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 But that nature is with us. Therefore, if we meditate and practice continually,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 and do good things, then discover good things means also nothing is going to be able to be alien,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000
 or anything that is beside our goodness of nature.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:07.000
 Bring more love, more kindness, more compassion, and let that come, let that be,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 let that display and then continually come, enjoying the moment.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 Then that is known as you're relaxing, enjoying the beauty of the nature of our mind,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000
 the beauty of the nature of others, or externally.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000
 - Thank you. - Okay.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 - Thank you. - Thank you.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:43.000
 Good morning, Prinpoche again. Where does karma begins? Does it begin in our thoughts?

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 - Yeah. - Does your thoughts have karma effect?

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 Karma begins from thought. Really karma is, I mean, again, in the Buddha teaching,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 that the Buddha's first teaching is called poor noble truth.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 I mean, you all know poor noble truth.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
 That's suffering truth, cause of suffering truth,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000
 and the path truth, cessation truth.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 So, this cause of suffering truth is the beginning of the karma, karma.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
 And that, what is that cause of suffering truth is?

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:29.000
 Is negative emotions and it is activities.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:37.000
 Negative emotions is a fundamental cause or the root of the karma.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 And that negative emotion comes from what?

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 Then every go back, it comes from, most of the time, ego clings.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 And that way is ego clings from, is dualities.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 Where duality comes from is comes from ignorance.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:05.000
 Where ignorance comes from is comes grasping, clinging.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 The clinging is the root of the troubles.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
 Where is that clinging?

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 There is no way you can point. Nothing you can see.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 So it is coming from emptiness.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 Emptiness is happening in the emptiness and is dissolving,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 merging back to the emptiness.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 That duality is our own, nobody forces us,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 but our own habit pattern with the mistakenly or the ignorancely,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
 we begin grasping, clinging.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:52.760
 And then it creates more and is igniting or what's called clashing back and forth in the mental

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:53.000
 state.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 It creates a publication and it becomes known as ego clinging.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000
 It is one of the clinging truths. Ego is one of the clinging.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 And then that becomes more kind of, more expanded.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 And then is all those negative emotions, five poses and so forth.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:17.000
 And then activity of the five poses as we join in a prayer of the conjugate,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
 then all those creation comes.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 All those troubles are then one after another is coming.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 That's like nightmare dreams.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000
 Yes?

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:41.000
 You once spoke of how the afflictive emotions and the five poisons

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 are misunderstanding of the correlating wisdom.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.000
 Would you speak a little about how our emotions

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 are just a misunderstanding of the ignorance of the wisdom therein?

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 Again, even though we say negative emotion, I mean negative emotion is bad.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 But negative emotions, if you think, the nature of the negative,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 there's nothing really, if you look at those emotions, there's nothing existing.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 There's nothing, even for example, raging anger comes.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
 It is a big disturbance.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
 It's disturbing one's own peaceful mind status.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
 It's disturbing others.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 But where is that anger?

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:41.000
 If you look as a lakshaki teacher or as a religious teacher, Buddha pointed out,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000
 there's nothing really existing at all, at all.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 We are grasping.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 What is magic? We're grasping.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
 We get that emotion. We're holding onto that.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000
 We get more. That means we're keeping up that fuel.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 And not just the fuel, we're more airing that, getting excellent,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 segregating back and forth that.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 And that is the same nature of all the emotions too.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 For that reason, in the Dokhi teaching, often he said,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
 "Liberating. Liberated it."

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.000
 And to where? To the wisdom status.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 And also, wisdom is not something solid existing there is.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:30.000
 It exists, but it's a trap that distributes.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 Instead that it brings new energy in the mental status.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:41.000
 Calm and peace, more soothing, more understanding.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 So therefore, it's called wisdom.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:52.000
 Then you go, each of those negative emotions is known as the five wisdom.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 The five poisons are the nature of the five.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 The five poisons are the nature of the five wisdom,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 or there are five wisdom.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:12.000
 And so, then, this anger is the wisdom of the merrily wisdom.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
 Anger is merrily wisdom.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 And jealous is all accomplishing wisdom.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 And then, the wisdom of attachment is

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 the wisdom of discrimination, awareness of wisdom.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 And the arrogance is the wisdom of the economic wisdom.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 Then, the fifth one is the ignorance.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 The ignorance is known as the wisdom of the dharma-dhatu,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 or dharma-dhatu wisdom.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:02.000
 So those are the five wisdom with the activating,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
 outreaching to the externally.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 Realistically, all those are, really, there is nothing solid existing at all.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
 And therefore, all is within the dharma-caya status,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
 or dharma-dhatu status, wisdom.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.000
 So therefore, even though there are so big disturbances of these emotions,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:28.000
 if you handle that so nicely, and that's why many times in the Dzokhi teaching

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
 said as much as the emotions are bigger, that much is our,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 our systems are growing.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
 That if you can handle that, then of course, if you can't handle,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:44.000
 then as much as emotion comes, that might become the disturbances.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 Thank you so much.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
 Thank you.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
 Cheers.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 Okay.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
 Good morning, Rinpoche.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:06.000
 When the body dies, and the soul, or rikpa, separates from the body,

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:14.000
 how long can it remain separated before it decides to reincarnate?

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 That, darling, according to the teaching,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
 that decision is not really real American decision.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:29.000
 I mean, only who can make the decision is those people who had good stabilization

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
 of the meditation, or good practitioners.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000
 They can make some decisions, or when they're going to reincarnate,

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 or when they're going to take the rebirth.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 But otherwise, majority people are, there's no, can't have any choices.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
 Follow in the karma.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 That's really karmic wind.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
 Follow in the karmic wind.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
 So, for that reason, according to the teaching,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 the maximum average and the minimum average.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000
 And maximum average, according to the teaching,

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:14.000
 after the people died, and their consciousness can stay for 49 days.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
 That is the average maximum.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.000
 Minimum average is three days.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
 That is the minimum average.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000
 And then, between that, again, of course, is karma.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 And some individuals could say, but very soon, not just three days, very soon,

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000
 some individuals, due to the karma, again, can stay a long time,

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 according to the teaching, even after 49 days.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 So, this is all karmic wind, then, now.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:56.000
 Mostly, it's really completely controlled, regulated by one's own karmas, most of the time.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 Thank you.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000
 Thank you, Jane.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:16.000
 Rumbuchi, at the prayer, sometimes we are free from four extremes.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.000
 So, existing, non-existing, both and neither.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.000
 Could you please, both and neither,

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:32.000
 or the situations one practitioner may encounter during our practice of the view,

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000
 that we talked a lot about existing and non-existing,

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:42.000
 but both and neither, how could that happen to a practitioner?

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:50.000
 This is what is known as, when you practice, or when you're studying,

00:19:50.000 --> 00:20:00.000
 the Buddha teaching is called, known as vu, vu, vu, meditation,

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000
 and then, result of the achievement and conduct.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000
 So, this existing, non-existing, neither, neither,

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:17.000
 is generally more applied to the view.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.000
 The view is what you're really going to meditate, meditate.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000
 So, what is the view?

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 The view is, that view is, of course, what you meditate, according to Buddhism,

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:36.000
 you meditate on the true nature, true nature of the,

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 where there is an external phenomena, or where there is an inner mind, or mind.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:51.000
 So, let's talk with more kind of practical way, simple way, to talk with the mind.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:21:02.000
 So, now, mind is free from existing, non-existing, neither, and either.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:07.000
 That means, is also, this is generally in the Buddha teaching,

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:13.000
 what you all know that, related truth and absolute truth.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:20.000
 Meditation is, when you meditate, we're engaging with absolute truth.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 So, absolute truth of the nature of the mind is free from that,

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000
 for extremes, or for that.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:38.000
 So, now, when we look up that to the mind, to apply that to the mind,

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:44.000
 mind is existing, or mind is not existing.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:52.000
 Have you asked that question, and what you have the answer?

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000
 What you have the answer? What do we have the answer?

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000
 Is really mind existing?

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.000
 Have somebody asked, is mind existing?

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:09.000
 Of course, we will say, yes, mind is existing, but where is mind?

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:14.000
 That is Krishna, because you're going to say, yes, existing.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 Of course, everyone will say, but where is that?

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:28.000
 So, what then, what we will find, or what will be our answer? Where is that?

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:33.000
 So, that is, when there is nothing, the answer is not that nothing, we don't.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:41.000
 According to the teaching, it's not something that we are dumb, that we didn't pound.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 Because we are so smart, that's why we didn't pound.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000
 Really, for therefore reason, what did he say there?

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.000
 In the Buddha teaching, he said, when you don't find, that is greater pound.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000
 Yeah, that is greater pound.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:04.000
 So, then now, we say there is no, not existing mind, in reality level, absolute levels.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:13.000
 But then, if we say, oh, there is no mind at all, then our, all these intelligence are coming.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000
 All these thoughts are coming.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 Where then, if there is no mind, where is the coming?

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 Coming.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000
 So, then what we answer again, where is the coming?

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:34.000
 So, for that reason, it is also, mind is preformed, not existing.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:40.000
 So, it is existing, so preformed existing and preformed non-existing.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000
 So, it is true.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:48.000
 There is nothing really we can, we can pinpoint where mind is coming.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.000
 So, that's what is called preformed existing and non-existence.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000
 I mean, that is what.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.000
 And then, neither said.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 And then, mind is, any of those neither means, so then mind is existing, non-existing.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 If this is the one, it is something that is existing, also non-existing.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000
 But where is then that?

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:25.000
 Where is that? It's just only the mind, the conception, the duality is trying to hold something.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.000
 But there is nothing really we can find.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.000
 Find.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:38.290
 So, therefore, then it is preformed, preformed existing, non-existing, or what's called pre-

00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:40.000
existing, non-existing.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000
 And neither.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:47.000
 Neither, because this is just making you hold like that.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:53.000
 But there is nothing really is existing at all.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:59.000
 And then, if it is, although it is neither either, that, that's the same thing.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:08.320
 If there is no existing, no, it is preformed existing, non-existing, and neither, then either is

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:10.000
 the same thing.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:16.000
 It's just a conception, but there is nothing really, solid, existing, where we can hold.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.000
 Hold.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:23.000
 So, that's what is called, is nature is preformed extremes.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000
 Stream, for that extreme, streams.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000
 And that's what also in the Buddha teaching, in hard sattara.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000
 The same thing, form is the emptiness, emptiness is the form.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000
 It's no other than there is nothing really substantive.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:43.000
 Solid existing, that you can grasp or hold, in any other that can hold.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000
 Hold onto that as existing.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:55.000
 Because this is, as I said, it is examining the absolute truth, how it is.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:00.000
 On the relative truth, yes, it exists in mind.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:06.000
 Existing, and mind is also sometimes not, I mean, all this we can apply the relative truth.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:14.010
 But absolute truth, there is nothing really solid, existing, that either of those we can hold onto

00:26:14.010 --> 00:26:15.000
 that.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:21.000
 And we may discover that, and relax on that status, and continually maintain that.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:26.000
 And that is known as keeping the will, which is meditation.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:33.000
 Thank you.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:38.000
 Thank you very much.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 Related to what you were just speaking about, form is emptiness, and emptiness is form.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:51.000
 On page 34 of the root text, a beautiful, simple sentence.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:51.750
 "Thus awareness, in which appearance and emptiness are inseparably reunited, is the natural

00:26:51.750 --> 00:27:03.000
 sovereign of the three kayas, and the nature of primordial reality."

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:08.000
 Absolutely gorgeous, and it is a restatement of form as emptiness and emptiness is form.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000
 Okay, thank you.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000
 Just one question.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:19.000
 The next sentence is, "The Dharmakaya beyond mind is suchness."

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:27.140
 Could you kindly comment upon the statement by Guru Padmasambhava, the Dharmakaya, this is on page

00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:29.000
 34 of the root text.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:34.000
 "The Dharmakaya beyond mind is suchness."

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:50.000
 Again, Dhukti teaching, according to Dhukti teaching, mind is duality. Mind is duality.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:28:04.000
 Therefore, what is mentioned here is that Dharmakaya is beyond duality, instead mind.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000
 That's what I was missing, mind.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.000
 Yeah, that's it. Mind is.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:18.000
 Therefore, for example, in Dhukti teaching, distinction is between awareness and mind.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000
 Awareness is beyond duality.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:30.100
 In Dhukti teaching, it is translated into English awareness, but in Tibetan word, it is known as r

00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:31.000
upa, rupa.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:38.000
 Rupa is translated into English awareness, but rupa and mind.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:46.000
 Rupa, in Tibetan word, rupa and same, same is mind, same is duality.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:54.000
 Rupa is not duality. It is pristine awareness beyond duality.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:00.000
 So, Dharmakaya is pristine awareness.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:11.360
 Therefore, mind is, awareness is beyond duality, and when you discover that, that is suchness or

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:13.000
 that is Dharmakaya.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000
 Thank you very much.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:24.000
 Okay, thank you. Yes. Thank you. Thank you, Mark.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000
 Thank you, Rupa Jai.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:37.720
 Even though in the Bardo we're basically blown along by karma, I've often wondered if the wisdom

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:42.000
 mind at all has any influence in sort of guiding us

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:53.140
 within the extent of our karma to a rebirth that will somehow help us with whatever it is that we

00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:56.000
're struggling with that's keeping us from reaching enlightenment.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:02.000
 Definitely. According to the teaching, definitely wisdom has a lot of influences.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:10.010
 And particularly when we are practicing this, really there are many opportunities coming to regain

00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:18.000
 so that we can have some stabilization of taking the rebirth of our directions.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:28.100
 And that is, for example, in what those in the teaching said, liberating the enlightenment in the

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:37.110
 moment of death, liberating the enlightenment or getting enlightenment right after death as Dharmak

00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:38.000
aya said.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:50.390
 And then after that, getting enlightenment in the Sambokaya state and then getting enlightenment or

00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:57.000
 the high, nice kind of rebirth in the Narmakaya state.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:03.380
 Also during that Bardo, those are really making so that there's so many opportunities, particularly

00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:10.000
 being as practitioners that even though we didn't get highest realization within these lifetimes,

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:21.000
 but due to the practices that really we can get a lot of opportunities and can turn that direction.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:29.110
 And that is in the teaching said, for example, moment of death, and then all those transitions

00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:35.000
 coming, according, of course, there are many ways to passing us.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:41.000
 But majority is, again, kind of graduations and graduations.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:47.850
 So therefore, then each time, those are like different element of the dissolving. So this element

00:31:47.850 --> 00:31:55.000
 of the dissolving, that time with different experiences, many different things, externally,

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000
 internally, and then more kind of secret level.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:05.710
 So really, we are good practitioners. Those indications, those inner signs are immediately kind of

00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:12.000
 indicating that now we are in the process of the living or changing our situation.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:18.910
 So they're re-stabilizing of their meditation, their practices, and therefore then they can reach

00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:22.000
 kind of good realization at that moment.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:28.470
 And somehow, if we couldn't, that happened, if we'd been good practitioners practicing zouqin, such

00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:34.000
 as the view, view what we're talking about, zouqin meditation.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:42.020
 And according to the teaching, when we passed away or that moment of death, the three elements are

00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:49.560
 merging, kind of like white element and red element that we obtained from our parents are coming,

00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:51.000
 losing their positions

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:58.640
 and coming in different places. I mean, white element is mainly according to koran chakra and red

00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:03.000
 element that essentially is below, never chakra.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:09.930
 And then that kind of position is losing, kind of one is coming, one is coming down and one is

00:33:09.930 --> 00:33:11.000
 coming down.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:17.330
 And also at that moment, the inner vision that individual is really beginning to experience such

00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:20.000
 everything becomes so kind of white.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:27.000
 Everything is white experience coming, and one is red, his position is losing, coming up.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:33.000
 That individual experiencing such everything becomes so red. Red.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:38.000
 And then this position kind of both come up and don't.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:43.270
 And according to the teaching, it will meet at the heart level, heart center, around heart, and

00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:46.000
 there, then consciousness trapped.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:53.540
 And that moment that individual is experience completely kind of dark and blank states, nothing

00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:57.000
 that, nothing, it's completely that.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:02.000
 And that state is according to the teaching, teaching really won't stay long term.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:08.000
 It's just a poor moment, maybe just like even less than one minute could state that.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:15.000
 It could, again, depend with the individual, but it stays maybe just a short time, very short time.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:24.300
 When that kind of, that, that, that, that the gliding together, that strength lost, lost it, and

00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:26.000
 then it kind of breaks away.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:33.280
 And that moment, now the consciousness become completely single, single, kind of come out of that

00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:34.000
 trap.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:40.330
 And that moment, according to the teaching, in the Dzokhi teaching, said that that time, the

00:34:40.330 --> 00:34:46.800
 individual is experiencing the perfect Dharmakaya, what we're talking, the perfect Dharmakaya

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:49.000
 realization, really.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:58.030
 And brilliant as blue sky, autumn sky, clear, pristine, brilliant that, and we individually have

00:34:58.030 --> 00:35:05.000
 been practicing this lifetime, that kind of like, what you see that moment.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:11.050
 And what you meditate, practice, what you learn that, and kind of immediately connected, that

00:35:11.050 --> 00:35:16.000
 immediately connected by your confidence, you go, oh, this is the realization state.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:23.720
 And that moment that individually really reaching the Dharmakaya status, according, then there's no

00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:26.000
 more part of those that you have to go through.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.000
 Right there, you reach the enlightenment.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:36.170
 So, we couldn't recognize, it's just also short time, and couldn't connect with that, then there's

00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:39.000
 many, many signs will come.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:48.420
 And those are known as light, beams of light, and song. Those, all is not yet externally existing,

00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:52.000
 is all the display of our primordial wisdom.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:58.480
 Light, and that, those are, when it comes, according to the teaching, again, those people who

00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:05.000
 really practice it, such as Dzokhi, like Toga practitioners, if they see that light,

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:11.990
 they really see that, is again one's own display of the nature of the mind. So, immediately, they,

00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:19.000
 instead, like, usually what happens according to the teaching, when those visions come, immediately

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.000
 we react.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:25.000
 Most of the time people reacted, and then they become really big in the nightmares.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:30.730
 It's reacting, right, and the subject, the object, and then somebody will be scared that we like to

00:36:30.730 --> 00:36:35.000
 hide this and that, and then it's kind of, just goes on and on then.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:42.540
 But instead, that moment, those appeared, and then you recognize, as once, only your display of the

00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:50.030
 nature, as the Toga displays, and that moment, then those individuals are really reaching

00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:52.000
 enlightenment in the Sambokaya status.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:59.720
 No more further part of that. Then, if that didn't happen, that, and then according to the teaching

00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:05.920
, then, again, there's many displays will come, one after another, and those all, then the peaceful,

00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:10.000
 wrath of Dzokhi's displays are beginning to coming up, one after another.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:16.080
 And then, in this lifetime, we are really practicing of the, such as the visualization of those Dz

00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:22.800
okhi practices, and then that those images come, whatever the forms come, immediately you kind of

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:29.210
 reconnect it, instead, scared, reject, or instead like to hide, or going away, you kind of merge it

00:37:29.210 --> 00:37:34.000
 with that, and those are then known as, also really, then, it will stop, rebirth.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:39.440
 And then, if it didn't happen, then continually we get all this one after another, kind of, just

00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:47.990
 going, and then, according to the teaching, teaching, you, 49 days, every, that average is 49 days,

00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:55.210
 and it has, I think, five weeks, so, three and a half, three and a half weeks, you get all those

00:37:55.210 --> 00:37:59.000
 regions, one after another, all those regions.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:06.270
 And, after two and a half weeks, and then, it started coming more, how many patterns of the picture

00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:13.820
 of rebirth, where, even if it's taken, that kind of, like, environment is, like, coming up, coming

00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:16.000
 up more, and more, that.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:21.420
 And, if those happened, if those people, he'd have some stabilization of their meditation, and that

00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:25.000
 is called, then you, you're choosing the Narmakaya pattern.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.970
 So, now, you're going to take the rebirth somewhere, but I'm going to take rebirth some of the

00:38:29.970 --> 00:38:36.280
 right places, right, right way, so, kind of, you have some stabilized that, and be with the mind

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:44.870
fulness, and then, take the rebirth, and that's called, like, transforming the Pardo, and the Narmak

00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:47.000
aya Situations, those are known.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:53.670
 So, there's many, many, like, definitely opportunities comes, and what's that, and that, and then,

00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:57.000
 is also our definitely Narmakaya things, too.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.000
 Thank you.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.000
 Thank you.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.000
 Thank you.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.000
 Yes.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.000
 Yes, thank you.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.000
 Hi.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:07.000
 This, Rinpoche, is actually a follow-up question from page 35.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:13.260
 On page 35, it says, people have so many responsibilities in modern times, and then, it goes on to

00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:17.000
 say, you know, how to best practice under the circumstances.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:23.800
 So, can you comment on how we can bring our practice to work, in work-related situations, and maybe

00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:27.000
 an increasingly competitive environment?

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.000
 How do we deal with that?

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:32.000
 We still have to work with other people.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:37.000
 We need to get, we need to put foot on a table.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:43.000
 So, how do we deal with that on a daily basis, and still keep our humility and our practice?

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:53.000
 Yeah, that is, generally, John, this is, the practice is not out.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:58.000
 Practice is in with our mind. Really, that's it.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:05.730
 Practice, generally, is not the way out you look, but practice is ultimately for how you take care

00:40:05.730 --> 00:40:07.000
 of your mind.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.000
 That is really the practices, practices.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:17.990
 So, in that way, and of course, externally, you do stay in a meditation, in a room, in a shrine,

00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:21.000
 all those things, is definitely very important.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:31.370
 But, most of the time, we practice transforming our daily activities into dharma because always, as

00:40:31.370 --> 00:40:37.000
 many as you can, there will be the kind of looking to our mind.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:43.000
 Even for a few seconds, really, I think it really will help. Where is my mind?

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:49.190
 And then, sometimes, stress follows all the emotional things in all places. Instead, they are

00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:52.000
 completely saturated to the external focus.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:41:01.000
 But, when you have some quiet time, look inwardly. Take deeper breathing and release.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:08.000
 Long exhale. Breathe, express, and look to your mind. Look to the relax in that network.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:14.000
 And then, also, it can't be like, occasionally, bring out a little more compassion.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:19.360
 So, the body and the head and shoulders. All this is what I'm doing, what I'm trying to do is to

00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:21.000
 benefit to all the senses.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:29.030
 May that help or benefit somehow, really, which transforms that situation into dharma by compassion

00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:31.000
 and the power of the body.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:38.770
 Also, thinking of that in a minute or so, throughout the day, those are all known as really

00:41:38.770 --> 00:41:44.000
 transforming the situation more in dharma way than that.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.000
 And so, that is really it.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:52.020
 But, whenever you can have some time or when you have, even in the work places, if you're alone,

00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:59.000
 quiet, maybe three minutes, just relax and kind of meditate and look inwardly.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:06.700
 And just bring more joy and appreciation, compassion, and also some degree of what's called

00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:08.000
 comparing.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:13.270
 In the world, there are so many troubles and difficulties, but to compare with that, what I have is

00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:15.000
 not too big things.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:22.000
 So, I'm so thankful, so grateful. I will do good things to benefit to myself, to others.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:27.000
 May that happen by the blessings of the Buddhas and bodhisattvas.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:30.000
 So, those all are obviously.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.000
 Thank you, Rinpoche.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000
 Thank you, thank you.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.000
 Yes? Yeah?

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:41.000
 Sorry, I missed doing it.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:46.770
 Thank you, Rinpoche. I'm going to try to form this question because it's still a little bit of an

00:42:46.770 --> 00:42:48.000
 unformed thought.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:54.630
 But, we've been talking, you've been talking about Rigpa as non-duality mind. Our primordial

00:42:54.630 --> 00:43:02.000
 awareness is non-duality mind, which means there's no subject-object separation.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:12.890
 Even in the most settled periods of meditation, where thoughts come and go, there is still a sense

00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:14.000
 of an eye.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:24.000
 There is still a sense of a perceiver to what is.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:33.720
 Does that weaken with practice, or will it require becoming fully enlightened before that eye

00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:36.000
 really dissolves?

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:41.000
 I mean, it seems like it's dug in there so hard.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:46.000
 No, that will take some time.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:53.000
 But when you're able to relax in an edge like that way, it really is good.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:56.000
 I mean, that's a really good success.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:03.660
 But to go away completely, the thought of the eye, it really will take time. And that's what in the

00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:10.000
 Buddha teaching, you heard five parts, ten bhumis.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:18.400
 Bhumis, those are the stages of the realization and level you're discovering or you're pretty from

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:21.000
 the grasping attachments.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:30.650
 That will take time. But if we continue meditating like this, according to the Jogji teaching, then

00:44:30.650 --> 00:44:33.000
 we can get enlightenment.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:39.000
 And within these lifetimes, it still only takes time. It's not going to go immediately away.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:48.490
 Because this thought of the eye, or this eye is not just developed recently, according to the

00:44:48.490 --> 00:44:49.000
 Buddha teaching,

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:59.040
 it really came from a long time ago. A long time ago, it is very difficult to completely go where

00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:02.000
 immediately it will take.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:11.560
 But if we do continually this practice and meditate, then we can use all of this eye or this

00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:15.000
 thought of the eye to benefit others, to inspire them.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:22.360
 So, it's not something that is completely bad all the time. But if we handle that thinking of

00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:26.000
 subject and object, we can benefit others.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:34.380
 But at the same time, soften our ego and soften our eyes or attitude of eyes, and then discover

00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:37.000
 really the nature of it as it is.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:46.040
 So, it's nothing really too bad all the time. But if we kind of carry with that force, then it

00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:49.000
 becomes big disturbances.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:55.000
 Okay. Okay. Yes, yes.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:03.330
 I just had a question regarding cutting through attachment and aversion. If you had any advice as

00:46:03.330 --> 00:46:09.000
 to how to cut through attachment and aversion after one has been introduced to the view?

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:14.370
 After one has been introduced to the view? If you had any advice as to how to cut through

00:46:14.370 --> 00:46:16.000
 attachment and aversion?

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:22.710
 And that is, I mean, generally, all our practice in meditation really will help to cut the

00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:26.000
 attachment. Right? That's why it's stronger. Right? Attachment.

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:32.360
 I meant also in terms of, like, everyday, like, say, like, you know, likes, dislikes, the type of

00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:36.000
 aversion or attachment generated through all of this.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:45.450
 Yeah, but that, generally, the attachment, again, as the same way what Mary is discussing, that it

00:46:45.450 --> 00:46:50.000
's really difficult immediately to go, to cut that completely.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:59.490
 But the effort we have, every have the good, I mean, always trying to have good mindfulness, really

00:46:59.490 --> 00:47:01.000
 good mindfulness.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:09.100
 The moment we are having disturbance of the attachment, instead of always objecting that or the

00:47:09.100 --> 00:47:17.000
 following after that, and look to yourself or to that thought of the attachment.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:24.700
 And then, immediately, look to that thought. That moment when you look to that, your attachment

00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:29.000
 thought, you're really cutting your attachment.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:36.690
 That moment, you cut that immediately. So, what cut? It cut that, the continual flowing attachment,

00:47:36.690 --> 00:47:38.000
 you stop that.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:46.390
 And then, when you look to your mind, to look to your mind, where that attachment coming, there's

00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:49.000
 again the same thing as we've discussed many times.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:56.430
 There's nothing in existence. It is completely open, emptiness status. So, that is really the

00:47:56.430 --> 00:47:58.000
 cutting attachment.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:07.490
 But, for example, good and bad and a hope and a fear, all these things, during the day time, let as

00:48:07.490 --> 00:48:15.000
 much as we can bring that strength of the mindfulness and not holding too much of that.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:20.620
 With worry and with anxiety or whatever that, if you don't do that, that is your handling of the

00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:27.000
 attachments or those difficulties.

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:34.000
 So, that's what really we should, I mean, that's how we can reduce the attachment.

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:40.820
 And the cutting is, that's what I said, according to Zokki teaching, and that's a look to the

00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:49.000
 source of the attachment moment is raging, and that is, that means, that moment you cut it.

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:57.000
 That's it. You cut it without subject to the object. Yeah. Okay.

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:03.020
 And aversion, when you're speaking about attachment, aversion would be the same thing. Same thing.

00:49:03.020 --> 00:49:10.730
 All these emotions, anything, emotions, whatever that is, really, we look to cut that by the

00:49:10.730 --> 00:49:16.000
 practices that is looking to each of those emotions.

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:22.520
 And then, when you look, there's nothing substantial existing, and let it go. That's it. Let it go,

00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:28.660
 and then relax it, that stays for a few minutes or a few seconds, whatever you can do, that is

00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:31.000
 known as cutting that.

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:36.910
 But it didn't mean completely you uprooted that. I mean, that will take time, and that will take

00:49:36.910 --> 00:49:42.000
 time, do that again and again, and that is known as practicing. We are practicing.

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:57.000
 Yeah. Good. Okay. Anyone? Yeah. Wow, that's so good, then. Yeah. Yeah.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:05.240
 Rinpoche, thank you so much. Last week we talked just a little bit about pure relative truth. Is

00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:14.960
 pure relative truth then something like being in a state of non-returner, or can you have moments

00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:20.000
 of pure relative truth and then impure relative truth?

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:24.000
 Does it go back and forth, or once you're there, are you always there?

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:32.060
 No, it depends. I mean, it really depends. If you have the really good realization, then it is a

00:50:32.060 --> 00:50:34.000
 non-return status.

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:39.740
 Okay. But pure relative truth is what that actually means. I'm sure maybe I spoke that all the day,

00:50:39.740 --> 00:50:47.000
 and maybe you're in. But pure relative truth is what Buddha sees these objects.

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:55.400
 Oh, what? Like, Gurbama, Sambha, Seo, Buddha, Shakyamuni see everything, subject, object. That is

00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:56.000
 pure relative truth.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:02.630
 Or in other words, if I say that when you say pure land, when we're talking pure land, that pure

00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:09.000
 land, those individuals who are in pure land, what they see is pure relative truth.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:17.210
 Everything is pure relative. It is relative, but it's pure. It's relative truth is pure. So that's

00:51:17.210 --> 00:51:18.000
 it.

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:28.190
 For us to see that, again, it won't come immediately, but when we are good meditating, good medit

00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:35.000
ator, and good kind of experiences, then when you look to the world or when you think,

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:41.490
 it feels kind of quite good, good and nice. Even we have a difficult and hard times that, but when

00:51:41.490 --> 00:51:47.000
 you're really good meditator, it kind of feels good.

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:54.280
 And that is the beginning of the pure relative truth. Feels good, but okay, or I don't care. That

00:51:54.280 --> 00:52:01.000
 attitude, that attitude, all that is really beginning or the dawn of the pure relative truth.

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:03.000
 Thank you so much. Thank you.

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:09.000
 Now then, my question is, what is the difference between pure relative truth and absolute truth?

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:13.000
 Now I got confused, which I think is a good thing, to be a little confused.

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:18.130
 Okay, okay. Pure relative truth and absolute truth. Absolute truth, what we're talking, is the

00:52:18.130 --> 00:52:26.000
 Buddha teaching, same, really same, everywhere, is beyond the conception.

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:34.000
 That is the absolute truth. Pure relative truth is still you can play with conceptions.

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:42.670
 For example, those individuals in the pure land of the Buddha Amitabha, it didn't mean all of that

00:52:42.670 --> 00:52:45.000
 beyond the duality.

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:46.070
 There still are practitioners, many of that, according to you. For example, when we do the prayer

00:52:46.070 --> 00:52:56.500
 in the pure land of the Buddha Amitabha, I said, "May I be born in the pure land of the Buddha Amit

00:52:56.500 --> 00:52:57.000
abha?"

00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:05.490
 From there, I can achieve all the bhoomis in one after another in that. So that means they are

00:53:05.490 --> 00:53:07.000
 really, that is, they are still dualities.

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:14.080
 But because the power of the Buddha's blessings and your power, the inspirations, now you reach to

00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:15.000
 that stage.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:21.470
 So there is no more difficulty, troubles that become the hindrance of our practice or discover our

00:53:21.470 --> 00:53:23.000
 nature of the mind.

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:29.000
 But at the same time, there is so many supporters that inspire ourselves.

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:36.320
 We don't feel ladiness to practices or destruct that when continuing to grow that. So that is

00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:37.000
 really the pure.

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:44.000
 Then when you get completely in the enlightened state, then everything is become purity.

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:51.460
 And that is then, as I said, how Buddha sees. For example, what is Buddha seeing? He said, you know

00:53:51.460 --> 00:53:57.000
, pure, pure, pure, what's called this?

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:03.000
 What are we talking of? Pure states of the purity of the relative truth.

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:09.000
 Purity of the relative truth, what is it? The five elements, the five female Buddhas.

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:19.000
 Five aggregators are five male Buddhas. That is purity state of the relative truths.

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:27.000
 According to the purity, that level, the relational level, these are all existing.

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:31.000
 What we see is relative truths, but it is pure relative truths.

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:35.000
 So all is enlightened, not emotions, not negativity, not that.

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:42.410
 All really is a display of everything as five dhyana Buddhas or five female Buddhas, as well as

00:54:42.410 --> 00:54:43.000
 that.

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:48.640
 Or sometimes they say that everything is a display of the male and the female and the children of

00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:51.000
 the Buddhas, some of the Buddhas.

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:58.000
 Those are really the expressions of the pure relative truths.

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:09.020
 Thank you everyone. Thank you. We do one. Page 11, the short dedication of merit, just that one

00:55:09.020 --> 00:55:10.000
 page.

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:13.000
 Page 11. You remember?

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.000
 By this merit.

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:34.000
 Come on, little girl.

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:42.000
 Ooh. This is Gandhi. Sorry, sorry. Really. Thank you, little girl.

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:19.000
 Thank you. Thank you, everyone. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much, everyone.

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:28.000
 Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much, everyone. Thank you. I really have one recorset and a

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:28.000
 candle.

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:37.030
 This is one of the wishes. And that is, I like to make every cane. This, this, this spot, this spot

00:56:37.030 --> 00:56:41.000
 is like very nice and beautiful as a zen garden.

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:48.250
 Really like that. This one. So then when we open this, this curtains and also looks like kind of

00:56:48.250 --> 00:56:54.000
 extension of the room or the temple is kind of nice in this Buddha garden already.

00:56:54.000 --> 00:57:01.960
 So really, if anybody has some thoughts and how to make this. And I mean, it's already beautiful,

00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:04.000
 but still kind of a little bit added.

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:12.100
 Really, it's just maybe every way. I don't know, again, how that is. I may be making to learn to we

00:57:12.100 --> 00:57:20.000
 have quite what's called the waterfalls, small waterfalls, small waterfalls.

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:29.700
 Maybe really we can. Maybe if that happened, but if it's distracting mosquitoes, all those things,

00:57:29.700 --> 00:57:38.010
 then maybe, but, but otherwise, maybe really that is possible to put that spring, the waterfalls,

00:57:38.010 --> 00:57:40.000
 small ones and nice.

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:49.320
 And then how to make this kind of put this bubble, bubble stones, bubble stones or if not, not kind

00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:51.000
 of that needed.

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:59.000
 Then put the sands and maybe put this, what's called this slate, slate stones, slate stones.

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:05.990
 And then it was already believed as those planters exactly that, but just really we can make this.

00:58:05.990 --> 00:58:15.000
 Then it's just an extension of that because also since there's a pen that is so the people outside

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:18.000
 can see it won't become the distractions of those who are practicing here.

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:24.000
 here so then it's really nice so that's my idea so if there is any way that you

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:30.060
 can have kind of come up idea and a thought and to walk there as a song about

00:58:30.060 --> 00:58:38.640
 also I will come to you if you didn't we all kind of do that thank you thank you

00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:47.720
 thank you very much thank you thank you thank you really pure land like as nice

00:58:47.720 --> 00:58:54.680
 I always like the Zen garden but not a sand Zen garden but something is so

00:58:54.680 --> 00:59:02.040
 beautiful not so busy but also it's so nice they are very beautiful thank you

00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:09.040
 everyone thank you.
