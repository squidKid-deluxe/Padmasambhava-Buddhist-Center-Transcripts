00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.400
 Buddha is what? Actually, this is the very word "Sangye," translated "Buddha" into "Sangye."

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:19.760
 And "Sangye" has two meanings, meaning of the purification and meaning of the actualizations.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:28.960
 So, "San" means "purified." "Gye" means "actualized," and that combination is called "Sangye."

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.440
 That translated "Buddha" in the Tibetan language as "Sangye."

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:41.840
 The many great masters told me that the "Sangye" is more stronger than the Sanskrit word "Buddha"

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.960
 because it doesn't carry exactly the meaning of what really "Buddha" is.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.520
 "Buddha" is the word of the word, the language of the word of the "Sangye,"

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.560
 where it carries exactly what the "Buddha" is. Really, many told me.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:05.040
 So, in Sanskrit, the "Buddha" means what? What actually means kind of smart ones.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:12.530
 Smart, smart. And I understand also, in Russian languages, when you call someone "smart" or

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.800
 something,

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:21.920
 they call it "Buddhi." "Buddhi," something. I've heard it. "Buddhi," no? "Buddhi," no? "Buddhi?"

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:32.240
 "Awakened." Yeah. "Buddhi" means "awakened," right? Yeah, so. So. I heard that.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.000
 So this "Buddhi" is not currently carrying exactly what really "Buddha" is.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.640
 The Tibetan word really carries. If they were these great masters, these such great masters,

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.320
 that's what they called the emanated masters and dasmatas. Really, when they created these termin

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.800
ologies,

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.440
 they created them, and at the century, by the time of the "Kintuzong Devli," or encouragement of "K

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.520
intuzong Devli,"

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.680
 and "Granthuzong Devli," "San" and "Granthuzong" really meant so much. The marvelous, actually,

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:10.000
 that job, the marvelous, that some remarkable, that at that time, at the beginning of the time,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 the Tibetan language is just a language. There's nothing, terminology, all these things.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.320
 But that, they created this language. They made that with so many things,

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.520
 and created the world. World, and perfectly, beautifully, in the upper world,

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.280
 9th century, up to 9th century, 10th century. All those great translators, the Tibetan translators,

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:37.120
 so many came. They don't have to do any new things. All just follow with that language,

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:43.520
 what they created already. The world, you know, "Vakabolu" is. This is what, how really it is.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:50.400
 For that reason, these great translators, such as Verochara, Kava Partha, Jorulu, Jamsi,

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.760
 Hengi, Hidam, there's so many others, and great masters, Sheyata, Ratata, and Guru Pemma Sambhavai,

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:03.120
 and Kamala Shala, and Vamala Mathana, and then, as it is, when they also taught great masters in

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.960
 their time in Jana, Jana Mathra, Nana Shala, they go. Really, just, I can't believe, I mean,

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.040
 this short period of time, the complete astonishment.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:21.360
 The whole system of dynamic, complex city, language, you know, "Vakabolu" is. That case,

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:27.760
 the science of the mind, and the science of logics, and art, and beauty, all create,

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.840
 the completely sufficient language, the creative, and perfectly, totally meaningful. I mean, so,

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:41.520
 every angle you look, it has value, it has substation, the heaviness, weight, weight it has.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.560
 So, this Buddha, for example, like, Buddha have been talking, "Sang" means "purified".

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.570
 Also, "Sang" is also "purified" as in the Russian. Say it like that, "Wake up". "Sang" means "wake

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.720
".

00:03:52.720 --> 00:04:00.720
 "Wake". "Wake". "G" means "devil up". "Devil up". So, what that means "purified"?

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.320
 All the "wake up" means "wake up from the ignorance". All the two obscurations.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.760
 Or "purified" the two obscurations. And when you "purified" the two obscurations,

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:18.320
 one is "come up", then "devil up". Then the Muslims "devil up", "compassion" the full "devil up".

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:24.400
 "Vascular" the "compassion", or in the teaching, you say, "said", the "vascular" that "undersaid",

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:30.080
 exactly meaning of the Absolute Truth. "Vascular" that "undersaid", exactly meaning, or exactly as

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:36.080
 conventional levels, that two "Vasthas", completely different. "Vasthas" is not just a "Vasthas"

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.880
 wise one,

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:44.160
 "Vasthas" is completely combined, inseparable, with a great "compassion" that "devil up".

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.080
 That is what the Buddha is.
