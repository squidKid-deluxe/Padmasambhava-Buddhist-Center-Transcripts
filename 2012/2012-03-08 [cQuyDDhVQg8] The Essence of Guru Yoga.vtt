With devotion, we are spiritually settled, and growth will come. Guru Yoga brings together all of the buddhas, bodhisattvas, and great masters into Guru Padmasambhava, feeling a closeness, confidence, and trust in him as the source of all blessings and spiritual realization.",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200
 It is the accumulated memory, the accumulated memory, particularly the accumulated memory, which is

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.600
 led among the six paramatas,

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:17.840
 generous practices, disciplined practices, and passion practices, three paramatas, with joy forever

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:18.200
.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:25.520
 So it is all special practices, this is made out of it. Yes, and that is again, you go up to

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.800
 teaching this out, so it has all this.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:36.600
 And then purification, the purifications of the consecration, that is the Vaidya-sattva practices.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.310
 And that is again, purifying all obscurations, visualize the Vaidya-sattva, and this is again,

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:44.600
 special teaching of the Vaidya-yana.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:53.000
 Vaidya-yana started with this. And then, after that, then Guru Yoga practices.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.600
 And Guru Yoga practices is so special in the teachings. Of every teaching, teaching says Guru Yoga,

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.000
 it is so important,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.800
 because the essence of the Guru Yoga practice, again, is devotion and your confidence.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:14.600
 And the confidence in the lineage, in the teaching, and then this is the devotion.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:21.160
 And when you have the devotion, then we settle it. We settle it now. We are not going to wander in

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.400
 every different directions.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:30.010
 Spiritually, we settle it. When we are taking refuge in both each other, all that definitely

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.600
 settled.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:38.400
 When Guru Yoga is echoed, ourself, anchored down, we are no more gypsy of the spiritual, now.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:46.480
 How much is this? We settle, we plant it. And the similar, as when we settle, then we are brought

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.200
 to a calm.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:54.730
 And this is the other thing. For example, when we planted the seed, seed, and we started moving in

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.800
 every different directions,

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:05.590
 seed won't grow well. Even what's called home-siddling, home-siddling maybe, but still it won't

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.200
 bring the complete glory.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:16.600
 Therefore, Guru Yoga means, now you settle to that lineage that perhaps, from that on, really we

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.000
 begin to grow, begin to develop.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:27.840
 Therefore, devotion is important. Devotion is a combination of joy, appreciation, and written

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.800
 thought and confidence.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.000
 All that is devotion. Then we feel, but that's it. And we settle.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 Therefore, opening the teaching says, when you have the devotion, all everything will come. Come.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 That is, for example, at the beginning of this life, even we had the beautiful prayer that we were

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 able to translate it,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 or we organized this time. What's called stainless cane. Stainless cane.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:08.200
 And there's 14 roots, root, samayas of the Vedayana. At the very first, what I said, all

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:14.000
 realization achievements are followed with the teacher.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.670
 When you read it. And how that is all the realization, achievement, way accomplishment with follow

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.000
 with love of the teacher.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.940
 So therefore, I mean, seeing that, it's not just a teacher is important, but teacher is the source

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.000
 of all accomplishment.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 And therefore, also among the three root, what I said, the root of the blessing is lama.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:50.990
 Blessing means accomplishment, achievement, realization, and then I'm going to read the whole life

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.000
 story of those great masters.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.060
 When they are connected to the one teacher, the teachers and the lineage, the realization is a

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.000
 brute state.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:06.970
 In this, you can read the life story of all the masters of the Indian, the life story of all the

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.000
 great masters of Tibet.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 You read their realization, because then people can settle ourselves.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:23.420
 So, and therefore, it's so special. I mean, this is just a brilliant, but then with that, and here

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:24.000
 also.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:33.050
 So when we have this guru yoga practice, if we keep that heart, heart, and then it will quickly

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.000
 grow, realization will come.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.860
 Otherwise, then the realization will slow, and even God's realization, there's some kind of

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.000
 entrance to come.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 And so for that reason, the unfailing devotion is so important.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 And then, when this devotion comes, then it merges with true natures, a nature of all.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.670
 In this, for that reason, for example, always the teachings say, even we have hundreds of teachers

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:12.000
 who bring that all in one central status as Gaurapayama sambhava.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 Gaurapayama sambhava is our teacher, or our teacher sees in Gaurapayama sambhava status.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 So every teacher is merged in one central status, one central status as Gaurapayama sambhava.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 For the storm, the war, Gaurapayama sambhava.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 Then all meet, no matter how many teachers, the realization we met in one central state.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:48.590
 So Gaurapayama sambhava is the satellite desk, where every task meet, or everything all come in one

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:51.000
 central status.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 Then we practice Gaurapayama sambhava.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
 This is also in the teachings say. We didn't practice it that way.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 Then we practice all the lamas too.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.810
 And for example, if we like to connect with all the lamas, then it's difficult to go all the

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:07.000
 different ways.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 But then we practice Gaurapayama sambhava, then it merges everything.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:19.080
 It's similar, if it's difficult, for example, if we go to the hundred different valleys to drink

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.000
 the water, it's difficult.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 But if we drink that water away, all the merge in one place is all merged.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 If we drink, we drink all the waters.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:38.980
 Similarly, we knew every blessings, every realization, every kind as a conveyor, merge to that

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:41.000
 state of Gaurapayama sambhava.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 And then we feel that presence.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
 Then, then we practice Gaurapayama.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 So strong people, we talk as seeing Gaurapayama sambhava, then it's so special.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 Here, for those reasons here, they said all the realizations, they come.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 And it's just Gaurapayama. We merge our realization and the realization of Gaurapayama sambhava.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000
 Our heart and realization of Gaurapayama sambhava merge what the teachers merged and took at them.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:20.590
 And then, the realization which is beyond word, beyond concept of it, rises so beautifully,

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:26.000
 beautiful and so special.
