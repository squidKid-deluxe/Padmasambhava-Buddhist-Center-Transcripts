00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.560
 Thank you, everyone. Welcome. Thank you very much for coming and for participating. Again,

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:24.160
 we will continue to follow the teaching of the gracious or genderly gracious teacher of

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:30.920
 the Buddha Shatyamuni, and particularly, is highlighted by the Japji Duryubuji. We are

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:41.680
 going through these essential teachings, known as Heart Advise, to the 14th students or Heart

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:48.480
 Instruction for the 14th active practitioners. So, that is the title, and we are going on

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.800
 the subject of the continuing, and I will kind of lay out, or we started with the lay out

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:02.800
 and following the voice and the teaching of the great Master Moon Kiva, and so we divided

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:10.840
 these kind of three frames into teaching. All the practices, those are known as the three

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:17.360
 nobles, beginning noble as foundation, and middle noble, second noble as the prince of

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.760
 part of the practices, and then third noble is the conclusion of the practices. So, these

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:32.360
 three noble, we kind of combine our practices within this frame, then this teaching practices

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:39.760
 is completely goes perfectly, beautifully, in order to benefit all living beings in the

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:46.840
 same time, also actively and get enlightenment. So, this is the word of the great Master,

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:54.760
 really the master taught us, is very practical instruction. So, we put kind of follow with

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:01.160
 that instruction, and now is the beginning part. Beginning part, again, generally all

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:08.840
 the teachings, whether you are studying, contemplating, meditating, all the practices, I am just

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:09.120
 using

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:16.760
 the practice in meditating two words, because generally meditation is actually, it also

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:23.280
 encompasses all the practices, but generally meditation with jainting, meditation with

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.680
 silence, whether that is, so that's what I am doing, kind of practices in meditation,

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:37.080
 two different things, reality is same, and so that whatever we do, meditating activities,

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:44.560
 that is always good, have so important to have beautiful motivation, and those are always

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:51.320
 highlighted, and as well as all the teachings are mentioned, and which is, then joy and

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:58.400
 appreciation, and both each other, and then devotion, so really purely understanding or

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:05.120
 the realization of radiata teachings. So, those are generally, and particularly, also

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:12.840
 when we are talking about three novels, this three novels, that first is motivation, and

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:20.840
 we kiss, then I start discussing little bit of meaning of the devotion or the pain, and

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.920
 then I start talking about both each other, we have been talking about both each other,

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.840
 even it is taking little time to go through this, because I am going little bit, detail

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.980
 each of those meanings, so that we can touch to our heart, heart and observe the meaning

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:45.000
 to the heart. Both each other is, of course, we all know that is so important, it is a

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.960
 completion, it is a wisdom, but yet how to explore the meaning, the flavor of the teaching,

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:59.440
 so that we can put in the practices, that is my intention, going little bit, details

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:05.320
 of this eight point. And then also, how regularly this time, the situation, we are not completely

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:10.880
 kind of rushing to the things, because we are doing like kind of retreat, alone, with

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:16.880
 situation, circumstances, kind of like created, as I do in retreat, we are basically also

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.520
 all our way in our own places, sitting there, so we don't have to be limited by the one

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:28.120
 weeks, or five days, or three days, something is we are kind of in a home, we are really

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:34.200
 practicing, learning the technique of the modern, technique, we are really kind of developing

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:40.120
 our knowledge, understanding of some really, we are clarifying our memories of all the

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:46.120
 teachings, and all the books we read, so those are our reason, I am going little bit slowly,

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:53.120
 all those each points. And so now, we go again, we do both together, and now, I said, yes,

00:04:53.120 --> 00:05:00.120
 today, we explained, or we went through that video about the nature of the bodhicata, nature

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:07.120
 or identity of the bodhicata. And we made also the world meaning of the bodhicata, world

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:14.120
 meaning of bodhicata. These names are generally very important, because when you have this

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:21.120
 meaning of the world, it really tells the essence of the meaning, what is bodhicata

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:34.120
 is, that mind of enlightenment. That is very, very powerful, very, very targeted title, title,

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:44.120
 enlightened mind. Where is that enlightened mind? It's not outside. Each of us, that we

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:53.120
 all have this enlightened mind. But we have now recognized this jewel, this preciousness,

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:59.120
 recognized, and then have to activate it. That is what this bodhicata is.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:06.120
 Then with the meaning of that title, or the world meaning of the bodhicata, we learned

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:13.120
 nature or the identity of the bodhicata. Nature and identity of the bodhicata has two

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:20.120
 principle meanings. Compassion and the verstance, that combined. Or loving kindness,

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:29.120
 compassion, verstance. That is really the bodhicata. And which is also our mind, our

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:38.120
 nature of the mind. Love is our mind, compassion is our mind, verstance is our mind. That is

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:44.120
 the one that really bodes each other. Bodhicata. But this time, not just a love, not just

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:53.120
 a compassion, not just a verstance, we are expanding, expanding them, love and compassion.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:07:02.120
 To whom? To all the beings with six realms. That is the one, the beauty of the bodhicata.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:09.120
 Extending. Otherwise, everyone has love and compassion. If we put their own

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:15.120
 surviving purposes, or our own surviving purposes, we need love, we need compassion.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:22.120
 With our love and compassion, we won't survive. Survive. But this time, not just

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:28.120
 kind of talking about the surviving situations, but how to intensify, how to

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:38.120
 glorify, how to expand the bodhicata without any border. Love without border,

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:45.120
 compassion without border, and the wisdom that understands everything so perfectly

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:52.120
 clear, exactly as it is. That is the deal. That is really talking, we are talking.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:59.120
 It is true nature. Until now, our oldest love and compassion, wisdom, are completely

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:07.120
 limited. It is restricted. In a way, it is very narrow and kind of like old,

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:15.120
 as restricted everywhere is borders. But this time, we are breaking that border

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:28.120
 and extending the love and compassion beyond the borders. That is what the

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:37.120
 bodhicata is, nature of the bodhicata. Loving kindness and compassion is projected

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:43.120
 for all the living beings, and wisdom is projected to get enlightenment.

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:49.120
 And this true arcane target, that is really known as bodhicata.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:55.120
 And now that nature, that is the identity of the bodhicata, once we do that,

00:08:55.120 --> 00:09:02.120
 then bodhicata can be divided into sub-divisions. I go over that.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:08.120
 And we develop the bodhicata according to the willingness of the bodhicata I

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:16.120
 mentioned yesterday. Kings like bodhicata, shepherd like, cell like bodhicata,

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:23.120
 shepherd like bodhicata. Those are I mentioned. Those are the, according to how

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:28.120
 the willingness of the bodhicata, how they like to do, how they like to develop

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:34.120
 the bodhicata and benefit for all living beings. How, particularly, how to benefit

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:42.120
 for all the sentient beings. Kings like bodhicata, cell like bodhicata, and shepherd

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:50.120
 like bodhicata. So those are the three sub-divisions. Now again, the bodhicata

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:58.120
 is not just for short little time. The moment we enter the path of enlightenment,

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:07.120
 this bodhicata goes all the way to brotherhood, enlightenment. Therefore, according

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:15.120
 to the path in the booming, and we all heard five parts and ten boomers.

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:27.120
 And therefore, bodhicata is intensifying each part or each booming when we advance.

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:35.120
 And stronger, and stronger, and wider, wider, and stronger, and then it is really

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:43.120
 developing, bodhicata. Accordingly that way, and then bodhicata also divided

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:51.120
 whole kind of bodhicatas. And how that is? And the teachings said, first two parts.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:57.120
 Among the five parts that you all heard, and I'm sure you read all in the books

00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:05.120
 and everyone, that five parts, first is known as the accumulation part. Second is

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:13.120
 the application part. So that is the true part. That true part will connect to the

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:21.120
 first booming, first booming. And then, how many boomers? Boomi is a sense of how many

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:30.120
 levels, and where? How many levels? That is, there is ten boomers, or ten levels.

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:38.120
 Ten levels, everybody says, again, ten levels divided into two groups. And that is,

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:47.120
 first seven boomers. That is, first seven boomers. And then, how many now left?

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:54.120
 For two, maybe ten boomers. Only three booming, or three levels left. Those are

00:11:54.120 --> 00:12:01.120
 known as the last three boomers. So now, I'm again going back to, again, what I said.

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:08.120
 The first five parts, among the five parts is first two parts will connect to the

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:16.120
 first booming, which is, I already said, the accumulation part, application part.

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:25.120
 That time, the bodhicata is known as the arising of carrying on, carrying up bodhicata

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:35.120
 with the beautiful intentions or aspirations. So that is, that is what posts the

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:43.120
 stage of the bodhicata, with the beautiful aspirations, carrying or conducting the

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:54.120
 bodhicata with the beautiful aspirations. So that is the first and second part.

00:12:54.120 --> 00:13:01.120
 And the third now, third part, now as in, I call it part level, that you all know,

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:08.120
 is seeing part, but I call it booming. This is now the post-booming. Post-booming

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:16.120
 all the way to seven booming. Booming, that bodhicata is known as the, the

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:27.120
 superior, superior intention, carrying on the bodhicata with the superior intention.

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:32.120
 That is my translation, roughly. But of course, you can look in the different

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:39.120
 dictionaries, how they translate it, related to that. So that is, is the bodhicata

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:47.120
 from the first booming, ten, seven booming. Seven booming. And next, last three

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:54.120
 boomies, which is at the booming, nine booming, ten booming, that booming or

00:13:54.120 --> 00:14:04.120
 levels of the bodhicata is known as fully ripening bodhicata, fully maturing or

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:13.120
 fully wrapping bodhicata. That is the third state of the bodhicata.

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:19.120
 And then, the post-bodhicata is known as bodhicata, which is completely

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:28.120
 purified all the obscurations, all the obscurations. That bodhicata is with

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:36.120
 the Buddhas, the enlightenment, Buddhas. Now, I will go back again to those, their

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:48.120
 meanings. First one, this first part and the second part, why it is known as the

00:14:48.120 --> 00:15:02.120
 "alala" or "mupi-job seji" and carrying the bodhicata with beautiful intentions

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:09.120
 or aspirations, I translate it. In the debate, it is called "mupi-job seji."

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:15.120
 I mean, this is a very popular terminology in the Mahayana Buddhism. And as I said,

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:21.120
 "you can look on the dictionary, you can see the whole meanings." But what that

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:32.120
 means, the post-bodhicata, our realization is, particularly our realization of the

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:38.120
 emptiness is on the "tiru," "tiru," not really have the perfect

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:45.120
 realization. It's called "tiru." In the teachings said, "at the Akumarahe part,

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:52.120
 you know the meaning of the emptiness or the absolute truth, you understood that,

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:58.120
 you understood what that means." With courage and commitment and with inspiration,

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:03.120
 without doubt, you continually meditate in practice, then reach for the second

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:11.120
 part, and the Akumarahe part, and the Akumarahe part, the absolute truth,

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:16.120
 that individually experiences the absolute truth. Now the fourth, you understand,

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:22.120
 not now, that becomes more stronger, and then you understand the absolute truth

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:29.120
 with some different experiences. So therefore, this time, those bodhisattva who

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:37.120
 were the first and second, those in a part, they are still within emotions.

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:42.120
 But yet, they have a very beautiful motivation and strong courage and

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:47.120
 commitment, keeping up the aspiration of the bodhisattva, and therefore,

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:53.120
 it's known as the arising beautiful motivation of bodhisattvas.

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:59.120
 Now, when we continue to keep that practice, now what we reach? To the post booming,

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:06.120
 or according part level, we are in the seeing part. Seeing part,

00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:12.120
 you see the true nature, or that means emptiness, exactly as it is,

00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:19.120
 particularly egolessness. Egolessness is really we see, exactly as it is,

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:25.120
 not in theory, not just intellectual understanding, but exactly seeing that.

00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:31.120
 Particularly in the teachings, those bodhisattva meditating,

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:40.120
 on that meditation status, there is no egos, no egos at all, completely one agent.

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:47.120
 But in the post meditation status, there are still some kind of residues

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:55.120
 or the subtle emotions, and therefore, it's called seeing part.

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:59.120
 What you've been practicing at the application,

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:05.120
 accumulation part, application part, all that time, now truly we see.

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:09.120
 This is not just theory, it's not just presumption,

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:14.120
 now you begin to soar, exactly, face to face, through nature,

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:19.120
 all the emptiness, emptiness of the egos.

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:22.120
 And in some degree, all this phenomena exists,

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:29.120
 it's also the magic, dream, and mirages that you perceive, that realization.

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:36.120
 And therefore, it is known as a highly superior,

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:44.120
 superior intention, pure conduct of each other. That is then very good.

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:47.120
 And that goes all the way to the seventh woman,

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:51.120
 straight all the way to the seventh woman, until the seventh woman.

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:57.120
 Then, last, the third one is, I translate it as

00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:03.120
 fully revenue of the maturity, of maturity.

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:08.120
 What that means? Fully revenue of the aspiration of both each other.

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:13.120
 It is really revenue. So that means all the aspirations,

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:18.120
 all the prayers, all what we wish for the body activity

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:23.120
 to benefit all living beings, glorify our obscurations, obstacles,

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:30.120
 all now in the third, sorry, at the booming, in the ninth booming,

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:34.120
 and the tenth booming is actually happening.

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:43.120
 That ripening, maturing, wishes are coming through now, coming through.

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:50.120
 Therefore, it is known as bodhijata of the maturing, maturing bodhijata.

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:54.120
 And now, in the Buddha's hold, Buddha hold,

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:58.120
 when you reach the Buddha hold, then it is known as bodhijata

00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:02.120
 that glorify all obscurations.

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:08.120
 Now, no obscurations. Now, what kind of now bodhijata Buddha has?

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:14.120
 Buddha has the absolute bodhijata, absolute bodhijata.

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:19.120
 Relative to bodhijata is complete,

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:24.120
 but this absolute bodhijata is now fully developed.

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:28.120
 We don't need any obscurations.

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:35.120
 Therefore, it is known as fully developed or fully modified obscurations

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:39.120
 of bodhijata, dripping our senses in its ways.

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:47.120
 So those are divided according to the path and the booming level of the bodhijata.

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:52.120
 Then, bodhijata can be divided again or can be understand

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:56.120
 in a word called true truths.

00:20:56.120 --> 00:21:01.120
 How many truths? All the truths, according to Mahayana,

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:08.120
 can summarize into true truth, relative truth and absolute truth.

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:11.120
 So this is true truth.

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:16.120
 And therefore, the bodhijata can be divided into two truths.

00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:21.120
 That which is simple, relative truth, bodhijata,

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:24.120
 and absolute truth, bodhijata.

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:28.120
 That is, that's it, true bodhijata.

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:34.120
 And relative truth, bodhijata also can be divided now, more true,

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:38.120
 when particularly when we start practicing bodhijata,

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:42.120
 then its goal is true bodhijata.

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:45.120
 Those are known as, as you all know,

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:50.120
 wishing bodhijata and actualizing bodhijata.

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:54.120
 Mumbai safety and yoga safety in a debate.

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:57.120
 True bodhijata.

00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:05.120
 Wishing bodhijata and actualizing or engaging bodhijata.

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:09.120
 Those are true bodhijata.

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:12.120
 Now, how we do this?

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:15.120
 How we to carry on these bodhijata?

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:17.120
 Wishing bodhijata.

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:20.120
 Wishing bodhijata, generally, again,

00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:25.120
 you, as I said already, you should receive that blessing,

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:29.120
 lineage blessing, which is also known as vows.

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:32.120
 Those are, according to teaching,

00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:36.120
 you should get those from the qualified leader or teacher

00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:42.120
 who has that wishing bodhijata, lineage.

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:45.120
 If somehow very difficult to help the teacher,

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:50.120
 then you can take bodhijata vows in front of the shrines,

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:53.120
 where the stages, stages you can take.

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:57.120
 But do with offerings, do those ceremonies,

00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:00.120
 follow the lineage instructions and attack,

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:02.120
 attack the bodhijata vows,

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:05.120
 and then later, when you have the opportunity,

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:10.120
 you should also take, reactivate or attack again with the teacher

00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:13.120
 who has those bodhijata vows,

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:15.120
 and do that as they are called and stop.

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:18.120
 So once we talk about bodhijata vows,

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:20.120
 now we are going to practice.

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:25.120
 We need to practice as I said, then true bodhijata.

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:30.120
 Wishing bodhijata and actualizing bodhijata.

00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:33.120
 Wishing bodhijata is our intention.

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:38.120
 Intention, I like to benefit all living beings.

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:42.120
 Really thinking strongly and see with the comparison,

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:47.120
 see all the sentient beings, all the living beings going through.

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:52.120
 So many difficulties, heart and troubles, ups and don'ts.

00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:53.120
 It's just really going.

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:58.120
 Even their intention, again, interesting to be happy, peaceful.

00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:02.120
 You are yet they are not fulfilling all that.

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:06.120
 At the same time, not just fulfilling the same time,

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:10.120
 but also by the unknowing situation,

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:13.120
 they are creating more difficult troubles

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:19.120
 that will bounce back with very strong challenges.

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:23.120
 Their own creations, by their own mistakes.

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:26.120
 And a simple way to tell our own mistakes,

00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:30.120
 we create so much trouble to our own self.

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:34.120
 So thinking is good or something kind of like some solution,

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:36.120
 some relief, whatever.

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:40.120
 Because gain and resonate to be happy, peace and joy.

00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:44.120
 And then kind of like unskillfully, unknowingly,

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:50.120
 we create more cause and condition to be more trouble

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:52.120
 and more kind of challenges.

00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:56.120
 Ongoing burdens created by one's own self.

00:24:56.120 --> 00:25:02.120
 That is going on and on, on and on, endless, endless.

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:05.120
 That wasn't extolled by the gracious teacher Bodhachaktamali,

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:08.120
 because seeing exactly as it is.

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:11.120
 And then in something, we know our self too,

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:13.120
 how we go through in this samsara.

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:16.120
 Time, we have the memories until now.

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:19.120
 When we look back to our life stories,

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:24.120
 we can look back to our self, how much things we don't.

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:27.120
 Thinking is good at that time.

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:33.120
 And it ended up being kind of endless, chaotic, and it troubles one another.

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:36.120
 And that we do all the time.

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:38.120
 Everyone is enjoying that.

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:41.120
 Therefore, then by the compassion,

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:48.120
 so really like to help all the sentient beings to fulfill their final interest,

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:54.120
 final wish, have happy and peace, joy and fulfillment,

00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:59.120
 peace and harmonious, really wish that strongly.

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:04.120
 I like to help and with that intention, that with that thought strongly,

00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:07.120
 and then I'm going to do the how to act.

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:09.120
 How we can help to all the beings,

00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:13.120
 because I need more skills and more wisdom and understand.

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:17.120
 Therefore, I'm going to practice, meditate, think of that.

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:21.120
 So that is known as wishing Bodhachaktamali.

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:24.120
 Now how we carry on the wishing Bodhicata.

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:28.120
 According to it, to summarize, again to simplify,

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:36.120
 wishing Bodhicata carried by the poor, boneless, that we all know, poor, boneless.

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:46.120
 Boneless love, boneless compassion, boneless joy or the rejoice, and boneless economy.

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:53.120
 With that, then Tungmin practice, which is quite popular in the West, Tungmin.

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:55.120
 And that is what it's called.

00:26:55.120 --> 00:27:00.120
 First is equalizing myself and others, one.

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:08.120
 The second is Tungmin, which is giving our joy and peace to the others

00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:15.120
 and taking their suffering, mentally to ourselves, and that is Tungmin.

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:22.120
 And third is others are more important than ourselves, or one's own self.

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:27.120
 So those three are the four boneless.

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:33.120
 Best upon the four boneless, then this equalizing Bodhicata practices

00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:39.120
 and Tungmin practice Bodhicata, and the others are more precious and important

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:42.120
 than one's own self, the practice of Bodhicata.

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:47.120
 Those are all known as these seven different things.

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:52.120
 All the numbers put seven, poor, boneless, three, those.

00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:59.120
 Three is equalizing and exchanging, Tungmin exchanging,

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:03.120
 and others are more important than myself.

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:06.120
 Those three makes, I think, seven.

00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:13.120
 Those are known as the training of the Wishing Bodhicata in the mental.

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:17.120
 Those are known as Wishing, that mentally developed that.

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:20.120
 So this is Wishing Bodhicata.

00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:26.120
 Now, this Wishing Bodhicata, great masters, in practice of lineage,

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:31.120
 those great masters, such as Paparumuja, all those they mentioned,

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:37.120
 and as well as all those ancient Kada masters, such as Jogwa Jehi,

00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:42.120
 and his disciples and disciples, they all completely saturated their heart,

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:45.120
 their mind, and contact with Bodhicata, really.

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:48.120
 Truly marvelous, beautiful.

00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:52.120
 Just their practice, their principle practice was Bodhicata.

00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:55.120
 And in their teachings, what in the teachings said,

00:28:55.120 --> 00:29:03.120
 that all this Bodhicata is a bit simplified, it comes down to the compassion.

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:07.120
 Love and compassion, that is really Bodhicata.

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:13.120
 Love and compassion for all living beings, our kindness and compassion.

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:16.120
 And we bring down that again to summarize more symbolically,

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:20.120
 then it's compassion, it comes to the compassion.

00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:24.120
 Compassion for all living beings.

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:29.120
 If that meant to elect a simple kind of voice in a common language,

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:32.120
 good heart, good heart.

00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:36.120
 That is what is really the Bodhicata.

00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:44.120
 Good heart, genuine good heart for all living beings without any discriminations.

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:46.120
 This is what also in the teachings said.

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:48.120
 For example, great master, Atisha,

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:56.120
 he always emphasized encouraging to be good heart.

00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:59.120
 When he met students, he would say,

00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:03.120
 "Did he have good heart? Good heart."

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:06.120
 And when he gave the instructions, he said,

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:11.120
 "Peek good heart. To be good heart. Good heart."

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:14.120
 In the teachings said, or in the life story said,

00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:20.120
 at one time Atisha got some uncomfortable, his hand or pen.

00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:23.120
 He got pen on his hand.

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:32.120
 He put his arm on the left, left arm for his disciple, Dronkomba.

00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:37.120
 Dronkomba. So he put his arm on the left of the Dronkomba.

00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:43.120
 He said, "Please bless to my arm because you have good heart."

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:46.120
 You have good heart.

00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:51.120
 That's giving blessings. If you want blessings, it's good heart.

00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:53.120
 That's really.

00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:58.120
 Atisha said to his disciple,

00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:03.120
 "Bliss my arm because you have good heart."

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:05.120
 That is what it is.

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:09.120
 The Bodhicata means good heart.

00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:12.120
 But good heart is not limited.

00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:15.120
 Good heart for all living beings.

00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:18.120
 That is really the bodhicata.

00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:22.120
 So therefore, kind of like to be practical of the practitioners,

00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:25.120
 of the Mahayana and Vayayana practitioners,

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:30.120
 always trying to bring up attitude of the good heart,

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:36.120
 love and kindness, compassion to all the living beings.

00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:42.120
 Soft and gentle, respectful. Dronk to the earth.

00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:44.120
 Humble and simple.

00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:47.120
 Those are according to the teaching,

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:52.120
 the treasure and ornament and beauty of the practitioners.

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:58.120
 Humble, simple, respectful and polite, kind.

00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:04.120
 And when you look to the others, also look with the eye of the kind eyes.

00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:08.120
 With love, what great teacher Bodhicata came and said,

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:13.120
 "Spoke with love, look to the others with love."

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:17.120
 He said with love, loving kindness.

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:20.120
 Those are really so powerful teaching.

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:25.120
 Simple, common, basic, but yet so powerful.

00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:29.120
 When we have this loving kind and the compassion, good heart,

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:34.120
 that is also perfect mindfulness.

00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:36.120
 It is mindfulness.

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:40.120
 When you have that attitude and thought in the heart and mind,

00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:45.120
 mind, every, our muscles, our nerves and stress,

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:53.120
 and our body feels calm, peaceful, relaxed.

00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:59.120
 See, it is so, it completely can't be like another dimension of the levels

00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:01.120
 of the physical systems.

00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:04.120
 When we have the loving kind and the compassion, or good heart,

00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:10.120
 then in a normal time, all those willingness, stress fall in, worries and anxiety,

00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:13.120
 all that heart and love and kindness and compassion,

00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:16.120
 on the other hand, just simple, relaxing kind.

00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:24.120
 Definitely that even for two minutes or one minute, it really makes difference.

00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:25.120
 We can feel that.

00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:28.120
 I mean, not just talking, you can feel that.

00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:32.120
 It's not just a Buddha said and a teaching said, it's true.

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:33.120
 We talk to ourselves.

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:36.120
 It's not just talking some story behind the mountains,

00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:39.120
 the other side of the planet is told.

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:44.120
 It's true, nugget, evidence, right up ourself is true.

00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:48.120
 So that is what really the wishing bodhicitta.

00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:53.120
 And again, to go through this wishing bodhicitta, then poor boneless.

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:57.120
 I'm going to talk those poor boneless, slowly by slowly,

00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:02.120
 and one after another as turned one minute, and we go over there,

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:06.120
 and even we didn't complete it, although just during this retreat,

00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:13.120
 we grab the perfect bite of the teachings, of the essential teachings.

00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:16.120
 Like teachings of the greatest teacher, Buddha Herkamuni,

00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:22.120
 is the big apple bites, apple bites of the blueberry bites, really truly.

00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:25.120
 Wherever you eat, it makes play.

00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:27.120
 It makes perfect.

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:30.120
 It makes full, full satisfaction.

00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:35.120
 It is because it's touching to our heart, our neck, our beauty.

00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:39.120
 As I said, we are not talking the story behind the planet,

00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:43.120
 or the Mars, or the Jupiter, or those, the Saturns.

00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:48.120
 We are talking of our own treasures, going through one apple and the other.

00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:54.120
 How to revere, how to beautify ourself, to be beautiful for all the beings.

00:34:54.120 --> 00:35:02.120
 Again, without the earth, calm, peaceful, respect, be practical, be the common sense.

00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:04.120
 That is the meaning of the truth.

00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:09.120
 The truth of the power of the practice. Buddha Herkamuni, Gurga Maasambhava.

00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:11.120
 So that's it.

00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:16.120
 Then, Paul Boneless, again, I've listed, you all know Paul Boneless.

00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:25.120
 Boneless law, boneless compassion, boneless joy, ordinary joys, boneless equanimity.

00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:28.120
 Those are known as Paul Boneless.

00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:30.120
 We are all here.

00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:37.120
 And how that prayer goes, and as we join, every time, with Buddha's heaven, that is,

00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:42.120
 may all living beings have happiness, cause of happiness.

00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:46.120
 That is loving kindness, boneless love, prayers.

00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:52.120
 And when we join that, reflecting our mind with that meaning, meaning.

00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:57.120
 This is very powerful meditation, powerful mindfulness practices.

00:35:57.120 --> 00:36:01.120
 Really, not from life, actually, really thinking that.

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:05.120
 May all living beings have happiness.

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:07.120
 And then not just that, only happiness.

00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:12.120
 To stay permanent is happiness, you have to have cause and conditions.

00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:14.120
 Everything is cause and conditions.

00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:18.120
 Nothing is developing without cause and conditions.

00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:21.120
 Therefore, to create the perfect, beautiful situation

00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:27.120
 and circumstance of cause and condition, then happiness lasts forever.

00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:32.120
 Therefore, we are reaching in short-term and long-term.

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:34.120
 Short-time, they have the happiness.

00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:39.120
 Long-term, they have the cause and condition to bring happiness.

00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:41.120
 All the living beings.

00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:43.120
 So that means what in the teaching said.

00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:49.120
 Today, we are reaching, breathing for the resolve and cause.

00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:52.120
 Result, good cause.

00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:57.120
 Cause and conditions result in happiness.

00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:02.120
 And so wishing that, really stay forever, long time.

00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:04.120
 Slowly we have time.

00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:09.120
 Join, may all living beings have, really wish that.

00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:16.120
 Strongly in heart, sitting from the heart, may all living beings have happiness.

00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:20.120
 And cause of happiness.

00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:24.120
 That is the lowing kindness, boneless love.

00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:27.120
 Then the next one is compassion.

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:35.120
 May all living beings have, free from suffering and cause of suffering.

00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:39.120
 All living beings are free from suffering.

00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:43.120
 What they are going through right now, ups and don'ts,

00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:46.120
 in the Buddha teaching, I mean not just teaching, it's true.

00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:53.120
 Getting old, sicknesses, and deep breasts, and old hair.

00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:55.120
 And then also dying.

00:37:55.120 --> 00:38:00.120
 And then the important Buddhism that also going to birth is the big process.

00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:02.120
 There are so many challenges.

00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:05.120
 They are going right now, all this.

00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:09.120
 So that means reaching our kind of, at least we are putting intention,

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:11.120
 as reaching both each other.

00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:16.120
 May all living beings are free from suffering.

00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:18.120
 But not just only suffering.

00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:21.120
 The cause of suffering.

00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:24.120
 Cause of that very suffering.

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:26.120
 And the condition of that suffering.

00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:32.120
 That cause and the condition not just came by itself without cause and condition.

00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:36.120
 It has cause, it has condition.

00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:42.120
 That producing of that old situation or that troubles.

00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:47.120
 Therefore sincerely, again from the sitting heart of the both each other,

00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:55.120
 or good heart, really wishing may all living beings free from suffering.

00:38:55.120 --> 00:39:01.120
 Whatever they are going through, whatever kind of suffering they are going through.

00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:06.120
 Through everyone, free from the suffering.

00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:09.120
 And cause of suffering.

00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:12.120
 Wishing that with good heart.

00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:17.120
 Think of this, so powerful, so genuine.

00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:19.120
 So good heart.

00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:22.120
 Every used common word, language.

00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:26.120
 It is simple, practical.

00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:31.120
 Really wishing sincerely from and what it does also according to it,

00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:37.120
 is knocking down our ego cleanse and purifying our obscurations.

00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:39.120
 Ourself.

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:43.120
 It is the very truest practices.

00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:48.120
 We building up so much energy of the good vitality of the positive

00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:54.120
 in all our system, the bodies, in all our chakras, all channels,

00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:58.120
 all our blood systems, every muscle.

00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:01.120
 And it is so powerful, so purificated.

00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:05.120
 It is big purifiers and big healers.

00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:08.120
 There is so many beautiful stories.

00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:13.120
 How those competing in the loving kind heal the suffering troubles

00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:16.120
 and purify the obscurations.

00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:18.120
 One after another.

00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:22.120
 So this is what we need, those both each other.

00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:26.120
 So wishing both each other is again, as I said,

00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:29.120
 when we practice wishing both each other,

00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:33.120
 wishing means, of course, is in the heart and the mind.

00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:36.120
 So how we activate, how we do exercise of that?

00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:38.120
 We do poor boneless.

00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:40.120
 Poor boneless.

00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:45.120
 And then once that kind gets strong, then equalizing

00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:50.120
 and turning, exchanging, and then others are even more

00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:54.120
 profusely important than once on the self.

00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:59.120
 Those are known as exercising of the opportune action

00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:02.120
 of the wishing both each other.

00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:05.120
 And that is the heart practice of foundation,

00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:09.120
 the heart practice of the bodhisattvas.

00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:12.120
 And that is my brief talk for today about bodhisattva,

00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:15.120
 and still I'm going to go.

00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:18.120
 Let me go on this tomorrow and so on.

00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:22.120
 And so thank you very much, everyone, for participating.

00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:24.120
 And again, thank you.

00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:25.120
 Thank you, everyone.

00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:27.120
 And then see you tomorrow, too.

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:28.120
 Thank you.

00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:29.120
 Thank you.

00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:30.120
 Thank you.

00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:32.120
 Thank you.

00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:36.120
 And now we do, again, our short meditation.

00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:44.120
 Thank you.
