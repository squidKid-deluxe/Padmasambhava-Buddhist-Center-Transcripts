00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.900
 Thank you very much, everyone, for your participation, and thank you again for welcoming everyone.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:19.240
 And again, today I'm going to talk a little bit about the pure land of Amitabha, or Dewacheen,

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:25.600
 and Amitabha. This is, I think, very important, really, for all us practitioners to be connected

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:32.080
 with Amitabha most strongly, even though we are really practicing very beautiful Vaijayana

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.760
 teachings and so many beautiful other things. But according to the greatest teacher of Buddha

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:46.040
 Shakyamuni, to connecting to Amitabha is so special, so important, and so beneficial to

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:55.370
 prepare all our obligations and the commitment of the both each other. It is really so, so powerful

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:56.160
 and so special.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.400
 So that's what I live with, I talk as much as according to my capabilities, some degree

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:09.720
 to reactivate your connection, all our connection, to the Amitabha this time. That is what. But

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.520
 in order to begin this, again, we correct all our beautiful motivations, and that is

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:21.320
 the foundation of entirely Buddha teachings. Whenever we're studying, contemplating, practice

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:29.030
 or meditating is so crucial, not just so crucial, but if we like to really make this Dharma

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.560
 practice,

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:38.440
 Dharma teaching, observe it so perfectly, the correct motivation is the point. That is the key.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:44.520
 With all the correct motivation, even we are receiving the teachings, listening to the teachings

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.400
 or practicing Dharma or something, it's kind of going in different directions. Therefore, to

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:56.200
 absorb the teaching and practice it into the heart and bring the seedling call of the

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:04.840
 realization and fulfillment, it is correct motivation. And that is, again, just a symbol

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.920
 that we mentioned so many times, and you all know, present teaching from many great masters,

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:19.080
 and it is joy and appreciation. Joy and appreciation to our situation,

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:26.760
 circumstances, not kind of ignoring and put that in kind of a naive state. It's really

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:33.480
 highlighting, precious life, precious opportunity, precious teaching. Its abundance was precious

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.440
 the way we are surrounded. And the power of our conditions are also something really we have.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:46.760
 Very good, because we are eating freedom or lack of coke. Call it this. Call it this. So,

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:53.400
 therefore, for joy and appreciation. And together with the bodhicata, the bodhicata,

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:59.880
 what is the motivation of the bodhicata, thinking of all living beings. As a great teacher,

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:08.760
 Buddha Shakyamuni, all the lineage masters said as one voice, bodhicata is the practices.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:15.080
 Bodhicata is the foundation. Bodhicata is the achievement of the enlightenment.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:24.760
 This is really the foundation. Our foundation of bodhicata, our path is bodhicata. Our goal,

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:31.080
 when we become the Buddha or activate our realization, we discover the completely bodhicata.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:40.890
 So, therefore, why we don't touch to the basic, so important goodness, our own spiritual, the dh

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:41.160
arma

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:48.760
 junims, according to Mahayana teachings. So, bodhicata is so important. Then, we can add more,

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:56.040
 one more. Again, this, the Mahayana teachings we connected, the entire universe is also really pure

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:04.200
 land. As pure land was Amitabha, Deva Ching, Chikam, conducting those thought, is all known as

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:12.600
 motivations. With those motivations, now we go to the Amitabha teachings. Generally, great teacher,

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:19.000
 Bodhicaktamuni gave teachings. When he reached the enlightenment or become the Buddha, age 35,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:26.280
 until age 81, or 80, 80, 81, it's a different master's scholars to explain it different ways,

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:35.400
 but whatever way around 80, in terms of Mahaparin, until that, over 45 years, I think, he gave the

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:42.760
 teachings. The teachings that deals to remove our obscurations, obstacles, bring joy and peace,

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:50.280
 happiness, and as well as Arhata-hood, bodhisattva-yana status, or enlightenment status, he gave a

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.840
 variety

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:59.400
 of teachings. A variety of teachings, teachings, and those old teachings. Among these Amitabha

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:06.600
 practices is really one of the very, very powerful practices, powerful, and also according to the

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:17.000
 teaching is a very, very commonness and easy to practice. Practice has a big result, big results.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.640
 Generally, Amitabha teaching, Bodhicaktamuni, so in the teachings of all the Mahayans,

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:29.960
 Sotramahayana teachings, and as well as Vayayana teachings, but particularly this time, we are

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:37.080
 following is Sotramahayana teachings, Amitabha Buddha gave many teachings on Amitabha teachings,

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:46.120
 and a very famous one Amitabha Sutras, known as Amitabha, Sotra, or Dechi, or Bhamitim,

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:52.680
 those Sotra of the Amitabha, and the Sotra of the display of the Amitabha,

00:05:52.680 --> 00:06:00.360
 of the pure hands, and also known as the drum of the immortals, those are very high light

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:10.360
 teachings of the Amitabhas, and then as well as Lord Sotra, those all explaining about Amitabha,

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:17.590
 or Buddha giving extensively teachings on Amitabha. So this Amitabha, what it said, what Buddha

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:17.800
 said,

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:25.720
 Amit for example, to get enlightenment according to Mahayana Sotras, the highest

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:34.600
 accountability practitioners can reach enlightenment three countless eons, three countless eons,

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:41.400
 three countless eons is not short, it's a long time to really take these journeys,

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:51.320
 but Amitabha Sotra, every practices, it's the quickest one, fast ones, really you can

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:57.960
 get rebirth in the pure of the Amitabha, there in the pure of Amitabha you can

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:07.160
 accumulating and advancing all the boobies, and all the parts, parts, and for all the obligations

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:13.640
 of both each other, and reach enlightenment. So therefore, according to many teachings,

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:20.080
 many great masters, you say Amitabha is according to Sotra is the quickest way to reach

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:20.840
 enlightenment,

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:27.400
 and make meaningful and performant without any obstacles, that's really what it says.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:35.640
 In other words, in Sotra, even the fastest one to reach enlightenment is three countless eons,

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:42.040
 that is what Amitabha practices, every practice that with according instructions,

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:48.200
 then really according to teaching, then you take the rebirth in the, or we take the rebirth in the

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:59.200
 pure of the Amitabha, and there we can advancing, developing, progressing all our part in the boob

00:07:59.200 --> 00:07:59.480
ies,

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:07.400
 five parts, and ten boobies, we can perform that. So that is really the Amitabhas, how powerful.

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:13.320
 And now, in order to, this is again, who is the Amitabha actually, a ritual Amitabha,

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:21.800
 and this is, Amitabha is enlightenment, total beings. In the Amitabha, there is Sotra,

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:30.280
 Buddha, Ananda asked Buddha Shakyamuni, this Amitabha, Buddha explained all the beautiful,

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:36.920
 call it the benefits and powers and beauties of the Amitabhas, Pure Land in Amitabha,

00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:44.040
 so Ananda asked, this Buddha is kind of, is gone in the past time, or is it going to come in the

00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:51.480
 future, or is he now, right now here? And Buddha said, it's not the past Buddha, it's not the

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:57.960
 future of Buddha, it is the Buddha of right time, like this moment. So he's really living in Buddha

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:57.960
.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:06.840
 So that this Buddha, so this Buddha Amitabha is, has, why Amitabha? In Sanskrit, Amitabha,

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:15.480
 in the English translated, infinite light. Because the light of the love and the comparison,

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:22.680
 most of them has no measurement. It's just an infinite, really measurement. Therefore,

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:32.760
 it's called Amitabha or boneless of light, light. That light is love, compassion, and Muslims,

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:41.880
 that. And then Buddha Amitabha don't have any limitation and boundaries of their lives,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:49.800
 lives. There's no boundaries of lives, all measured by the numbers. And therefore,

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:59.720
 is known as Buddha Amitayu. That means boneless lives, long life. There's no even numbers can put

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:10.120
 by the Buddha. And then the glorious inability of the Buddha Amitabha or Amitayu is so pervasive,

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:20.520
 inconceivable. For that reason, also is known as Buddha Xintai in Tibet, the boneless of the

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:28.840
 glories, boneless of glories. So that is really Buddha Amitabha. And then also because of light,

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:36.200
 that, that light is infinite light. Therefore, there is also always the brightness, clear,

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:44.600
 clear clarity, or the vision, or the pervasive is also boneless. Therefore, also it's not

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:51.400
 instability. Now I'm tired. Now I'm tired means no boundaries of the, of the light or the,

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:59.320
 of the appearance or the visions is just a pervasive. So that is really the Buddha Amitabha.

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:09.000
 How Buddha Amitabha achieved these realizations? In the Buddha teaching set, long time ago, many,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.120
 long, long, many eons, many eons, hundreds of told that are countless eons before,

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:33.560
 there is the Buddha known as Jyukti Wamso, Jyarpo, J-I-G-T-E-N, Wamso, W-A-N-G-C-H-U-G,

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:44.760
 and then next one is J, J-S George, so G-Y-A-L-P-O, Jyukti Wamso, Jyarpo. That is the Buddha name

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:52.760
 of Jyukti Wamso Jyarpo. That time, who is the attendance of the Buddha Jyukti Wamso Jyarpo,

00:11:52.760 --> 00:12:12.620
 known as Hmong-Named, Hmong-M-O-N-K. Hmong-Named, Geelong Choo-Jee-M-Yoo-Nay, C-H-O-C-H-I Choo-Jee-

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:14.760
M-Yoo-Nay, J-S-J-G-U-N-D-E-Y,

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:22.120
 Geelong Choo-Jee-M-Yoo-Nay. Geelong Choo-Jee-M-Yoo-Nay. Attendance, that's the Geelong Choo-Jee-M-Y

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:22.520
oo-Nay.

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:29.030
 How is this Geelong Choo-Jee-M-Yoo-Nay, how he was Choo-Jee-M-Yoo-Nay? This is Hmong Choo-Jee-M-Yoo

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:29.320
-Nay.

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:36.760
 In the teaching said, Amitabha Satterb said, "Hmong Choo-Jee-M-Yoo-Nay has vastness of mindfulness,

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:50.600
 vastness of the wisdom, vastness of the compassion, vastness of courage, vastness of joyful effort,

00:12:52.120 --> 00:13:04.120
 vastness of the vision, projection of vision, goal, goal. This Geelong Choo-Jee-M-Yoo-Nay met

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:12.400
 and took the bodhicata vows from this Buddha, Jikti, Hmong Choo-Jee-M-Yoo-Nay, and then he made

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:13.000
 commitment.

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:26.920
 Whenever I get enlightenment, I like to have my pure land. It's the whole one hundred eighty-one

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:35.800
 thousand, one, not one hundred, one billion, one billion and eighty-one thousand pure lands.

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:43.640
 All the qualities are completely combined in one single pure land. That is what I really want,

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:50.280
 like to reach enlightenment. And I mean, Buddha Amitabha met so many commitments

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:57.800
 and one was also commitment, "Whoever hears my name and pray and with good heart and good thought,

00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:05.800
 pray that may they bone immediately regardless what situation they are facing in samsara.

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:13.880
 Immediately they bone, may they bone, they bone in my pure land." So forth, he really met one

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:20.920
 after another so many bodhicata commitments. And with that courage and their commitment, that

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:21.320
 vision,

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:28.170
 Geelong Choo-Jee-M-Yoo-Nay, the one upon a time is known as Amitabha, I mean came as like Geelong

00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:29.400
 Choo-Jee-M-Yoo-Nay.

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:37.000
 He accumulated all the merit and fulfilled all that commitment. And then in the teaching he said,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:43.880
 later after that when he reached at Bumi Bodhisattva, Geelong Choo-Jee-M-Yoo-Nay, when he reached

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:54.680
 at Bumi Bodhisattva at that time and Amitabha was born as a universal king known as

00:14:54.680 --> 00:15:01.880
 Yarpo Saptimushu, a universal king. And he has the minister known as

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:14.840
 and this minister has the young, he has son who become the Buddha, who becomes the Buddha

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:21.000
 and Rinchin Nyong-Pong and his name was Rinchin Nyong-Pong and he become the Rinchin Nyong-Pong

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:29.720
 and this, his minister, Tramsay Jam-Choo-Dol, asked to his king, the universal king,

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:36.520
 Geelong Choo-Jee-M-Yoo-Nay, you must make strong one again, once again strong commitment to reach

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:42.840
 enlightenment, become the Buddha and you're all aspiration of the Bodhisattva, you should make,

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:49.480
 you should make that. As he encouraged in the Geelong Choo-Jee-M-Yoo-Nay, the universal king

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:55.960
 made strong commitment and the current commitment, that moment, this Buddha,

00:15:55.960 --> 00:16:04.360
 Rinchin Nyong-Pong, he told, pronounced in the group, whole audience said, oh you came,

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:11.320
 come here, look to the western direction, there is a beautiful universe known as

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:19.960
 please, please, to holding or please behold, sorry, please, pleasing to behold, in the future,

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:26.920
 that universe will become a pure land of this blessfulness and that will be your pure land,

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:34.040
 this will be your future pure land. As he really announced that and again,

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:39.160
 Buddha Amitabha, who is going to become Buddha Amitabha, now still is a Bodhisattva,

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:44.920
 he accommodated so many marriages, so many marriages, so many aspirations,

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:53.250
 so many Madhijita commitments and all that, once he all preferred, now he become the Buddha Amitab

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:53.400
ha.

00:16:53.400 --> 00:17:00.280
 So he is residing Buddha Amitabha in western directions. According to the great teacher,

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:11.160
 Buddha Hakemuni, when Buddha Amitabha reached enlightenment, ten eons before our disproportionate

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:21.480
 eons, ten eons before, ten eons before our disproportionate eons of this world,

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:34.280
 this fortunate eons has one thousand Buddha to come, but before this ten eons, ten eons before

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:44.840
 our this eon, our this universe, our world where we are now, ten eons before this Buddha,

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:53.160
 Buddha Amitabha reached the enlightenment in the pure land of the Skavati in Amitabha, so

00:17:53.160 --> 00:18:01.720
 Buddha Amitabha is living Buddha. And according to the teaching, what the duration of the Buddha

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:08.520
 Pure Land Amitabha, how the measurement of the times, again in the Buddha Hakemuni's teachings,

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:17.080
 this one fortunate eon, this our eon from the time of the first Buddha to come in,

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:23.240
 time of the hour, this end of this Buddha fortunate eon, the last one, one thousand Buddha,

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:33.080
 Buddha, and that duration is roughly known as one eons. Or every very major really

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:43.560
 according correctly, the universal to form this universe, it takes one twenty eons,

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:51.640
 small twenty eons, and to stay this this this universe, it takes twenty eons, and to decline,

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:59.320
 it takes twenty eons, and to completely gone, because as a sky, there's twenty eons, all together

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:09.320
 eighty eons, small eighty eons, eighty eons makes one big eons according the teaching.

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:14.760
 So according the measurement of the time of the Amitabha, the Pure Land of the Skavati,

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:23.480
 the whole hour this eons, whole hour eons, one eon is according their time one day.

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:32.840
 Can you believe? One day, it's one day. So this day, I mean, day is long,

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:40.520
 yay is long for our standard, but for them, it's day, that's what they make it.

00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:49.400
 So now, lifespans of the Pure Land of Amitabha, whoever they, not just only Amitabha and Amitayu,

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:56.920
 or Amitabha and Amitayu, whatever we name, called name is the same Buddha, but at the lifespans in

00:19:56.920 --> 00:20:02.520
 Magyaribha, but who born in that Pure Land, who take the birth, is also in Magyaribha.

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:11.080
 There's no names of the getting old, sicknesses, a death of the existence, or not achieving the

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:11.720
 goal,

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:18.360
 what we want, and losing our weakness and all that. According the teaching, there's none of those

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:27.160
 exist. It's all, everything is spontaneously accomplished. There is even no names of the

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:34.600
 suffering, difficulty, troubles, and melancholy. Really, that is what the Pure Land is.

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:42.120
 Where is this Pure Land? And again, Ananda asked to Buddha Shakyamuni, "Where this Pure Land is?"

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:50.920
 She said, "Ananda, look to the western directions, facing western directions." And that moment,

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:59.080
 Buddha Shakyamuni met great medical closest, and he opened the door, and he sees all the Pure Land

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:06.360
 with the Buddha Amitabhas, and all the who are habitating in the Pure Land of Amitabha.

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:12.710
 And then Buddha Amitabha, sorry, Buddha Shakyamuni said, "Get up, do the post check, and put in

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:13.320
 hand,

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:17.720
 throw flowers towards that Pure Land that you're making, offering the flowers."

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:25.080
 That's what really it is. So it's like leaving Buddha right now. It's this. That is the Pure Land.

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:31.400
 To take the birth in the Pure Land of Amitabha, according the teaching, and also Amitabha's

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:39.400
 aspiration of bodhicitta is so easy. What do you have to do? There is poor,

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:46.680
 the old practitioners, that we should do poor things. Again, the greatest teacher,

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:55.720
 Buddha Shakyamuni said in the teaching, said, "O Ananda, whoever thinking of the Buddha Amitabha,

00:21:56.360 --> 00:22:05.720
 clearly of that whole Amitabha environment and Amitabha." And so that's the one. Thinking of that,

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:12.440
 with that thinking, and accumulating a lot of medical activities. That is the second.

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:23.240
 Third, really good heart bodhicitta and a dedicated merit to be born,

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:32.360
 rebirth in Pure Land devotees. The fourth, again and again, praying, wishing,

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:38.840
 "When I leave this world, may I take the birth in Pure Land of Amitabha."

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:49.320
 Thinking and putting those aspirations again and again, many times. If you do that in the teaching,

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:57.960
 again, Amitabha suttas. Whoever does that, when that individual time comes,

00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:10.200
 time comes, Amitabha, with all Amitabha, and all the retinas of the bodhisattvas and arhatas,

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:18.760
 well come to that individual, right in front of their vision, to that individual vision.

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:25.240
 When they see Amitabha, that individual sees the Buddha Amitabha and all the retinas,

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:33.080
 that individual, the one who's passing, he or he or she was so delighted, so calm and so peaceful,

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:40.840
 and never going to experience the troubles of the going through or end of the lives.

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:49.640
 Very delighted, happy, and relaxed, open, calm. When you that individually pass the last breath

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:58.920
 with those attitudes, surely that individually will take rebirth in Pure Land of Amitabha.

00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:06.440
 That's it, that's the really teaching. So those are known as poor causes

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:12.120
 of the rebirth, taking rebirth in the Pure Land of Amitabha.

00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:18.840
 Now, what in the teaching is it? Many great masters said, "Of course we're doing so much practices,

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:25.560
 we're practicing Mahamudra practices, we're practicing Dzokhi practices, and Mademaka

00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:31.960
 practices, the Pandya Paramatas, all the two practices. All those practices, excellent,

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:39.240
 beautiful, but additionally if we do these practices, it's really additional to our support

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:46.040
 to get enlightenment. We're not just the only thing like to get rebirth in Pure Land,

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:53.560
 but because our principal goal is to fulfill the bodhicata commitment. When we talk the bodhicata

00:24:53.560 --> 00:25:01.240
 vows, what we said, or to benefit all living beings, I like to develop the bodhicata. I'm

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:07.480
 checking to develop the bodhicata. So in the true development of the bodhicata, in this world,

00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:13.810
 for example, there are so many challenges. Since our courage and commitment to realization is not

00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:14.040
 so

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:20.120
 strong, therefore there are always so many hindrance, ups and downs, almost like we are

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:26.920
 walking on the slippery, muddy states, ups and downs, we're falling again, we restrengthen,

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:32.840
 we're activated, we fall back to the ditch, and then again we get up there. I mean we go on and

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:38.840
 on that, but when we detect the rebirth in Pure Land, Dzokhi, according to the teaching,

00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:44.600
 there are no obstacles. All the favorable conditions of the practice of the bodhicata

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:51.160
 fulfill the goal and obligation of this realization. Really, it's so beautiful, so simple, so easy,

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:57.960
 because it gets discussed naturally, that energy activated, and then practice is really activated.

00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:04.360
 Also in the teaching, the great master, Rakaama Chami, the Ragaakse said in the teaching,

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:09.560
 when you take the birth in Pure Land, Amitabha, it's not something that you just have to be there

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:18.360
 all the time, because now you develop, we develop the realization, our traveling or our connection,

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:27.320
 contact is not limited by the boundaries. We can do traveling many places, many Pure Land,

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:33.560
 to come to this universe, and what the great master, Rakaama Chami said, come every time when

00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:39.240
 each Buddha comes. For example, like Pete the Buddha, Six the Buddha, Seven the Buddha, Ed the

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:44.440
 Buddha, all those Buddha come, you come here, receive the teaching, and then go back to the

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:50.440
 Pure Land Amitabha. And not just only that, he said, go to the Pure Land, go all the like five

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:56.680
 dine of Pure Land, receive teachings, and return back to the Amitabha Pure Land, or to the Copper

00:26:56.680 --> 00:27:04.920
 Glory Mountains and Pure Land, or as well as as many other Pure Land, really traveling, receive

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:12.040
 teachings, and returning back, and that means we are not really wasting time, we are saving time,

00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:21.480
 we are accumulating marriage, one after another. So this is what this poor, poor causes take,

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:31.080
 rebirth or reborn in the Pure Land Amitabha. It is simple, easy, and it is very effective.

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:36.920
 What is the teaching said? Remembering of the Pure Land, Amitabha and Pure Land,

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:45.000
 and accumulating the marriage, lot of good marriage activities, and bodhicitta,

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:50.440
 and dedicating marriage, or bodhicitta, and dedicating marriage with aspirations.

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:59.560
 To take rebirth in the Pure Land, myself, as well as all the beings. And we have their thoughts,

00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:07.960
 those are known as poor causes to rebirth, take rebirth in the Pure Land. And now I go a little

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:15.880
 bit over, over, over this, we have, I'm sure you have this phrase, this is a short phrase,

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:22.520
 a very short phrase. Amitabha practices very popular in Mahayana Buddhism, not just only

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:28.840
 Tibetan Buddhism. In all the really Mahayana Buddhism schools, like everyone, say China,

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:35.880
 and as well as Japan, then of course Tibet, also there's poor schools, so many schools of Buddhism,

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:42.760
 everyone really practices Amitabha, practices very popular. And then that, but this is that,

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:48.120
 also each of those great lineage master of the different schools wrote the prayers of Amitabha,

00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:55.000
 so many, but this, what we're following now is according to the Numa schools that made Buddhism,

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.880
 teaching that. And then also we have, in this booklet, we have the very popular one,

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:05.780
 the first one is very popular to everyone, all the schools of Buddhism, and lastly there's a prayer

00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:05.800
,

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:14.120
 is all the middle of this praise, such as this praise, home, the turning well of Dharma in the

00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:21.480
 land of Devaji. This is the teaching of the Raga Aksi or Karma Chami, the very famous practitioners

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:28.760
 and a great master, Siddharth of the Numa and Akaji schools of Tibet Buddhism. And he is really

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:34.840
 one of the great practitioners of the Amitabha, and his teaching, almost every teaching has some

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:40.760
 teachings of the connected Amitabha practices. So this was his teaching, and the next one is

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:47.800
 Namchi Mejo Doji. This one, this is A.M.Ao, a wonderful Amitabha. That is also teaching,

00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:54.600
 according to the teaching when Namchi Mejo Doji was about 13 years old, Amitabha and

00:29:54.600 --> 00:30:04.360
 Chini, and Santhuchintabha of Mejappani appeared right in front of the Namchi Mejo Doji, the young

00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:12.550
 boy, 13 years old, about that old, and gave taught these teachings, teaching, this short one, A.M.A

00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:12.680
o,

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:21.560
 so we have this, this, and then follow me here. Here, here was this page three, page three,

00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:31.880
 when I pass from the life that instantly, and this one is this four, what is called six lines.

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:39.960
 This is again teaching of the great teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni, and this is adopted or adopted

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:54.040
 from the King of Aspirations in Tibet. It is a very famous aspiration prayer. According to the

00:30:54.040 --> 00:31:02.520
 teaching, every master, you say this aspiration prayer compasses or condenses all the aspiration

00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:10.440
 prayers of the bodhisattvas. Every bodhisattvas should do these prayers because this has all the

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:17.320
 aspirations, good aspiration prayer, beneficial aspiration prayers, and from that, that it is

00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:25.800
 adopted that. And last one is again, Buddha Amitabha's mantras, very popular Pemu's ones,

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:33.320
 long one, is again teaching. So that is the, this short one here. So now, if we talk about these

00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:39.160
 four causes to the great birth of Amitabha, according these contracts, according this,

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:49.960
 if I try to go over that. And now, what it is here, here, here is it. Blessed one, thus gone,

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:59.800
 subjube, emiti, perfectly fully enlightened protector Amitabha. So that is what great teacher

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:09.000
 Buddha said in his teaching, the Amitabha Sutras, who, Ananda, whoever individually,

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:16.920
 thinking of the Buddha Amitabha again and again, thinking of the Buddha Amitabha,

00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:24.440
 and it is pure land again and again. So that is what it is really condenses. So that means

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:33.560
 post the cause of the visualizing and meditating the presence of the pure land of Amitabha

00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:41.080
 and Amitabha with old retinas. So that is among the four causes, post the cause.

00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:51.320
 Post, so you visualize, you meditate. Even in the Suttara teaching, generally there is not much

00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:57.640
 explained about the visualizations. But the Buddha mentioned, for example, Samadhi Raja Suttaras

00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:58.200
 said,

00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:15.720
 "Whoever, the golden body is like a golden mountain or golden, golden body,

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:25.080
 splendid a golden mountain, golden body, and the lord or protector or the protector of the world

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:34.280
 is so utterly beautiful, utterly beautiful, and the body is a golden color. Who ever think that

00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:44.280
 Buddha in this way, that is the meditation of the bodhisattvas, bodhisattva meditating,

00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:52.520
 on every kind of way, trying to put that kind of more easy way or maybe at least my mind,

00:33:52.520 --> 00:34:01.640
 that bodhisattva, whoever thinking that Buddha is a beautiful golden, splendid, and beautiful,

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:10.200
 right in front of the bodhisattva, whoever thinks that, that is meditation.

00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:18.520
 That is meditation. So many great masters say in the Suttara teaching, not clearly

00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:24.680
 highly lighted of the visualization practices, but this is also one of the teaching that really

00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:32.120
 explains visualizations. In this case, Amitabha, also true. Now we are going to visualize or

00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:43.400
 meditate Amitabha and all the retinues and pure land Amitabha. And that is so the post-course

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:54.440
 to visualize and meditate. And how did pure land Amitabha, as already I said, is so beautiful,

00:34:54.440 --> 00:35:07.320
 so marvelous, and it is that this unbelievable joy, peace, happiness, relax, and fulfillment,

00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:14.840
 there's not really any troubles, name, name of the troubles, exactly, ever existing. That is pure

00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:22.680
 land Amitabha, pure Amitabha. Everything is beautiful. And so that is really what pure land.

00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:28.120
 So we visualize, for as the great teacher, Buddha Hekamuni said, in the Western direction, where is

00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:33.960
 that? In the Western direction, our universe, this universe where we are, little higher according

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:39.320
 to the teaching, looks a little higher, higher and there is the pure land of the Amitabha.

00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:49.480
 It's perfectly, all that, the vastness of beauty, comfort, and the appealing and the pleasing,

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:55.720
 those are has no limitation. It's just so infinite. And who has resided there?

00:35:55.720 --> 00:36:03.800
 Buddha Amitabha, residing. How is the Buddha Amitabha? It's one face, two arms, two legs, sitting

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:04.120
 on the

00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:13.640
 lotus, one toe and feet at the lotus. Lotus above that moon, moon dress or moon cushion, cushion.

00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:20.920
 Above that, Buddha Amitabha is sitting with the lotus postures. And the backside of Buddha Amitabha

00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:20.920
,

00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:28.200
 there is Bodhi tree, the wish probability trees that has all the qualities of the trees,

00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:35.400
 beautiful qualities, and granted all the wishes, wishes. Buddha Amitabha is a relaxing, calm,

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:42.250
 peaceful, with compassion, looking to all the living beings without any exception or discrimination

00:36:42.250 --> 00:36:42.360
,

00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:47.400
 really love and compassion, all that. So that is Buddha Amitabha, is a major,

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:54.280
 the 32 major marks and 80 manual marks, exactly the same as Buddha Shakyamuni or the Buddhas,

00:36:54.280 --> 00:37:02.040
 and emanating so many boundless light to us, to all the beings for six rims. Feel strongly that

00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:10.040
 presence, calm, peaceful, joy, and happy with that. And the right side of Buddha Amitabha is

00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:17.560
 then Bodhisattva, the two principal disciples. And right side is Avalokiteshara, Chinese,

00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:26.440
 white in the colors, and also in the right hand. Right hand is a gesture of the protection

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:31.880
 mother. Protection mother, like hand, palms hold up, and the protection mother is like this.

00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:38.920
 And the left hand, he hold white lotus. That lotus has six patterns that open their own,

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:46.360
 his air levels. And the left side of this Buddha Amitabha is, again, supreme disciples.

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:56.680
 And Vaidyapani, and also Vaidyapani's name, another name is Tuchintop, power of all the abilities.

00:37:56.680 --> 00:38:05.000
 So that's Tuchintop and Vaidyapani, same. And the color is blue. And again, right hand is

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:13.080
 a protection mother. Left hand is again holding blue lotus. Above that, he's holding Vaidyapani,

00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:20.760
 five pointy Vaidyapani. Both Bodhisattva's eyes are standing up, and the Sambukaya ornaments,

00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:30.440
 such as that means what? Those five clothes, five suit clothes, and eight jewels, that including

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:37.720
 ear chrome, earrings, and necklace, long necklace, short necklace, medium necklace,

00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:48.200
 armlets, anklelets, and bracelets, and all those. Those are eight jewels and a stand.

00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:53.320
 And these two, these are three principle enlightened beings, the Buddha Amitabha,

00:38:53.320 --> 00:39:03.080
 Nithyananda, and Vaidyapani surrounded by all the Bodhisattvas. So many Bodhisattvas,

00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:09.240
 countless in the teachings, really surrounded by so many Bodhisattvas, so many Arhathas.

00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:17.080
 Those Arhathas appeared as a form of Arhatha, but they are great Bodhisattvas, all Bodhisattvas.

00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:24.760
 And they all are right in front of us and looking to us with the eye of love and the

00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:30.040
 compassion of Vaidyapani, and emanating light of love and the compassion of Vaidyapani,

00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:37.400
 from the Buddha Amitabha, and as well as our Lokurikura, Vaidyapani, to us, and to all the beings,

00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:43.080
 instantly removing all the obstacles, obscurations, handiness, negativities,

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:49.480
 ours, and every living being, really feel that strongly, strongly, in front of that,

00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:56.360
 then such as us, not just according to my teaching, not just I'm standing, I'm praying,

00:39:56.360 --> 00:40:02.920
 but we think, inviting all the beings with six rims, they are now really opening their heart,

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:09.960
 troubled by the Amitabha, and Vaidyapani, and our Lokurikura. They're all chanting,

00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:15.880
 they're all praying, talking, one point of the thought, that everyone likes to remove their

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:22.520
 obscurations, obstacles, for all the Bodhisattva commitment, discovering our innate nature,

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:29.880
 Buddha nature, everyone, and that also Bodhisattvas are emanating so many lights,

00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:38.360
 light to us, really feel so strongly, calm, comfortable, and with a pull of confidence.

00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:43.240
 And the teaching said, if you have the confidence and with the devotions,

00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:51.000
 Bodhisattvas are right there. Actually, every hour activities, our performance are relying

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:59.880
 right tip of our intentions. If we put the intentions, the rest will come, and we have

00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:06.360
 the courage and the commitment and the joyful effort. It really follows that. So therefore,

00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:12.280
 what the gracious teacher, Bodhisattva community said, everything is a condition, a circumstance,

00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:18.600
 that circumstance and a condition is the intention. And we have the intention,

00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:29.800
 determinations, that means also intention, and we have that. The result, what we wish will follow.

00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:37.400
 Therefore, we think that every living being really will purify all obscurations. In a way,

00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:44.760
 when we are practicing, we are representing all the beings of six realms to bring them peace,

00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:52.920
 joy, happiness, performance, realization, remove all the unwanted obstacles,

00:41:54.440 --> 00:42:01.240
 hindrance, obscurations, really feel that. And that is known as the visualizations of the

00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:10.760
 object of a rafuj or possible cause. What the gracious teacher said, I said quite a few times,

00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:17.960
 ananda, remember, whoever remember, thinking of the Buddha Amitabhas again and again.

00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:26.760
 Amitabha is violent and rational. That's amazing. That's what we think again and again.

00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:35.000
 Then with that, now what the gracious teacher said, the second cause. The second cause is

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:41.400
 to accumulate the merits. What the teaching said, Amitabha Sudhar said,

00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:53.160
 accumulate the imaginary activities. So that is merit. Now, meritorious activities. You do.

00:42:53.160 --> 00:43:00.920
 And the meritorious activity is again, you all know, the bodhijata, the best one in the bodhijata

00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:08.040
 and the good heart, the heart and the earth. All that is also really a highlight of the

00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:16.440
 positive action, negative action, trying to avoid negative actions and accumulate more positive

00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:26.440
 activities, more positive activities and really bodhijata thoughts. And then also each time when

00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:34.360
 you do the practice, dedicated that merit, may I and every living being by this cause to take

00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:35.000
 rebirth

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:42.440
 in the purely Amitabhas. Myself, all the beings, all our loved ones, all our friends, family

00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:43.160
 members

00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:48.920
 and all the sentient beings, really everyone reach enlightenment and birth, take the birth

00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:57.720
 in purely Amitabha. So that is my brilliant talk for today. And which means I spoke among poor

00:43:57.720 --> 00:44:06.280
 causes of the Amitabha. To take rebirth in the Amitabha, I spoke first one, visualizing the

00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:17.240
 Amitabha, it is pure land and the rationals. That's I spoke and then I go over the second and third

00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:25.080
 and the fourth. That is firstly, second is again, accumulated merit, as mentioned. And then

00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:33.000
 with bodhijata, that is third and fourth is aspiration prayer with the dedicating or

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:39.640
 dedicating with the aspiration prayers. That is fourth. Those four are, if we do this,

00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:45.960
 if we do it, if we can do it every day, just a short time, even these short prayers,

00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:53.400
 then really it is good. Three times this joined and joined the mantra with that intention and

00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:59.960
 dedicating merit for all the beings. And that is a very special practices to benefit ourselves

00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:05.640
 and to others. As I said, even we practice very famous and very, very high in the practice of

00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:12.440
 very under teaching. But if we do this addition, it is really quite very good. It just, it will

00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:19.800
 make our thing more comfortable, more smooth and more direct to the performance of all our

00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:20.520
 practices.

00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:25.720
 So that is my talk for today and thank you very much everyone. Your body is speaking. Okay. Thank

00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:36.360
 you. Thank you everyone. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. And then so we, maybe we do a short time,

00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:42.520
 these prayers, really we do short time and you all have these prayers. So again, we do this prayer

00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:47.640
 short time and then after that we do short dedicating prayer and that we completed then

00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:54.840
 our first session. The second session we're going to our, our daily practices of that. If you like

00:45:54.840 --> 00:46:00.440

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:20.200
 Blessed one, thus gone should you be emitted. Perfectly, fully enlightened, protectable Amitabha.

00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:26.520
 To you I pay homage, make offerings and go for refuge. Please bless me so that we build in a

00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:33.800
