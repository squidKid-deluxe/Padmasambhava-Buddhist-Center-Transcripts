00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 Thank you very much. Happy New Year. And this year begins the very New Years. The Water Tiger Years

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.240
.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:16.520
 I wish you all the best, good health, joy, peace, a lot of realizations, and fulfillment in

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.120
 everything.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:24.880
 And then I wish peace in the world, and harmony in the world, and really this year,

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:31.360
 and normal natural disasters, and difficult troubles, and disease, all that will be dispelled

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:38.160
 by the blessing of the Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, and Gurdwai Masambhavaya, and Tara. I pray for this.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.800
 This year, or the end of this year, has become the very challenged years, many different levels.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.880
 In the spiritual world, many greater beings die and tell Mahapari Nivalas. And as well as in

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:57.200
 the samsara world level, there is a lot of disturbance going on right now. So we all wish,

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:05.920
 wish, are peace, happy, and respect, and appreciate every living being, and each other's. And that

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:12.320
 started from our heart, not from outside. So that's what the great teacher, Buddha Shatyamuni,

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:18.240
 and Gurdwai Masambhavaya said that. So therefore, we began that really peaceful, more digital

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.720
 solution in our heart, and wish that good things to all living beings, to pray well to everywhere,

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:32.320
 where, and coming this world, for following, and for coming this world, as a golden egg. Really

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.720
 wish

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:39.440
 that prayer, okay. Trashy Delhi, best wishes, and then again, I'm going to do short prayer,

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:46.080
 and which is taught by the great master, His Holiness, Dhanjiro Moochai, Jai Gracchidodya,

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.560
 and that I'm going to pray in a little bit.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:02:07.840
 Thank you, Shaty Delhi. Happy New Year, thank you.
