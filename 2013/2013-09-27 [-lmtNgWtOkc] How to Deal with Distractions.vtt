00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 It is meditation. Meditation and relaxing ourself in calm and peaceful manner and status.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 In order to do that, what have to be avoided? As we call it, avoid the distractions.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 The distractions are the opposite of the disturbance of being ourself, like in peace.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 And we don't have the peaceful quietness, our inner beauty of the calm and peaceful.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 Sude will not arise, not shine through. It is similar as water is disturbed.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.140
 Water is completely stirred up there, and there is muddies all the time, so we can't really see the

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.000
 clay water itself.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 Similarly, present time, our mind is completely disturbed and distracted by weight.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.230
 Or maybe I shouldn't say completely, but most of the time our mind is completely disturbed and

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.000
 distracted by all the distractions that we go.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 Externally and internally we go. And externally we are distracted by all the external activities,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 all such objects of the six senses of the external things.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 We are completely disturbed. Or particularly also, I can say, five senses.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 And those five senses are objects of what? Object sense and "I". Object "I" is forms.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 And object "I" is sounds. And object of "nose" is smells.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 And object of "taste" is "tust".

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 And object of "tone" is "taste".

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 And object of "body" is "touch".

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 And then plus the sex mode, and next also not sex mode, but one more.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 And it is known as the imagination.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.290
 The imagination of your mind is the imagination sense, recollecting of the past memories, or the

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.000
 personal thoughts,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.190
 or the future plans were on and on and disturbed by the kind of completely carried way that in our

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.000
 brains we hover it all the time.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 And those are known as then the distractions.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.400
 So that distraction is externally happening. And inadvertently also then you are busy with the

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.000
 mental kind of busy.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 So then you are in the kind of time of the calm and the peaceful so that we can relax.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 This is the manual obstacles.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 And therefore, to avoid those things, then what the teaching said, due to the hermitage.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 Hermitage is then something that has led less those distractions.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.800
 Even though, of course, as long as your duality mind is not completely finished yet, there is

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:02.000
 always distractions.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 But however, the hermitage is more better because there are less distractions.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 So therefore, in the teaching, what do you say?

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.090
 Say the hermitage of the busyness of that external world is reduced because of being in the hermit

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.000
age level.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 So there are less busyness. And then that is not enough.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 We also have to be hermitage of our mental activities.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 And so therefore, external hermitage, being as hermitage places, is hermitage.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 Inworldly hermitage is being associated with mundane conceptions.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 And this thought is known as inner hermitages.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:55.190
 By having these two hermitages, we can bring strength of the state of mind or the realization will

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:56.000
 shine.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 And now, among all the distractions in the samsara, one of the most desirable is,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 particularly in the human world, or in what is called desire realms.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 In the Buddha's teaching, again, you know that there are three realms.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 Desire realms, and poem realms, and poem-less realms.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 There are three realms.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 And why it's called desire realms, post-desire realms?

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 It's something that you decide so much all the time.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 Time, one of the most powerful desires, is to be associated with the partners.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 This is the, the airport is called desire realms.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:53.180
 As the more attracted poem-brain and poem-less realms don't have that strength, that duties, duties

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.000
, as desire realms.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 Desire realms have such a strong desire that like to be with partners.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 That is very strong.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 For that reason, in the teaching, name entire this realm as desire realms.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 So, among that, therefore, this, again, among all the object of the destructions,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 being with it, like, what's called the partner, is the very, very desire.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 And also, it is very destructive.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 Have you like to stay in the peaceful?

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.670
 Have you like to bring more tranquility in our mind, in our heart, in the realization, to bring

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.000
 more realization?

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 Then have you distracted with that?

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 It is.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 It's very big destructions.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 So, among that destructions, and this is, of course, teaching is more focused.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 They really had the first of how it started.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 It started with the male, male person, who was a king, king.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 King is male.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:08.710
 Therefore, then, a great master used terminology as targeted as like, 'pee man, pee man, you should

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:09.000
 not be.'

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 Be designed, attracted.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:19.000
 You should feel what you have is enough and not looking something more than that what you have.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 That is what this great master explained.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 And that is, again, here.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 And then, how we do this?

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 This is generally, again, in the sense we are ready in the practitioners,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 and as well as my own practitioners.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 There is three different ways to kind of, like, make ourselves stronger.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:52.780
 The fourth is, is the post-heal, this teaching is encompassed entirely like teachings of the Budd

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:53.000
has.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 Hennayana teaching, Mahayana teaching, and Vaidyana teachings.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 But it is more, also, highlighted as teachings of the Mahayanas.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:11.000
 So therefore, in the Mahayana way, how we should try to less desire ourself.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 Self.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 And then, same time, he is adding according as Hennayana levels, how we should do that.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 So he can highlight this great master to the Mahayana systems as well as Hennayana systems.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:34.180
 And for all the Mahayana systems, we put some here, but I will, again, roughly go through these

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:37.000
 translations and see.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:02.180
 Then, here is a, if you see someone else, a wife, should not look to them with attachment,

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:04.000
 attachment.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 Even you start kind of attaching at the first time, but immediately catch up your mindfulness.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 Mindfulness, if there is similar edge, you should see as your sisters.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 According to the edge, you should see that as sisters.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 If they are older than yourself, you should see them as your mothers.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:42.980
 If they are younger than yourself, or that person is younger than yourself, you should see as your

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:45.000
 daughters.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 Through these three manners, three techniques, you should try to avoid, avoid desire, attachment.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
 See them as these three different methods.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 See this.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 This is a great master, and a great master, you see, this is the Mahayana way techniques.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 We are trying to perceive them.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 This is, again, as I said, the first instruction, when all this is to the king.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 So, it is to the males, in a way, male's aspects.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
 But also, his teaching is for the females too.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
 Teachings is not just for the men.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:33.000
 In that way, father, brother, and son, you should perceive that, and try to avoid.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:42.990
 Avoid the desires, and should, that also help in the way he dared not imagine, when you see the

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:44.000
 wife or others.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 That means, what do you have, wife, or what do you have?

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.000
 You should be happy.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
 You should be satisfied with joy with that.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 Not just craving so many one up another, and a young opponent from places like that.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 You should be happy and joyless.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:09.000
 At that, they didn't have that health, and then the Hinayana structures.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 And that is then seeing duty.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 It's not so beautiful.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:21.300
 We are attracted, because our senses are attracted in a desire, seeing something pleasure, and

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:23.000
 beautiful, nice.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 And therefore, and then, seeing something that is not so pleasant, as unclean things.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:38.230
 And that is then again, this great Master's teaching, in the next few lives, or next few inverses,

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:42.000
 how we should perceive things that.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:50.440
 And so, this is the one that, when you have this, how this you can perceive in this many different

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:52.000
 level, levels, ways.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 And to avoid attachment.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 That grasping, that crying, that craving, that things.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 And treat it, to do it.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
 In the very end, teaching what?

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 It's still teaching.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 Seeing everything as a deworming.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 Seeing as everything is Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 All the deities, male and female, God and goddesses.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 God and goddesses of Buddha, male and female Buddhas, enlightened beings.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 And you also think that they want to speak to you.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 And transcendent every those emotions, crying, in that instant status.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 Then, this is known as great practitioners.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
 That is what is known as radiant practitioners.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:40.000
 So, apply the according of our capabilities, and our things.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 And what it is, is to avoid that grasping, that clinging.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
 That is what we should be.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
 So, that is really about that.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 And then, of course, this other next great masters.
