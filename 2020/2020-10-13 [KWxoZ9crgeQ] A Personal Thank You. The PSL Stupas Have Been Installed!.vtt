Even when it is gone, the dust of this place will continue to generate merit and benefit to all those connected to this project. According to that, we dedicate this merit.\n\nBy this merit may all obtain omniscience.\nMay it defeat the enemy, wrong-doing.\nFrom the stormy waves of birth, old age, sickness, and death,\nFrom the ocean of samsara, may I free all beings.",
