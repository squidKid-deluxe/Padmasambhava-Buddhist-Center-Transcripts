00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.240
 Love and to avoid attachment. The Buddhist teaching encourages us to practice love and to avoid

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.000
 attachment.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.650
 In the case of non-unveying lay practitioners, how do we practice love without attachment in close

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.000
 relationships?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 For example, how does a Buddhist husband love his wife without attachment?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 Or, how does a Buddhist mother or father love their children without attachment?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:36.970
 That's a really very good answer. I'm a good question. However, because there is love and

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.000
 compassion,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 the ultimate love and compassion taking care of others comes without attachment.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 Attachment is designated. Designated attachments are partialities, even though for the time being

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 it is good,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 maybe it is important, but attachment is limited. Limited, targeted things, attachment.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.660
 Therefore, it is a grasp. When you don't have attachment, that doesn't change your love to your

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.000
 wife or your husband.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 Actually, it becomes so divine, so beautiful, so natural. It's not become the emotion.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 It's not become the roller-coaster up and down. It's continued as sunshine states.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:38.150
 So soothing, so calming, yet that is to everyone. So therefore, attachment is grasping, is

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.000
 narrowing, is limited, is partialities.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 And free from attachment, as is it. It's total open, total free. You care your, as is sober.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:01.990
 As a Buddha cares, his son Raghula, he didn't say anything like that, but as well as his love to

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.000
 everyone.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:14.410
 So therefore, loving kindness in confusion without attachment is more profound, more natural, more

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:15.000
 open.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 And there is no involvement of the anger and the jealous, heavy thought, this and that.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 All that comes with attachment, unless we want to kind of crush it and break it by the anger,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 headed, jealous.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 Then attachment is okay. Thank you.
