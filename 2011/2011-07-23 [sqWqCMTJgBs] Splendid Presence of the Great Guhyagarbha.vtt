00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 Thanks for us, for all of us, really. Thank you. Everyone who participated and supported to bring

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:19.440
 out this magnificent one, and which is known as "Great Guhyagarbha Splendid Present of Great

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:33.280
 Guhya Gharbha," now it finally came. Thank you. This is all teaching of the Buddha and

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:39.920
 Gaurapayama Sambo and all the great masters. And also, last year, right before Kanki Parthikarambh

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:40.240
aji

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.440
 and Tranit Mahapari Narvana, he mentioned, he said, "I'm very happy to see all the many

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.800
 beautiful books are coming with the assistance of the many Sangha members." These books are

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:57.120
 very true teaching of what we try and follow, the exiled teaching of the Buddha and Gaurapayama,

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:04.240
 some of the other great masters. We are really trying to stay right on the line,

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:12.560
 now. And so therefore, it is good at the beginning, it is good in the middle, it is good now,

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.760
 and it will be good in the future. So therefore, it is one of the great accomplishments and good

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.600
 things. And I then like to do prayer together with all of us. We make this offering to all the

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:30.000
 Buddhas and Bodhisattvas in light wings, and master of three lineages, master of the mind-to-mind

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.960
 transmission lineage, mind-to-mind, and master of the sambole transmission lineage, and mind,

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.920
 and master of the order transmission lineage, and karma, and dharma, all these great masters,

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.920
 and all the practitioners and Sangha members. By making these offerings, whatever the merit is

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.640
 generated, we get dedicated to all the sentient beings to bring everyone joy, peace, happiness,

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.880
 realization, ignite their enlightened natures, absolute Gaurapayama sambhava. And we all revere

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.760
 that beauty in nature, and get enlightenment, beautiful medalla of the Gaurapayama sambhava,

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:14.240
 and the Buddha Amitabha. And so that is my week, and that is the week of all us. To highlight that,

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.200
 I'm going to do some prayers of the Buddhas and Gaurapayama sambhava, the words of the

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.720
 regular word, blessed word. So I will pray, join your intention, and as well as that prayer

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.760
 that you all know, we may do that prayer one time.
