00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.140
 Aamitabha, a living Buddha, Buddha Aamitabha, and the reincarnation of the Buddha Shakyamuni,

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:16.060
 in a way two great Buddhas are combined and one single poem is in Gaurabhema Sambha. He's

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:23.200
 already enlightened beings and already Buddha, but yet on the relative level, the Gaurabhema

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:30.360
 Sambha also received Vajrakilaya teachings and practices Vajrakilaya, in a way it becomes

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:38.640
 as his like Yidam. Vajrakilaya practice, Vajrakilaya become as his impersonal practices of the

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.560
 Gaurabhema Sambha and through the Vajrakilaya practices, he subdued all the negative forces

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:53.840
 and obstacle, obscurations and there's a long history of how Vajrakila Sambha overcome by

00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:03.680
 practicing Vajrakilaya in the obstacles in Nepal. So this is his personal practices Vajrakilaya was

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.840
 and as it was very so important and special and when Gaurabhema Sambha came to Tibet, then he

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.800
 started also giving teachings on Vajrakilaya many times again and again. So this teaching becomes

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:17.040
 so

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.560
 popular, so powerful practice throughout the Buddhist history from the 8th century until now.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:30.200
 And there's so many Vajrakilaya Thelma teachings, both Kama and the Thelma teachings, but also this

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:36.110
 particular Vajrakila is known as the union of the Vajrakilaya and the Yanda Heruka together. So

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:36.320
 this

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:44.280
 Yanda Heruka and Vajrakilaya, Yanda really in the New York schools of Buddhism, you heard that's

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:53.550
 called Ad Heruka. At Heruka, among the Ad Heruka, Vajrakila is the fifth Heruka and the Yanda Her

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.760
uka

00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:01.040
 is third Heruka. So it's called the body related with Heruka that related with all the bodies of

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:08.320
 the Buddhas and Heruka that related all the speech of the Buddhas, Heruka that related with all the

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:15.800
 Buddhist mind of the Buddhas, Heruka that related with all the qualification of the Buddhas and Her

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.320
uka

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:23.680
 that related with all the activities of Buddhas. Among that particularly five Buddhas, Herukas and

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:31.840
 this is practiced as combination of that both. That was this practice actually performed and

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:32.320
 practiced

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:39.820
 by Gurbel Mahasambhava. Hence, according to his story in Nepal, the Parping, older town is called

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:45.280
 Parping and the debate is called the Yangnishu. It's a very famous KVAR, Gurbel Mahasambhava,

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:52.720
 it earned Vajrakilaya status. By combining the Togada Yanda Heruka, the third Heruka Buddha of the

00:02:52.720 --> 00:03:00.310
 at Herukas and the fifth Buddha Heruka of the at Heruka, combined the Togada by doing that

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.960
 immediately

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:08.160
 he subdued and overcome all the obstacles that was kind of happening before his practices. So this

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.320
 is

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:15.200
 one of the heart essence of the practice of heartly connected, very hard to close the connected

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:21.680
 teachings of the Gurbel Mahasambhava that which is hidden, Togada with Vasilaka Ikhimsoja

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.680
 and revered by famous Nirmatetu Thaksa Numba. So that is a brilliant story. If you'd like to know

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:34.800
 more about this hardness practice, all that, there's quite good books of this that we wrote by K.T.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:40.480
 Parthisharambhaji and I had a great opportunity, opportunity to join with him. So we have a book

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:47.040
 called the Dark Red Amulet Practices, which is quite detailed and quite thorough and also

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:53.280
 revealing the deep meaning of these practices. Not just only that, but entirely Nirma Histories,

00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:00.480
 Togada with the deep meaning of the Vedyakalaya practices and as well as that means not just only

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:06.390
 this teaching, the entirely Vedyakalayas, what that means. Every Taitung had this teaching because

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.640
 this

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:14.080
 was every Gurbel Mahasambhava, hard practices. Therefore, every Taitungs revere one after another

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:21.920
 Vedyakalaya practices. So that Dark Red Amulet reverse and explaining that essence, the meaning

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:27.600
 and overview of the Vedyakalaya practices. So as I said, if you'd like to know more detail that,

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:33.840
 then you can find there. And so that's the brief history of the Vedyakalaya and now I would give

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.440
 transmission of this. And again, we feel the strong presence of the Gurbel Mahasambhava and all the

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.320
 linear masters with great joy and appreciation. And generally between the great joy and

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.880
 appreciation,

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:50.160
 not just only the time of the transmission then, but this is truly, we are blessed ones. We are

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:55.920
 all blessed ones because we have 14 alive, 14 things are surrendered by us and we have these

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:02.400
 brutal things connected to Dharma, connected to all the brutal abundances. This is really 14 days.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.760
 So therefore, going joy and appreciation and that joy and appreciation connected, combined with

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:08.000
 both

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.880
 each other, we hear every sentence, we have these beautiful things, everything. There's normal

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:13.360
 words,

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:20.160
 normal violence, normal all the destitutions and difficulty, turbulence, great joy, peace,

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.280
 happiness, prosperity, and the respect and appreciation to each other and the move

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:31.200
 today toward the innate goals of the enlightenment. Really, we think those old thoughts, then it's

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:36.720
 become the practice, everything from the ground, from the middle, from the end, all is become the

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:42.000
 Dharma. That's what called the Dharma. I mean that's what you know too. I'm just reminding to you,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.360
 in a way, to myself, that this is our kind of supporting, helping you as much as we can do

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:53.270
 through this way. That's called the Sangha members. So that is a brilliant thought and now, as I

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.520
 said,

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.320
 please be married. Feel the strong presence of all those beautiful things, beautiful those

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.520
 and situations and then I get the transmissions.
