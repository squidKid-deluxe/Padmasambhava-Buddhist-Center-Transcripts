00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.900
 Okay, now the story of the Buddha going up to the Tushita Heaven. In the teaching he said the

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:22.700
 Buddha's mother is Maya Devi, in the Tibetan it's called Jumtral Lamon, and he passed away one week

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:29.000
 after Buddha's birth, one day after Buddha was born,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.690
 and then I think he passed away. So he passed away soon. And then Buddha was nurtured and looking

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:47.210
 up by his sister who became later a nun, the head nun, the first nun, nun, and it's very called Suj

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:57.000
igudamu, the auntie Jigudamu, and the person Jigudamu, that's Jigudamu.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:05.670
 But anyway, so Buddha really didn't have any time on the working level to spend time with Maya Devi

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:13.000
 because he passed away, just one week after his birth, he was born.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.070
 Then when he passed away, she told the birth in the Tushita Heaven. In the Tushita Heaven, when he

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:27.000
 was born, generally in the Tushita Heaven, the birth system is the marathon of the birth.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.690
 The moment you're born and everything is completely alert, there's no kind of stage, there's a

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:39.480
 human baby that we go stage by stage, infant and baby, and the girl out there is already alert, and

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:46.000
 then she's always looking and watching, supported to the Buddha.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:54.630
 Buddha, even though now he is not humanly as physically existing, but he's continually having

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.000
 support to the Buddha.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.250
 And then Buddha, when Buddha meditated in practice in Narayanan bank for six years or near Narayan

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:14.360
an river, at that time Buddha went through very intensive, ascetic practices, and also Buddha, she

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:21.080
 was, she's coming looking after the Buddha, watching after a young Buddha, and really doing all

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.000
 those things.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:30.410
 So now, Buddha became a total enlightenment, when he was age 35, and then he started giving the

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:37.460
 teaching to all those fortunate beings, and many people, so many people reached the Aradahut as a

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:42.000
 realization, similarly Buddha in the teaching said, that happened.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.650
 And then also Buddha went to the capital, back to the father, to his capital, as a meditation by

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:56.120
 his father, K. Buddha gave the teaching, there's a sutta called Yapshinya Rundo, sutta that meeting

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.000
, the father and son, son sutta that Buddha gave.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.930
 So then, they enrolled that time, then one day, then Buddha at one time, and then every year there

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:12.480
 is three months of rainy season retreat, and that is very custom made for the Buddhist monks and

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.000
 nuns, and they stay in one area, they do practices.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:24.010
 And that time, all the villagers and family devoted, support, they will bring the food. Most of the

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:34.820
 time, and as no ancient time, those Buddhist monks and nuns go to the house-to-house, arms bowl,

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:41.150
 and not just collect the food, largely food, but they go to the village, and whatever the food,

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.000
 they got first family gave, and they without discriminating the food,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:53.050
 and accept that food joyfully, and very graciously, and thankfully, and then they bring back that

00:03:53.050 --> 00:04:00.390
 food to their hermitage, or maybe some kind of sport they choose and eat, and then that's it, they

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:06.820
 come by, so they're not also kind of collecting, they're selecting, choosing the food, door to door

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:13.000
, just whatever they got, they just take that, without making any commentaries or anything.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:20.740
 And so that's the stuff, usually, but then the rainy season retreat time, then all those devotees

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:28.570
 will bring the food, and through those ritual places, and then three months, they do retreat in the

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.000
 summer time, every time.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.160
 And then one time, Buddha announced it to every Sangha member, and now, he's going to go to hit

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:48.240
 heaven, due to the three-month rainy season retreat in the hit heaven, and with his mother, and

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:58.000
 gratitude to her, and anybody who has a capability, like miracles power, capability, they can join.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.760
 And if anybody like that, also if they like to come with me, and have the capability, they can join

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:09.500
. Otherwise, then everybody should do the retreat, wherever they are, can't really intend to do all

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:15.000
 that, to come to the, such as the shavastha, and do the retreat, they need to do retreat.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.260
 In Buddha, he knows of that, and then many of those who have capabilities, miracles power, who like

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:28.130
 to go with Buddha, and they went to hit heaven to retreat, and many people see it, also in such the

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:32.000
 shavastha, and other places, they did retreat.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.890
 So now, retreat, summer retreat is ended, ended, and then everybody, and all that, particularly in

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:50.420
 that time, the shavastha, the siddhis, so many, proposed a devotee, and most of the time, Buddha

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:57.910
 did a rainy season retreat in shavastha, over 23 years, over 24 years, and 25 years, it depends how

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:00.000
 you count that, but at a long time.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:08.120
 So shavastha villagers, or siddhis people, has very much used to Buddha, always there. So that year

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.000
, Buddha then is not there to retreat.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:19.220
 And so the Buddha, they ask, "Where is Buddha?" and Buddha doing retreat in a tushita, heaven, to

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:24.000
 pay respect to mother, and so those who want to see it.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.360
 So then, when Buddha is coming back, and as soon as the rainy season retreat, Phoenician will come

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.000
 back.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:38.810
 The rainy season retreat is again, depending on the different calendars, but mostly, this Phoen

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:44.000
ician lost this new moon, and today is according to better than the calendar, is 22nd.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 So over 23 days ago, rainy season, summer retreat, is ended. So now, 23 days, Buddha journey came,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 still, and he lost the Phoenician, so much eager, they missed Buddha.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:10.960
 And so really, they said, "Why Buddha is not coming back? Because we cannot go to God's land. Gods

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.000
 can come to this, on this places, to the earth."

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 And so therefore, Buddha should be here, and so why he is not coming? They all missed.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:27.490
 And finally, everybody decided, all those who have missed so much, and then they thought, "Oh, we

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:30.000
 should really go to the Mongol potter."

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:37.060
 Mongol potter is mostly the miracleist power. We achieve the miracleist power among all the

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:39.000
 disciples of the Buddha.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:46.210
 So we should go and ask him that, "Please, could you go and take the message? We missed so much,

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:47.000
 Buddha."

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:53.800
 And you will tell that, "Please come back here." And again, they say the same thing, "Gods can come

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:59.000
 easily, on this earth, but we cannot go to their places."

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 So therefore, please, could you send the message? Give this message to Buddha.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 So then, the Mongol potter accepted this, is there a corset?

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:16.870
 And the teaching says that, as a youth for a healthy person, the moment they stretch out and bend

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:24.000
 the knee, that amount of time, the Mongol potter is already in the Duchit heaven.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.200
 So stretch out, and this, in that moment, that duration, that Mongol potter is already in the

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:34.000
 Buddha's Duchit heaven,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:41.500
 and then the Mongol potter bow down to the Buddha's feet in respect, fully, and then he gives the

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:43.000
 message to Buddha.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:50.130
 And then Buddha says, "Yes, I will come. I will come in this, according to the Vedic calendar, this

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:51.000
 today."

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:59.000
 "Today that I will come, not in Sharasala, but I will come other place, which is also in India,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:07.000
 called Nipi, in Tibet, called Nipi, ata in Sanskrit, called Sanketa."

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 "So that place still is one of the holy places in India, so I will come there in that day."

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:21.480
 So then, again, Mongol potter came in this direction, kind of like, stretch out in this moment, and

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:28.000
 he is right back to the Sharasala, and he gives the message to this person.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 "Yes, now Buddha is coming. You all made preparation, and you can wear that."

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 So everybody is really eager now to see Buddha, because they miss Buddha almost all three months,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
 and everyone is eager.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 And so then Buddha is coming, now God.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:54.040
 And then in the teaching he said, "Indra, Brahma, and then Bhushokarma, who is the craftsman of the

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.000
 gods."

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 The three of them offered three ladders.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:10.880
 One offered, I think, lapus lajo ladder, and then one offered a golden ladder, and one offered a

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:11.000
 crystal ladder, I think.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 And Indra, Brahma, and Bhushokarma.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:23.000
 So then, Buddha really don't need ladders, actually, come down, so he can come easily, I think.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:29.000
 But however, although Buddha thought, if I don't accept them, then they will be very disappointed,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
 because they are offering that.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:41.440
 So he accepted all that three ladders, ladders, and then Buddha, through his medical support, does

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:46.000
 three ladders, made one ladder, ladder.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:53.480
 So Buddha now has one ladder, three ladder, transformed into one ladder, and Buddha is coming down,

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:54.000
 that heaven.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:00.000
 And then also Buddha thought, "Oh, therefore, I can't convert into this ladder, okay?"

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
 And the many people maybe will be disappointed.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000
 "Oh, why would I have to use this ladder? So they will disappear."

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
 So therefore, what is the purpose of their wish?

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:17.040
 My right lower lap, I don't remember exactly, but feet is available on the ladder, and then that

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:19.000
 other feet is on the space.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 So Buddha is coming with that.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 So now, in the Sankhya, there were big receptions, big receptions.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:33.000
 So many kings and queens and ministers and all that, they came, and they had big receptions.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 Everybody is waiting eagerly, Buddha coming down.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 And then there is that story, something happened.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:48.000
 There is a few moves, a nun, who becomes one of the great ahas, nun, and her name is Upali.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 Upali is a nun, but she has so many students too, and she taught.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:07.000
 The nuns always have to stay second to second line of the monks.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
 And also, I was not really immediately able to see Buddha.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:19.680
 Immediately, I can't see. I mean, according to the rule, I can't really, like that traditional rule

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:20.000
 or whatever the rule,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:27.000
 I cannot really see immediately Buddha, Buddha or Baba, or receive the Buddha immediately.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000
 So therefore, I'm going to use my spiritual Baba. She taught.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
 She taught, because I like to see immediately.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 As soon as the Buddha comes down, I like to receive the Buddha.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 So that's what she did.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:51.000
 She instantly transformed the most magnificent, powerful-looking king.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 She transformed herself as king, and she emanated also many entourage.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 So now, with entourage and king, powerful-looking king, magnificent king, king, everybody was

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
 really like, what's going on?

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
 When king comes down, then everybody kind of like moves.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000
 Including all those ahatas, mums are like moving.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 So she was right in front of the prone road to receive the Buddha.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000
 And so everybody thought, where does this powerful-looking king come from?

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
 Where does he come from? Who is this?

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 I mean, they started thinking of this king is more than Buddha.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
 They're who's this and they're all these things.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 But anyway, and then so she must stay in that form, and she received the Buddha first.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 Or he's the one of the first who received the Buddha.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.000
 Then soon after, then that illusion went even.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 It's a deceived way.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 And when Buddha came down on earth, and then, of course, everybody was so happy.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 And now, the obelisk, that display is also dissolved.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 There is she, she.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 And everybody said, who? So who you are?

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 And then, of course, the most people they know, she, her name is Obali, Obali.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 And then, what is those king?

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 That king and that Angraj, they said.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
 That is, I displayed.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 I displayed because I like to receive the Buddha first.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 Of course, that's why I displayed.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 And they said, it's okay to use the spiritual power.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 They said, when did you? When did you?

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:46.000
 And then she said, whether it is okay or not, I did it.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
 That's the reason.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000
 And then, because I mean, then Buddha came, Buddha came, and all that came.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 But then after that, that story continued in the case.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
 And then it said, how people can use their spiritual power?
