00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.880
 Small, medium, and big, small-minded, medium-minded, and big-minded, or you can use the very

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:13.440
 initial

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:27.040
 word, what's it called, SNL. You know the right word. When we got the TJ Maxx in the old world,

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:43.600
 all those places, what do you find? SNL. So this is the three things, small. Ask me, small.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:51.220
 Small means something that very limited attitude, limited intention. And that means when we

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.760
 practice,

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.710
 practice, if we start thinking, "Oh, I'm going to do this for myself. I'm going to make myself

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:58.480
 happy."

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.840
 For that, it feels quite good. It makes me happy. And therefore, I'm doing this practice. Kind of

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.000
 thinking of that, which is wonderful, which is good. But according to the teaching, that is named

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:20.680
 as an "S." That is "S." "S" practice. "S" practice. "F" with that, and not just only my "this" help

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.040
,

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.720
 only this lifetime, but I believe also next life. Therefore, I like to be kind of a little bit

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:33.360
 better. I like to become stronger, even better. Not just only this, next life, not just only that.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.200
 Even I like to leave this samsara, this is typically behind me. I just bother too much.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.400
 "F" is true. The Buddha teaching said the rebirth and all those things. I don't really like that to

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.480
 be reborn again and again and all these things. I like to leave behind everything and go somewhere,

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:57.040
 isolated places. And we have that attitude, and thinking, start thinking practices. That is

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:07.440
 initial as "M." "M" initial. "M" initial practices. And now, with those thoughts, with kind of this

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.520
 beautiful thought is helping the support is good, understand the meaning of that, not just myself,

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:20.320
 not just only thinking for the next future, what I will be. But I like to release, remove

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:26.880
 everyone's suffering, the difficulty to all living beings. And everyone in fact, I like to bring to

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:35.600
 the enlightened state, including myself. And having that big vision, big goal, big vastness thought

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.600
,

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:42.720
 and begin to practice, meditate, and develop both each other. What is that? That initial is "L."

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:50.160
 "L" practices. "L" practice. That. So therefore, both Mahayana practitioners, as we are already

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.600
 a practitioners, we should develop, re-stantin. I mean, it's not something that we don't have.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.000
 You already have. We already have that. But we should always glorify that.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.280
 Give you that. I'm going to bring everyone happy, everyone joy, everyone peace, and remove their

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:14.800
 suffering, the difficult, not just suffering is difficult, but cause of that, which makes suffering

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.800
,

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.560
 which makes it difficult, which makes it trouble. That cause worry, I like to remove. I like to

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.720
 clean. Really, I'm going to ask it. And then my something. Thinking of that and practice is known

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.880
 as then, the bodhicaka practices, vastness bodhicaka. Those are in the teaching, used to

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:40.480
 call "chivo-chungo" in the Tibet. "Chivo-chungo," "chivo-mrei," "chivo-chimbo." That means,

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:48.960
 the small person, I mean, effortlessly directly from the Tibet, as the teaching said. The small

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:56.880
 person, medium person, big person. Big person practices. And the small, it's small-minded.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.160
 Small kind of, it's not just a small mind in one way. It's good, but it's thinking just very

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:09.040
 localized, very personal, kind of localized thinking and doing the practices. And one second

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:16.720
 is little larger, little bigger, bigger, and I'm still thinking kind of one's own self there. And

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:23.870
 big person is then thinking of every living place. Their hearts are big as skies, wisdom's bigger

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:24.240
 and

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:32.720
 brighter as brilliant suns. And then, courage and commitments are stronger than regular

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:39.280
 mountains. Or make regular mountain of the mountain samaras. And moving forward with that steadfast

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:45.760
 thought and thinking of the beautiful goal, vision, moving forward. That is known as the bodhicaka

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:51.840
 practice, as we all know that we discussed. And with that attitude and keeping that in the heart

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:58.720
 and beautifully. And that is known as the first noble, the beginning noble, as His only dual

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:05.200
 music. See that is the beginning noble. With this noble practice, with that, with that power,

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.160
 and then we begin to meditate.
