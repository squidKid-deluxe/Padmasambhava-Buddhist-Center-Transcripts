00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.120
 And the other day, Song 7, and oh yeah, yeah, now this great master, great master Kiapua Toruran,

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:21.000
 introducing again pointing out the nature of the mind, the nature of the person of this mind.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.360
 This person's mind is, he is what is again a Dzogchen teaching, what's called?

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:34.360
 If you use Dzogchen teaching, Dzogchen is the complete nature of the mind's teachings,

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:40.360
 the nature of everything. In Dzogchen teaching, everything is in a three-kaya status.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:46.360
 Three-kaya, such as Dharmakaya, Sambokaya, and Dharmakaya status.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:52.360
 This three-kaya, not outside, it starts from within us.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:59.360
 This is, therefore, is called, inwardly inherited three-kaya naturals.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:06.360
 Because of inwardly three-kaya naturals, then we proceed externally to three-kaya-buddhas,

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.360
 such as the Buddha Sambokaya Buddha, the Buddha Vedyadara, the Buddha Sambokaya Buddha,

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.360
 as Dharmakaya Buddha, and the Vedyadara, as well as the Five Dhyan Buddhas,

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:23.360
 like Sambokaya Buddha, and Bhurakama Sambokaya Haryakyamuni, as Dharmakaya Buddha.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.360
 That's what we proceed with.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:32.360
 And so, with this understanding, now, this present our mind, right?

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.360
 My mind, your mind, is the nature of the three-kaya status, three-kaya status.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.360
 These are the nature of the three-kayas in the Tibetan world.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.360
 Maybe you ask, I will, this is a big topic here, too.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.360
 So, therefore, I will use the Tibetan world, too.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.360
 Moo, Rangi, Tukki.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:55.360
 Moo, if you like to write that, N-G-O-W-O, Moo.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:04.360
 And Rangi, R-A-N-G-C-H-I-N, or Z-H-I-N, Rangi.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:10.360
 And Tukki, T-H-U-G, and then J-E, Tukji.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:16.360
 So, these are the nature of the mind, our mind.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.360
 This is also known as three primordial vistas.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.360
 Three primordial vistas.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.360
 Primordial vista of the, if I used to be the word, primordial vista of the Moo,

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:35.360
 primordial vista of Rangi, and primordial vista of Tukki.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.360
 This is the inherited nature.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.360
 Other day we spoke what?

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.360
 The Buddha is residing right in our heart center.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.360
 All the youth provides body.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:51.360
 This youthful vast body, that Buddha, which is residing right in the center of our heart,

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.360
 is the essence of these three qualities.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:03.360
 These are, in a way, the wisdom nucleus, which is residing in our heart center.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.360
 These are primordial nuclear vistas.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:12.360
 Nuclear wisdom of the emptiness, nuclear nature, the wisdom of clarity,

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:19.360
 the natural wisdom of the energy arising, these three vistas.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:27.360
 These three vistas are the source of every display in the samsara.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:33.360
 And all, everything. This is the standard, these three wisdom is.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:41.360
 The ordinary wisdom is, for example, that what we see, the external poem, song, space,

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.360
 are also, according to Tukki Tukki, it developed from this, from this sense.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.360
 And the body, speech, mind come from this.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.360
 And everything, all these three realms of what the Buddha teaches us,

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.360
 also is a reflection of this.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:04.360
 This is the soul. Therefore, it is the soul of every display in the samsara.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:11.360
 And since it has that, then it is also embodiment of all the enlightened qualities,

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.360
 such as dharmakaya, sambhukaya, dharmakaya we talk about.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.360
 And the other day, we spoke with it, with five guys.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:24.360
 Five guys are the display of these three natures.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:31.360
 Three combined toga that nature is arising in the form of these three five guys.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:39.360
 Those five guys are dharmakaya, sambhukaya, narmakaya, enlightenment kaya,

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.360
 and indestructible kayas. Those are named.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.360
 What are those differences between these? There is nothing really much difference.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:55.360
 The enlightened kaya, the fourth kaya, can be sometimes translated as subhava kaya or dharmat kayas

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.360
.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:03.690
 But enlightened kaya, that means these three natures, Moo, Rangi, they are already enlightened

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:04.360
 status.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:10.360
 Bring up, high up that religion, bring up that qualities, it's called enlightened kayas.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.360
 Enlightened kaya or the Tibet, mukar, nain, chupa, ko, is.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.360
 And the fifth one, is indestructible kayas.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:29.360
 These natures, three natures or these kayas, can not be destroyed, cannot be divided.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:35.360
 It's all in the same states, same natures states, indestructible natures states.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.360
 Never change, never go bad or never things happen.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:47.360
 From the beginning times until now, when you got that realization, not just as natural as it is,

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:52.360
 when you got that realization, exactly as it is, this is called indestructible kayas.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:58.360
 So, those are the four kayas. And then, five Vasudams here.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:03.120
 Five Vasudams here, and that I think many of you know, but I will list again, it's coming in later

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.360
 to you,

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:10.360
 but maybe I talk here too, let's do it. And the five Vasudams are dharmadhatu Vasudams,

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:17.360
 and then meron-like Vasudams, econimity Vasudams,

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:25.360
 and all discrimination, evilness Vasudams, and all accomplishing Vasudams.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:31.360
 All accomplishing Vasudams. Those are five Vasudams.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:36.360
 Where this comes from? Again, it came from the same source.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:43.360
 From the nature, from the moral, rangi and the tukkins.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:49.360
 When I translate these three things into English, many times it's moral.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.360
 I translate it as natural, natural.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:59.360
 But they are really, it's just very similar in a way, the moral, rangi.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:10.400
 So, natural, more translated as natural, and rangi translated as clarity, I translate it, kind of

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.360
 slightly different.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:20.360
 Clarity, natural, and tukki translated many times, arise, sparking energy or compassion.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:26.150
 Those are, I translate it. But I think this great master explaining that nature, again, these three

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:26.360
 things,

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:31.360
 more in the head, head, so I won't go here, maybe here, there, there.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:36.360
 So, these three things, so these five Vasudams come from where?

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:42.360
 A children from all that things. But we say, particularly from kind of every lighted way,

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:47.360
 these five Vasudams are the clarity aspect of this nature.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:52.360
 What could, moral, rangi, tukki, we say.

00:07:52.360 --> 00:08:03.360
 So, these five Vasudams are sparking, lightening, lightening qualities of rangi, clarity.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:08.360
 This is the clarity aspect of the nature of the mind.

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:15.360
 Then, all the other Buddhas call it, everything, such as the five,

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:26.360
 all the Sambokaya call it, the Nama Kaya call it, all that is then, is completed within this Rupa.

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:32.360
 Within the, in the Rupa mobile, within the Rangi, within the tukki,

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:40.330
 or within the natural, emptiness natural, within the clarity natural, within the compassion natural

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:40.360
.

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:45.360
 All is completed within that, that.

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:48.360
 And now, then we continue this.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:53.360
 And therefore, so, when you, even though this Rupa,

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:59.360
 when all these five Vasudams are divided and it's kind of like make explanation, all these things,

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:03.360
 all these explanations, but when you look to the nature of the mind,

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:09.360
 or when you look to the opposite mind, that you find any of those columns,

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:15.360
 any of those discriminations, no, there's nothing really you find.

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:20.360
 Even you make this explanation, if you look inward to your Rupa,

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:25.360
 to your mind, nature of the mind, all is in the way evaporated.

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:33.360
 All is just a kind of like, when, beyond the conceptions.

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:40.360
 That aspect, again, our highlight of this great Master's truth, that aspect is emptiness.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:43.360
 That's called emptiness nature.

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:48.360
 You don't find anything, even if you make all these explanations, all that,

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:54.360
 but we try to find all those, each of those, in our mind, in our Rupa, our nature of the mind,

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:59.360
 there's nothing we can really pinpoint. Anything is all transcendent.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:06.360
 All went away, in a way. We reach the speechless states.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:12.360
 When you discover that nature, that is known as Dharmakaya natures.

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:17.360
 That is Dharmakaya. It's not something that we stuck there.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:21.360
 We discover Dharmakaya nature.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:26.360
 What would Dharmakaya say? What is Dharmakaya?

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:33.360
 Always in the teachings, beyond the conceptions, beyond the three times,

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:44.360
 beyond any levels, beyond any aspects, that is Dharmakaya, Dharmakaya.

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:48.360
 Now that Dharmakaya, we are not looking outside.

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:55.360
 We are discovering within our self, within your self, within my self.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:59.360
 How we discover, as the great Master says,

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:04.360
 when you make an explanation of all these minds, Dharmakaya, Dharmakaya,

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:10.360
 all these things, when you look inwardly, there is nothing you see,

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:14.360
 nothing substantial exists at all.

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:23.360
 That openness, that emptiness, that specialness, that vastness,

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:30.360
 that freedom is the nature of Dharmakaya,

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:34.360
 the nature of Dharmakaya of one's own nature of the mind.

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:41.360
 We discover that all. Now you discover that nature, nature.

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:49.360
 Now that Dharmakaya, Dharmakaya even is beyond all of those things.

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:57.360
 It is ready to arising, ready to arising as a display of the conception,

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:07.360
 in my usual conceptions, ready to arising, that energy before it is materialized

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:13.360
 as a conception, that energy, that vastness, clarity, that openness,

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:19.360
 that vividness is known as Sambukkaya. Here, great Master says,

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:26.360
 the self-luministic quality of the emptiness is Sambukkaya.

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:31.360
 That is Sambukkaya, that energy, that clarity, that.

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:34.360
 And what the great Master in the Dukti teaching said,

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:38.360
 when you discover the Dharmakaya nature and relax on the clarity,

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:42.360
 he says, trying to stay in the clarity aspect of that nature.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:49.360
 That means we bring up that with Dharmakaya and with Sambukkaya, Sambukkaya energy.

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:55.360
 We relax a little, bring more clarity energies, or clarity aspect.

00:12:55.360 --> 00:13:00.360
 Those poor reasons in the Dukti teaching, what he said,

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:05.360
 meditating with three immoguls, bring a little clarity.

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:11.360
 Not just kind of like most sinking on that emptiness, sink it in, bring more clarity.

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:19.360
 That means you bring the energy, vibrating energy and clarity in our meditation.

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:27.360
 And that is Sambukkaya, Sambukkaya and Dharmakaya's inseparable status, of course.

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:33.360
 So that is Sambukkaya. Again this is Sambukkaya, we are not talking outside.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:42.360
 This time, our own nature of the mind, the clay, the energy, energy, that clarity,

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:48.360
 that is clarity, that or the luminous to call it, is Sambukkaya, that.

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:54.360
 And because of these two, the openness of the Dharmakaya or emptiness of Dharmakaya,

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:59.360
 clarity, energy of that Sambukkaya in separable status,

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:08.360
 then what is arising, arising thoughts, if I use the word thoughts or consults,

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:12.360
 that is Dharmakaya.

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:22.360
 This Dharmakaya is also unblockable of the energy coming out.

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:28.360
 Unblockable energy cannot stop.

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:36.360
 That, anything can arise, anything without any restrictions or regulated,

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:46.360
 arises really, continuous, free flow, flows, call it, that in here, that is Narmakaya.

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:49.360
 That is Narmakaya Buddha.

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:56.360
 Now this Narmakaya Buddha, that free flowing energy towards the coming,

00:14:56.360 --> 00:15:05.360
 that nature is nature of the Dharmakaya, nature of Sambukkaya.

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:13.360
 That means that free flowing thought is empty, its clarity is sparkling.

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:18.360
 So that free flowing thought is embodiment of the three kyas.

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:25.360
 Therefore in the Dzogchi teaching, what is it, when you meditate, don't stop the thought.

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:29.360
 Don't permanent thought, don't try to beat this and that.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.360
 Let it come, let it go.

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:34.360
 Stay in that freedom status.

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:38.360
 But don't carry with the destructors.

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:41.360
 And don't label, don't follow the upper dakthas.

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:45.360
 When you follow that upper thought, we are labeling.

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:53.360
 We are, that means label, root of label is grasping, is clinging.

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:55.360
 Then we are deluded.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:16:00.360
 That deluded is what is called in the Dzogchi teaching, that is samsara.

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:04.360
 Then we are wandering the samsara again, wandering.

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:11.360
 Therefore, we bring a word that is coming forth, let it come, let it go.

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:15.360
 Are we able to stay in the prison state exactly as it is?

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:21.360
 Then there is nothing is bad, nothing is wrong.

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:24.360
 Everything is in the three kyas state.

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:26.360
 Everything is in the perfect state.

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:28.360
 All that for those reasons.

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:32.360
 And it is called Samad-Bhadar state.

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:38.360
 And for that reason, the great master Dungchima said, his dharma dhatu, treasures, what is it?

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:43.360
 Emptiness in Samad-Bhadara, appearance in Samad-Bhadara.

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:45.360
 And respectfully, Samad-Bhadara.

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:47.360
 Samsara is Samad-Bhadara.

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.360
 Narana is Samad-Bhadara.

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:54.360
 Everything is in Samad-Bhadar states or perfect, great, perfect states.

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:58.360
 This realization is not going to start from outside.

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:02.360
 This begins with these three kyas states.

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:07.360
 When abiding with these three kyas states, and all is in three kyas states.

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:12.360
 Therefore, it is all is Buddha Samad-Bhadar state.

00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:15.360
 Buddha Samad-Bhadara, what is it?

00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:19.360
 If we translate that into Indian, what means?

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:21.360
 Always good.

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:23.360
 Always good.

00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:26.360
 That's nothing is not good.

00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:28.360
 All good.

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:31.360
 This means all good.

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:38.360
 If we are abiding in the three kyas states as we discover, as we abide in these stages,

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:41.360
 all is good.

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:42.360
 All is good.

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:45.360
 As I said, yes now.

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:46.360
 Don't give a say.

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:47.360
 Narana good.

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:49.360
 Samsara is good.

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:52.360
 And everything is good.

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:57.360
 Everything in that context of the states.

00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:05.720
 Therefore, three kyas is, again, is very massive point that we are not going to discover that from

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:06.360
 outside.

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:08.360
 Looking and searching with effort.

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:17.360
 It is within us, we discover with effortless, naturally, very relaxed, peaceful.

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:19.360
 That's what we say.

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:25.360
 And to make that clear explanation,

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:28.360
 to make this clear explanation of what we use.
