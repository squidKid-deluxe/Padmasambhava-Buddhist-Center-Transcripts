00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.500
 First, I'm going to talk about the three introductions of the Guru Dragpo. Guru Dragpo is a shared

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.500
 emanation of Guru Padmasambha.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:17.000
 Who is Guru Padmasambha as you discussed yesterday, as we talked many times, as you know, but again

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:25.000
, to glorify of the quality and important and preciousness of Guru Padmasambha is always reward,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 always satisfied.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 Because it's a stretch to our nature, to our qualities, our identity, our truth, our destination,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.500
 and our goal and our aim. Therefore, it's so important.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:49.000
 Why is Guru Padmasambha in absolute level? Guru Padmasambha is no other than our true nature, true

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 nature of our mind.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.690
 When I speak in truth, what that literally means? Truth means it's not saturated or polluted by the

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.000
 dualities, not the habeit patterns.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 It's not the duality, not the idea, conception, thinking, that true of our self.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.920
 True nature of our self is open as a building sky, free from the clothes, sky that which is free

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:24.000
 from the sky, time that free from clothes, mist, dust, the building sky.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 That nature, the sky like mind is the nature of the Guru Padmasambha.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:39.970
 Guru Padmasambha is not just a partiality, they designated things or objects. It is true quality of

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:50.000
 the nature, the pervasive, the infinite, and the great openness, great freedom, and great emptiness

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:58.050
, the transcendent emptiness that allows all the beautiful qualities, beautiful varieties of what we

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.000
 want.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 We like to see, it's allowing that, that, that call, that openness.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 That pervasive openness is the great nature of the Guru Padmasambha.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:18.970
 Absolute nature of the Guru Padmasambha will be not just as I said, divided, discriminations, and

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.000
 partialities.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 It is pervasive nature. That nature is your nature. That nature is my nature.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 We have equally beautiful nature. That's why we are here in this world.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.110
 We are gathered here because of that beautiful nature. There's such aloneness, beautiful

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.000
 opportunities that it allows.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 That openness that is known as, in the Buddha's teaching, known as Dharmakaya is a great pervasive,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 the true body, true qualities, foundation of everything, foundation and ground of everything.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:13.440
 That is what you all have. I have. We all have. How wonderful. How beautiful. That is the Absolute

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.000
 Guru Padmasambha.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 So today, we are going to connect it to that Guru Padmasambha, that Absolute Guru Padmasambha.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.750
 Having this Absolute Guru Padmasambha, now we are going to also alloy the other beautiful qualities

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.000
, not going to be restricted by the dualities.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 We are going to alloy these beautiful qualities. The arising beautiful qualities openly,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:51.470
 predominantly, that is known as the poem displays, poem displays, displaying that we can go, we can

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:59.000
 think something, think and feel something, touch something.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 And that is known, as I said, poem bodies, poem kaiyas, or in a Sanskrit word, used as rupa kaiyas.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 It's something that we can imagine. Even the myths of the dualities, myths of the conceptions,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 myths of all these different kinds of, I didn't think, still we can feel that cause.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:32.100
 That call it is sign point of all the displays of everything what we go through and everything what

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.000
 others go through.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 And that is known as then, as first spirit is known as then. The sambhu kai, the very richness.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 Sambhu kai, the Sanskrit word, means the very richness treasure, the poem.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:56.620
 Richness means it has everything. In the samsara what you are experiencing, what we experience now,

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:03.000
 what we experience in the nirvana, all is come from that richness.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:14.280
 Our conception, our perceptions, our ideas, our thoughts, feelings, five aggregates, and beyond the

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:20.000
 five aggregates, everything comes from this richness.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:28.440
 Therefore, it is known as sambhu kai in Sanskrit, in the Tibetan is known as lumkyu zoku. That

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.000
 means every richness are complete.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 We are talking something richness that suffer level and as well as gross levels.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.220
 Without that openness, richness, the variety of this what we are seeing, perceiving, or what we are

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.000
 perceiving, is nothing going to happen.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 That means there is aloiness of the richness behind our duality scenes.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 There is a deep perform, richness is always open, always ready.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:12.970
 That richness is this time, we are going to highlight as great compassion, great wisdom, great

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:15.000
 compassion and great wisdom.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:23.040
 That all commercials, every richness is now starting point as great compassion, great wisdom

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.000
 combined together.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 Wisdom is not right side and compassion is not left side. Both are both places.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:42.970
 Both are inseparable, compassion and wisdom. It perverts in nature as sun hits the light in the

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.000
 morning in the sky.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 That is the arising point of the great display, the active display.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:00.160
 Because when we see the great light in the blue sky, the clear way of all the darkness, the

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.000
 building of light,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 what we are going to see behind after 15 minutes or 20 minutes, the brilliant sun is coming.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 That great light is light of love, light of compassion, light of wisdom.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 This love and compassion wisdom is not Asiatic, not designated as I said, infinite, pervasive.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:38.380
 Our compassion, your compassion, your wisdom is pervasive to everywhere, without the borders of the

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:42.000
 directions and without the borders of the times.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 It's going beyond the time and the space and areas or places.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:58.000
 That is known as Sambokai, that richness, that pervasive, that massive calling of that.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:06.090
 That richness that this beautiful God is going to touch to every single living being, every being,

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:09.000
 the whole universe, whole environment,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:21.830
 whole galaxy and whole cosmos become the mandala or the circle of compassion and wisdom, insepar

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:23.000
able.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 How wonderful, how beautiful. When you think that, how beautiful, how special, how rewarding.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 This nature I'm not talking outside Sambokai. This is your nature, this is my nature.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.540
 This is not just I'm talking, that's what the Buddha taught. That's what the Guru Pima Sambokai

00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:44.000
 taught.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 That's what all those great monks taught and practiced and actualized.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:56.500
 That great pervasive nature of the perfect quality is the Sambokai quality of the Guru Pima Sambok

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:57.000
ai.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:04.400
 That is Sambokai. When you have the true love and a competing anniversary in your heart, without

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:07.000
 the discrimination,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:14.060
 we are within the Sambokai state of the Guru Pima Sambokai, within the absolute state of the Guru P

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:15.000
ima Sambokai.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:24.260
 What it does, it will remove all the unnecessary emotions and habit pattern that is disturbing us

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.000
 for lifetimes

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 and disturbing them to old others in lifetimes. It is truly, we are touching the treasure.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:41.950
 We are reverting the treasure. We open the treasure box. That is known as Sambokai of the Guru Pima

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:43.000
 Sambokai.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:50.190
 Today we are going to revert that quality, that ignited quality of the richness of your Sambokai of

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:52.000
 the Guru Pima Sambokai.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 My Sambokai of the Guru Pima Sambokai. We are going to open the treasure box.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:03.590
 From that active energy of the sun, the brilliant sunlight in the sky, the union of the competitive

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:04.000
 wisdom,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:10.000
 then the next power is coming. That is known as Nirmaka.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 The emanation of poem, manifestation of poem, flexible poem, not restricted by the habit patterns,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 as it needed. That is known as Nirmaka in Sanskrit word, in Tibet is known as Trupakur.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000
 And I am translating that into English as emanation.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 Emanation is not just one restricted, again, thing, few goals, few deeds in there.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:48.000
 Emanation is the emanation of the true love and compassion and wisdom, what we talk.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 That actively now came in the poem that we can see by eye, by ear and by all, by our five senses.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:07.000
 Eye senses, ear senses, nose senses, tongue senses and body senses.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:19.690
 In the mind, feel the mind, by the mind. That is the active, powerful poem of union of compassion

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:21.000
 and wisdom.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 And that can be a very many different poems, as I said, without any restrictions.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:33.400
 This time we are going to see this active Guru Pima Sambokai, an emanation as then known as Bhema

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:34.000
 Hill.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:42.000
 In the debate, he is known as Bhema Tham, or wrathful of lotus, wrathful of lotus.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:48.000
 When you think of wrathful lotus, that tells us how tenderness is behind.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:54.000
 Even though he is appeared as very peaceful, that which frightening, we are going to shatter,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:00.160
 we are going to alienate with our ego clinging to duality, but he is so tender, so gentle, so

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.000
 soothing, so mellow.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:15.000
 So mellow as lotus, as lotus. That is the wrath of Guru Pima Sambokai.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:24.970
 Today we are going to see that mellow, that beauty, that calm and peaceful, that gentle, as

00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:28.000
 appeared as poem of wrath.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:34.630
 This wrath, why is it coming? There are many different reasons, I am going to talk those things

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:35.000
 later.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.880
 Tomorrow in the day I pray we will have great opportunity to be together, discussing the teaching

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:45.000
 of the Buddha and Guru Pima Sambokai, exploring our nature.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000
 One after another, unfolding, we are going to discover, so I am going to talk those things.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 But, principally, wrath purpose is true. Shattering, shuttling, right?

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:05.000
 Shattering, shuttling of our duality, our ego clinging.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
 When you think of the ego clinging duality, how about that?

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:19.880
 If we look to ourselves, ego clinging duality, we always like to see the ego's legs, the duality's

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:21.000
 legs.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 Not necessarily it is good for us, that we know.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 Just like the ego's legs, the duality's legs, we do that even we know that it is not good.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 In a way, we have put the blindfold in our eye, and jumping in the cliffs.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 Today, we are shuttling that habit, that habit better.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 This is what is known as wrath.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.540
 There is all the Buddha's image, and all the Buddhism of the Sambokai is the same purpose, same

00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:57.000
 things.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:05.000
 But why wrath? Because wrath is, often can anybody hear what you say?

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:12.090
 It is, like us, when you have the treatment, when we go through the treatment, remove the disease,

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:13.000
 or to take care of it.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 First we go out, sometimes we help those spots.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:25.000
 We do the detoxification, and then we do some medicine, so all the things.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 After the treatment is cured completely, then finally we go to the Surgeon General's office.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:41.440
 Surgeon General's office will first analyze everything, and then that Surgeon General, whether he

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:46.000
 or she or he, is going to take care of our two stubbles.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:57.890
 So, this wrath is the Surgeon General's office, of true clarity, our wrath, stubborn, habit

00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:02.000
 preparedness, wrath, wrath and habit preparedness.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 Therefore, this is so special.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 This is one of the great methods of the Vedayana Teachings.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:18.470
 Vedayana teaching the esoteric Buddhism has richness of the skillful means that can apply to the

00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:25.610
 different aspects of our emotions and habit patterns, and cleansing, and the pore fire, and

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:28.000
 transform, doesn't it?

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 That's known as Vedayana.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 It's a diamond part.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
 It's a shortcut.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 Diamond part is quicker, smooth, easy, but you have to call it locations.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
 You have to qualify it.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 For example, you all know, when we go to the in a traffic light, or the traffic game, if there is a

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
 diamond part, that, what's it called?

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 Diamond lines.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
 You have to be qualified.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
 You know that.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 If you have to qualify, you can go smooth.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:10.130
 The head of every other, those jammed ones, those who are swept, swept, swept, swept, and all this

00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:12.000
 funny things going on.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
 But you're just riding, so nice and cool.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 You become the cool guys, the cool girls.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.910
 Just the head of that, because you're qualified, you don't have to fear that they're going to

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:25.000
 interrupt it and give the tickets.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.000
 Tickets.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 You're qualified.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:33.320
 Similarly, Vedayana, when you have the qualifications, with the qualification of the Vedayana

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:41.000
 practices, is courage and commitment, joy and devotion.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 Devotions, when you have that, you are qualified.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
 We are qualified because it's our treasure.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 Our richness will recapture our richness.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000
 We are truly qualified because it's our aim, our inheritance.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
 Therefore, we are qualified.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.550
 That reason, that in that sense, or that understanding, then we are going to receive the

00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:11.000
 empowerment of the Gurutaka,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 the wrath of emanation, or the Pemaheraka, or wrath of the Lord of Students.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 That is there.
