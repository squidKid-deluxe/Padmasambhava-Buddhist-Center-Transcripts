NOTE     "synopsis": "Brief Teaching and Practice on the Dudjom Tersar Ngondro\nwith Lama Dragpa and Lama Laia\n\nSaturday, April 16, 2022\nPadma Samye Ling\n\n--\n\nWe specifically discuss the Inner Tantras Mahayoga techniques of the \u201c3 Samadhis,\u201d as well as the three qualities we always have to incorporate in our Vajrayana visualization practice: (1) clarity, (2) purity, and (3) stability.\n\nHere are some thoughts I wrote to reflect on:\n\nAccording to certain Nyingma lineage pith instructions for practicing the Union of Creation and Completion Stages, there are 3 key points that have to be simultaneously performed and verified in one\u2019s personal experience for one\u2019s practice to be \u201cauthentic,\u201d or to bring swift results: (1) clarity (salwa), (2) purity (dagpa), and (3) stability or fearlessness (tanpa).\n\nTo some degree, these 3 points correlate with framing emptiness as simultaneously being a quality, \u201csubstance,\u201d and nonconceptual awareness. If these aren\u2019t simultaneously enacted (due to mastery), at least none of them can be conceptually omitted without reducing the 3-D complexity of emptiness into 2-D or 1-D over-simplifications that omit big, vital chucks of Dharma and distort fundamental contributions of the Nyingma practice lineage of the Inner Tantras.\n\n1. Clarity: intricate particulars of one\u2019s visualization (representation) of substantial features of the container and the contained (the apparent \u201cthe world\u201d such as bodies, environment, and oneself) which gradually becomes a direct seeing of pure relative truth as one\u2019s concepts become more accurate, and eventually included within a larger scope of post-conceptual wisdom awareness that allows subject-object duality to arise, but without reifying appearances into exclusive binaries, but rather accommodates them as inclusive polarities that are integrated from this \u201chigher,\u201d more comprehensive \u201cwisdom\u201d awareness.\n\n2. Purity: the quality of lacking inherent true existence (quality), or alternatively, abiding in nonconceptual wisdom awareness that doesn\u2019t reify experience even as it allows percepts and concepts to emerge (as wisdom display, or tsal)\n\n3. Stability: Unwavering conviction or certainty wisdom that stably, one-pointedly remains in nonconceptual wisdom with \u201cvajra pride\u201d without attaching to or avoiding the natural arising energy of the nature of mind.\n\nSo in a way, from the Inner Tantric practice that eventually leads to direct yogic perception (or the fourth time, which always already includes these 3 other performances of emptiness) . . .\n\nClarity: emptiness as apparent \u201csubstance\u201d or \u201cground\u201d\n\nPurity: as the pure quality of this groundless ground when it\u2019s not reified\n\nStability: abiding in non-reifying, conceptual awareness that still allows for all the other accurate ways of mind to function, while it also clearly knows that deluded, distorted, fixated ways the mind functions having been there and done that, without presently needing to collapse into that mode presently.\n\nSimply put, we experience everything (the world; the ground) as pure display (emptiness-appearance; groundless) with nonconceptual wisdom (emptiness-awareness; unframed).\n\nThis means \u201cit\u2019s all always already transcendental wisdom rainbow body,\u201d yet allows plenty of (conceptual and experiential) space for mistaken nightmares of samsaric vision to happen throughout sentient interpretations of time and space.\n\nJust a few very quick thoughts in case they spark anything interesting.\n\ndragpa\n\n--\n\nAs an offering to interested Sangha members, Ven. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche has requested that Saturday Ngondro sessions with Lama Laia and Lama Dragpa be webcast.\n\nFor those who wish to join, instructions will be given on the essential points of the Dudjom Tersar Ngondro foundational practices, their vital importance within Tibetan Buddhism, as well as instructions for each section, including Refuge, Bodhichitta, Mandala, Vajrasattva practice, and Guru Yoga.\n\nThe essential meaning of this practice is that the Tibetan Buddhist foundational practices of Ngondro embody all the teachings of the Buddha. They are a perfect and complete framework for cultivating a balanced, effective, and rewarding spiritual practice.We\u2019ll also get to practice the entire Ngondro every session!\n\nLearn More:\n\nIn \"Illuminating the Path,\" Venerable Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche and Venerable Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche give clear and profound explanations on how to practice the path of Ngondro \u2013 the foundational set of practices of Tibetan Buddhism. This book includes line-by-line commentary on the concise Dudjom Tersar Ngondro revealed by His Holiness Dudjom Rinpoche, detailed instructions on how to practice, and helpful visual illustrations. It is both deep and accessible pointing out how we can see our fundamentally enlightened nature.\n\nwww.padmasambhava.org",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.560
 Warm greetings, friends. Warm greetings. Hello. Wow. We made it. So we're back. I celebrate

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:25.000
 that. I'm glad you're joining us. I'm glad everyone here is here. Thank you all. As we

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.200
 usually do, according to the lineage instructions and our precious, kind teachers, Venerable

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:36.760
 Kamparimachas, we'll begin by first turning our minds towards the Dharma. So,

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:43.620
 reactivate that just gratefulness and that fresh, connected awareness to all

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.720
 these amazing things we have going on for ourselves, all the conditions in our

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:54.800
 favor, including our body, families, friends, air, earth, teachings, the

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.280
 lineage. There's so many things we have to be thankful for in so many ways, so we

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.320
 really kind of reconnect and bring this to the front, like brightly kind of

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.640
 encourage this and just let this kind of fill your mind and your heart. So that's

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:15.080
 this joy and appreciation or renunciation renouncing all the ways we

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.800
 kind of get stuck and shut down. So we just put that aside for a moment and

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.360
 kind of brighten, and then that immediately leads to wanting all beings

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.840
 to brighten and to feel relieved and relaxed and refreshed and free and happy

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.320
 and grateful to soar in their own nature. So this is bodhicitta, the heart, mind of

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.240
 enlightenment. We all have this as our natural condition, this loving, kind,

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:46.920
 compassionate, inclusive, flexible, wise, tuned in, sensitive, responsive nature we

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.160
 have. This bodhicitta, our Buddha nature, mature nature of ourselves and of all

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:59.200
 beings. So we all have this, so we want that nature to fully be what it is and

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.160
 kind of just embody and embrace its own natural potential and elegance and to

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.300
 manifest everything it could possibly be right now. So that's bodhicitta, and when

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.080
 bodhicitta manifests fully, it naturally leads into pure perception, not just a

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.200
 prison of samsaric existence and struggle and suffering and wondering, but

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.520
 actually a delightful, enchanted experience of what it's like when

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.240
 kindness prevails, when the dharma prevails, when the ten virtuous qualities

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:35.300
 prevail, then this refinement, this bodhicitta kind of nature is allowed to

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.320
 fully course through our doors of perception and our communication, our

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.320
 environment, ourselves, ourselves, and so this pure perception, devotion, the

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.400
 connectedness, the trust that this goodness is inside, and it's inside all

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:56.540
 of us, and it's the very open, flexible fabric of reality. So we kind of turn all

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.880
 of these things on, turn the mind towards the dharma, brighten our bodhicitta,

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.040
 include all beings, and then see the goodness of everything and that

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.440
 opportunity that's already right here with us now. So we'll just flash that on

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.720
 now.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:40.600
. What an amazing opportunity. So thank you all so much. Again, the title

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.000
 of this topic, kind of this like little corner of reality, we're going to

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.800
 contemplate briefly before going into the Dhujm Terasarnandra practice. It's

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:55.700
 called creation and completion, dissolving rigidity to discover and

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:02.920
 co-create worlds of enlightened activity. Creation and completion, dissolving

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:10.580
 rigidity to discover and co-create worlds of enlightened activity. So we're

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:16.680
 jumping right into the big, big, big, vast, profound Vajrayana view, which is what

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.920
 we're doing every time with our nundra practice. And so we're going to just kind

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:27.080
 of, in one way, step back and appreciate all these amazing qualities of our

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.760
 minds, of the lineage, the lineage blessings, the teachings we've received,

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:36.720
 and really connect to these innate, extraordinary qualities we have to

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:44.000
 actually create and co-create and dissolve and release. And this is

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.880
 specifically a Vajrayana set of techniques, but I think it's really

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.960
 important to remember this isn't a Buddhist thing or a Vajrayana thing in

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:59.280
 particular. We're constantly imagining our life. So our eyes open, our ears open,

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:06.960
 our sense doors open, and they don't just meet some pre-given reality. They shape

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:14.240
 what is happening. So we have this entire vast arena of sensory perception that

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:20.040
 we can connect with and pay attention to or omit and distort, and literally it's

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:25.200
 how our minds and bodies work all the time. So if we were totally aware of all

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:31.320
 the sensory stimuli all the time, we would basically explode, because we're

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:36.880
 not ready for that. This human vehicle I have is not ready to highlight everything

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:43.040
 accurately. It can't. It can't now. I'm not ready for that. So I highlight certain

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:49.520
 features of what my experience is, and I imagine and fill in all kinds of gaps. So

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:55.160
 I like certain colors. I like certain shapes. I have a history of being scared

00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:00.200
 of certain noises. I like when someone says my name, especially when it like

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:05.640
 sounds like nice. I don't like it so much when they say my name with like kind of

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:11.120
 not so much nice sounding tone. This is just, I'm imagining. I'm like

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.840
 totally choosing, picking and choosing the ways that this reality seems to just

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.760
 be there. I'm selecting for all of this, and largely I don't know that I'm doing

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:26.520
 this. It's unconscious. All these habit patterns I have to prefer this and avoid

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:34.720
 that. Favor this, not favor that. This is a habitual mind, duality mind, and it's

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:39.040
 just through and through. My body's used to doing it. My mind's used to doing it,

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:43.880
 and I've done it so much that it just seems given like what my experience is.

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:51.680
 This room. Who's in this room? What is happening here? How do I make sense of it?

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:56.440
 I mean this is a very selective process. I am not tuned into all the patterns of

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:02.000
 independence, interdependence happening now. In this little corner of the world,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:10.440
 on planet Earth, amidst all these planets, this vast field of interdependence, this

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:15.560
 like very selective tiny little slice that is highly distorted, according to my

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:22.240
 own sense doors. And yet it all coheres. It comes together as if it's given. This

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:29.880
 seamless, given self-evident, this room is still here. My voice sounds similar. My

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:38.720
 train of memories lines up in some kind of a story. Gravity goes down, pulls down.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:47.160
 These patterns just keep happening. So the point here is, is they're not just

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:53.620
 out there. They're very much shaped by in here. So we're co, I'm co-shaping. I'm being

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:59.200
 shaped by my environment, and I'm shaping it. This is interdependence. I'm being

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:07.880
 affected by it, and I'm affecting it. Push and pull, come and go, up and down. And so

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:11.320
 then the question for me is, how much am I including what's actually helpful for

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:15.360
 me? How much am I actually like paying attention to the details that like

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:22.500
 activate my joy and appreciation? To like awaken my bodhicitta? To like really see

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:27.680
 more of a vast spectrum of the more subtle interdependence in the vast

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:32.760
 arena of interdependence. How much am I doing that? And that's a big part of us

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:39.400
 as Dharma practitioners. How much am I doing that? That's a very personal

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:44.440
 question, and it's important we keep asking that. Because if we don't have a

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:49.000
 flexible sense of me and a flexible sense of you and a flexible sense of us

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.360
 in this world, in the environment, if we really just think this is all just this

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:58.680
 way. There's no room to grow. There's no room to transform. There's no room to

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:05.880
 liberate. It's just stuck. Very rigid. And this is largely a function of my own

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:09.960
 mind, habitual mind. I'm not really paying attention and tuning in

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:18.280
 sufficiently when I'm in this state. Same old, same old, same old. Me, me, me, me. I'm

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:23.560
 just little old me. You're just little old you. And then eventually something

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:30.200
 stops. And then we have suffering. This is a little, little slice. So the Buddha said

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:36.000
 there's such a bigger way to open these doors, the sense doors. And the first step

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:42.080
 towards this vast Vajrayana view is recognizing that I do this. I'm all the

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:45.280
 time shaping my reality and my experience of what I see, what I

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:49.840
 interpret, how I make sense of it, how I then engage it. This is an ongoing

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:55.240
 visualization practice that I'm doing every single second. So my mind can do it.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:59.620
 Then it's the question of how well am I doing it? How much of the nature am I

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:05.560
 including? And then the additional step, once I take a little responsibility for

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:10.800
 wow, I'm really changing. I'm really shaping. I'm really selectively choosing

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:15.240
 and rejecting so much stuff all the time. I'm doing this. My mind's doing this.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:20.680
 Once I say hey, I can, if I'm doing this, then I can do this better. That's called

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:27.860
 responsibility that includes more freedom. And the beautiful next step is

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:34.600
 if I'm doing this, then if you're a sentient being, you are too. And the

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:40.520
 beauty of that is then I can tune in to your way of doing that more accurately

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:48.360
 so that when you and I interact, it's more mutually beneficial, more mutually

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:54.360
 uplifting. We both turn more towards the Dharma. This is called bodhisattva

00:10:54.360 --> 00:11:00.040
 activity. What's going on for you and your sphere and your arena and your

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:05.480
 history and your kind of, although the woes and the triumphs and the victories

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:11.640
 and the little quiet, everything's, you know, that make you feel like you. Because

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:15.120
 I know some to agree what's going on inside of me a little bit. I'm so

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:19.520
 unconscious of most of it. But the bodhisattva move is then, wow, if I'm

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:23.840
 imagining shaping so much of this all the time and if you're a sentient being,

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:29.520
 you are too, then how can we really co-create, not just be in an arena where I

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:35.840
 shape the arena, but be with other people, be with other friends. And then we team

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:43.080
 up and we pool our resources and we kind of line up with what's available for

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:49.040
 each other. And then we can have such a power, this is called sangha, right? The

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:52.760
 sangha of all sentient beings, then all Buddhists and all of Adriana Buddhists

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:55.840
 and those in the mandala that have received his instructions and the

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:59.880
 teacher at the same time. The bigger mandala is all sentient beings, that's

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:05.160
 the big sangha. So what a bodhisattva is trying to do, when this bodhicitta

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:10.280
 activates, is we're trying to tune in to other beings. What's happening with you?

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:14.200
 What's your story? What are your beautiful things? Where do you need help

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:18.640
 and support? And just to be available, to accommodate, right? That is always taught.

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:22.680
 The Buddha always met the readiness, dispositions and capabilities of sentient

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:27.280
 beings. Then a Buddha, just like a mirror, reflected what was appropriate and

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:31.800
 helpful in that context for those beings and their habits. And that was that

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:36.720
 meeting of that person's imaginal sphere, landscape, their relevance realization,

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:41.840
 and the salient features, the way they populate their world. The Buddha said,

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:48.000
 "Okay, given this game you're playing, this is the most optimal way of holding

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:54.200
 that game. To make it omni-win. As many beings can win." Then the Buddha just saw

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:57.120
 that point, because interdependence is there. The Buddha could see

00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:01.280
 interdependence clearly without distortion. Bing! This is the point that's

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:07.160
 most optimal, with all the kind of moving parts. And then the Buddha released. It's

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:13.600
 just a dream. And then let the dream's own natural intelligence auto correct itself.

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:20.920
 Auto enhance. Self-knowing can come out. So with the right support, this

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:26.160
 accommodating sensitivity, the Buddha would tune in. Bing! Hit just the right

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:30.540
 spot. That's called a pith instruction. And then the system itself, the mind, the

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:35.920
 body, the heart, the connectedness of that being, would start to fill itself out

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:40.880
 more fully. Its own Buddha nature would start shining. So it had its own internal

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:47.360
 integrity and power to then let its creative natural vitality and energy

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:54.560
 fill in its world more fully. This is bodhicitta in action. This is the Buddhist

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:59.880
 path. This is a six-part-mitra activity. This is more of like a cognitive

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:04.740
 science kind of talking about it. But this is kind of part one way of talking

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:08.600
 about this. It is very much lined up with Dharma, my small little understanding of

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:14.640
 Dharma. So then now we have this bodhicitta. I'm taking responsibility. I'm

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:19.060
 shaping these things. I want to shape it better, more fun, more inclusive, more

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:24.500
 flexible, more of the nature, more of relationality. So we meditate, see an

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:28.520
 object. I'm not the object. I see the object. Then we see two objects. Then we

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:32.200
 see three, four, five. Then all of a sudden we're aware of interdependence. And we're

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:35.720
 kind of then we get to have the power to choose which part we want to engage with.

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:39.840
 And the more we can do that, the more freedom we have, the more personal power

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:44.720
 we have, then all of a sudden you're doing it too. Then we can start to co-create

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:50.000
 stuff together. This is starting to become a very self-aware mandala. And

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.280
 then all we have all these lineage instructions and these living noble

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:57.040
 beings who like that's their response. That's all they do. That's their

00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:02.680
 responsibility. We say please help me and they say yes I will. And they're way

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:07.240
 past me. They're way past most sentient beings. I mean all sentient beings. But

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:11.080
 they're so advanced. They see so much of relative truth and they see the nature of

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:15.880
 all of it. And all they're doing is trying to optimize here, there, everywhere.

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:20.920
 Constantly, according to what helps. What helps on the ground, in the context. That

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:26.020
 they didn't create the context. My mind created the context. They just hit the

00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:31.060
 really little pivotal point and then let my mind and my heart start to

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:35.980
 do its own, its own natural intelligence can come out. They give us, they have that

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:42.940
 amazing kind of gentleness, Sheila, ethics, to tune into us and then like

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:48.600
 really optimize the inside, the outside. And we start getting this own

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:54.320
 intelligence, kind of awakens more further. And then we start having a

00:15:54.320 --> 00:16:01.120
 much more inclusive, expansive way of being, of making sense. We're less

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:06.400
 selective. Less my way or the highway. More, oh what's going on? A little more

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:14.780
 curious. More open exploration. And it's definitely more self-empowered. And that's

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:18.360
 a beautiful thing. So then that kind of lays the ground for us to get into and

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:27.280
 talk about this Vajrayana techniques a little bit. So this Vajrayana technique

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:32.040
 specifically is going to go over quickly this three samadhi's in Maha Yoga. It's

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:36.400
 the inner tantra view. This dudram tarasara practice is an inner tantra

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:44.600
 practice. Maha Yoga, Anu Yoga, Ati Yoga. And these commentaries we have from our

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:50.160
 precious teachers and as only as Dudram Rinpoche, they're exquisite. Everything's

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:56.040
 there. And so here we're just really like, by even talking about them, referring to

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:59.400
 them, it's like a direct blessing. We open the channel to receive the blessing and

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:05.800
 the power, the support. To let ourselves think bigger. Let ourselves feel

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:11.320
 more fully. And to not have it cram into the tiny little box of egoic me. But to

00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:16.200
 have it course through a more open free-flow experience of self and other.

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:23.760
 Because let our bodhicitta open. Let our rigidity relax. Let this tight fist

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:29.560
 of grasping the ice ball of fixation. Let it melt. And then the blessings can just

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:34.960
 pour through and do what they do. The interconnectivity of reality can just do

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:38.800
 what it does. It already knows what to do. We're just

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:42.440
 locking onto a piece of it and then we kind of let itself rip us around, you

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:48.080
 know. We tie this part of it, tie that part of it, tie that part. And then it

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:50.880
 keeps moving because it's interdependence and then we kind of get

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:58.880
 stretched and like have some sara. So this practice, we are really trying to

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:09.440
 stretch in a very conscious, very sensitive, gentle, courageous, tuned-in way. We're

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:17.540
 not trying to rip anything open. That's called a whatever. When something gets

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:22.880
 ripped out, isn't that like extractive? You just take the piece you want and leave

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:28.040
 everything else so they can wasteland. We're good at that. That's not what

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:34.000
 Dharma is telling us we need to do. We need to little stretch a little bit. Think

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.680
 a little bigger. Feel a little more fully. Accommodate someone else a little more.

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:44.600
 Then we can gradually, organically, kind of let this whole co-created reality

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:49.840
 we're sharing of the world and the contents, container and contained. We

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:53.280
 optimize it more. And then eventually it's just doing what it's doing already.

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:58.560
 So eventually we just stop interrupting it. We stop disrupting it and we go with

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:06.400
 the flow. And then we can just celebrate and enjoy. Then we can actually be real

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:11.320
 benefit here for in this tiny little finite time we have as human beings with

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:16.200
 these bodies that get old and our minds that end up usually mainly get fuzzy and

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:21.640
 confused. And so we can use this little window while we have that so much on our

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:28.200
 side to generate more kindness, more appreciation for others and to really

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:33.640
 like creatively create these spaces, these mandalas or just the Buddha nature

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:39.360
 just starts popping on. And everyone's relieved. Wow finally I'm not this bad

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:44.880
 person and all the guilt and all the everything you know. Bad me. We can just

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:50.640
 relax and be like wow it's good me. This is good you. We're awesome. Let's do all

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:57.360
 this awesome stuff together. This is getting into a Vajrayana view. This is

00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:01.040
 assumed in Vajrayana view and so we have to do the work to be able to get there

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:07.200
 too. That takes a lot of conscious energetic work to really like get you

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:10.720
 have that level of bravery and then to stretch just the right amount not too

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:17.000
 much not too little that Goldilocks amount. Just enough so we have to show

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.920
 up you know you get a little pressure to show up turn on brighten and then it's

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:26.600
 kind of oh what's gonna happen here then you have to lean in and pay attention

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:32.660
 it's not so big all at once so it's like and it's not so boring there's no

00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:36.760
 stress no pressure so it's just the same old habits you know. So it's not hell

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:41.360
 realm too much pressure it's not every everything's easy luxury cruise liner

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:48.800
 God realm land of opportunity the human realm just enough suffering but it's not

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:53.460
 excruciating all the time and then we can actually show up and turn on it's a big

00:20:53.460 --> 00:21:00.320
 part of the fortunate human birth just the right amount of pressure and we can

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:04.200
 actually intentionally try to do that in a more accelerated way where we grow

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:10.040
 faster open more let more of our Buddha nature kind of inform how we're you know

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:17.760
 creating things. So that's foundation and then there's three natures it's always

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:22.580
 I have two books here the one is Venerable Kemperumice's essential journey of life

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:28.340
 and death volume one. Everything we're looking at here they're all these

00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:33.080
 instructions are in this book if you if I was on a desert island I would want

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:37.360
 more than one book but this would definitely be in the backpack. If I had a

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:41.160
 kindle you know and like some infinite way to plug in to the island to have

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:47.760
 infinite power I'd probably fly away from the island but if I couldn't this

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:50.920
 would be one of the books essential journey in life and death volume one. And

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:58.560
 then secondly this is a commentary on Karma Chagme Ragaase the union of Mahamudran

00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:03.400
 Zogchen Venerable Kemperumice gave a month long of teachings on this text

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:10.880
 2011 at PSL and this is like really pithy instructions on a lot of things but one

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:14.740
 of them is the union of creation and completion stages this Vajrayana

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:20.600
 practice how to really bravely create enlightened worlds of enlightened

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:26.040
 activity how to actually relax and see that's already really happening here

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:30.920
 right now and if I just open the way I'm landscaping and terraforming everything

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:35.240
 I'll start to see all this stuff I didn't see before just like all of a

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:40.080
 sudden you get a higher caliber of kind of microscope or telescope nothing new

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:44.120
 popped in all of a sudden I could see things a little newly a little more

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:48.680
 clearly but then always I'm on the other side of the telescope so I'm selectively

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:53.040
 seeing pieces of it so I really am co-creating it's not just some given

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:58.360
 place out there it's much more interactive than that. So this true

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:06.040
 nature this is here we'll go into the three three samadhi's, they've

00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:10.720
 mentioned this so many times this is the bedrock of Vajrayana visualization and

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:15.540
 perfection practices creation and completion so there's two ways to do

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:20.880
 creation and completion one is you build the mandala and you build optimal

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:26.020
 basically an optimal universe for enlightened activity to happen and then

00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:33.160
 you relax and you let the activity happen that's called a gradual so you

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:38.560
 have a you have like a seed syllable become a symbol become a deity become a

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:41.880
 deity with hand implements become a deity with a retinue become a retinue

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:47.400
 that extends with a protection boundary that pushes out all disruption and then

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:52.120
 it gradually becomes like only a world of enlightened harmonious love compassion

00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:58.280
 and wisdom activity a living Buddha mandala and then we just rest and let

00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:04.040
 the mandala do the mandala activity and we can make offerings in the mandala

00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:07.400
 receive blessings in the mandala and then the deities bless us and they bless

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:10.600
 everything and purify everything it naturally transforms into its nature

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:14.040
 everything becomes spontaneous expression of deity mantra and dharmakaya

00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:19.680
 and then we rest and just let it do what it does so the resting parts the

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:25.200
 completion stage practice dissolution we release the grasping onto any kind of

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:32.640
 imaginal anything and we just let that very open perspective inform us with its

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:38.480
 natural wisdom display that's called a gradual creation and completion and this

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:43.000
 book this is quintessence of union of Mahamudra and Zogchen this is with

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.960
 commentary by Kimbal Kartar Rinpoche the former abbot of KTD Karmatriyana

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:53.080
 Dharmachakra so this book and by Ragaase I'll just read from the end and the root

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:58.320
 verse this is song 5 this is talking about the essence of the creation and

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:03.320
 completion stages which is the topic so here we are in the Vajrayana you know

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:22.460
 version of this topic page 250 song 5 the root meaning the path of generation and

00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:30.280
 completions union this has what has to be known and what has to be meditated the

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:34.720
 essence of the mind of all beings is primordially the essence of Buddhahood

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:40.280
 its empty essence is the birthless dharmakaya it's clear distinct

00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:45.760
 appearances are the Sambhogakaya it's unceasing compassion is the variegated

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:53.440
 nirmanakaya the inseparable union of those three is the Sava Bhikka Kaya its

00:25:53.440 --> 00:26:01.280
 eternal changelessness is the Maha Suka Kaya this is Ragaase this primordial

00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:05.080
 innate presence in yourself was not created by the compassion of the Buddhas

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:10.040
 by the blessings of the gurus or by the profound special essentials of the Dharma

00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:16.120
 wisdom has primordially been present in this way all the sutras and tantras are

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:22.960
 in accord on this then why are we wandering in samsara we do this because

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:28.760
 of the delusion of not knowing ourselves for example we are like a man who has

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:34.760
 gold hearthstones but does not know they are gold and suffers from starvation but

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:40.680
 given the direct recognition of this is the great kindness of the guru you may

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:44.920
 recognize the gold but that will not dispel the hunger you must sell it and

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:50.000
 prepare food by frying cooking or roasting it and then eating it will end

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.120
 the hunger in the same way after the guru gives you the direct recognition

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:59.600
 through practice your mistake will be eliminated and you will be liberated the

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:04.760
 Mahayana sutras and the montreana tantras are all in agreement that your own mind

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:10.960
 in that way is Buddhahood however the sutras do not provide the direct

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:16.280
 recognition that your body is Buddhahood and therefore it is a long path

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:22.160
 achieving Buddhahood after three incalculable eons the highest tantras

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:26.200
 have the methods for attaining Buddhahood within one lifetime they are

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:30.620
 profound because of the direct recognition of your own body as the

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:36.600
 deities therefore the highest tantras teach in complete detail that your own

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:42.480
 body is the mandala of the deity such as Samvara Guryasamaja the eight Haruka's

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:49.080
 and so on in brief the sarma and ningma are in accord that the five skandhas are

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:52.800
 the five buddhas the five elements are the five consorts the eight

00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:56.760
 consciousnesses are the eight bodhisattvas and the eight sensory objects

00:27:56.760 --> 00:28:03.240
 are the eight female bodhisattvas and this song continues to elaborate some of

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:11.320
 the detail of what we kind of tune into when all of a sudden we relax and let

00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:19.240
 our nature do what it does so we're not just imagining something or pretending

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:25.720
 according to this view the Buddha's view of the tantras and even the sutra view

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:34.040
 that we have this innate essence this Buddha nature so very quickly the three

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:38.080
 samadhis which are discussed extensively in all of these teaching we've received

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:44.720
 these and it's in Rinpoche's commentary on the due jimter Saranandru the first

00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:51.280
 is a true nature samadhi the second is the all-arising compassion samadhi and

00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:57.480
 the third is the seed syllable causal samadhi so raga asi just went over this

00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:02.680
 he just didn't use these terms so the true nature samadhi recognize your own

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:09.800
 nature now so here this is this is the view of the sudden approach of the union

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:13.880
 of creation completion stages not the gradual or we build from the outside and

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:19.160
 then release and relax this is the sudden approach the union of creation

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:23.040
 and completion so it starts with the true nature samadhi recognize your nature

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:31.000
 now in that recognition it's unstoppable the compassionate arising energy that

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:36.760
 naturally includes everything not because something turned it on not

00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:39.960
 because something bad happened but it just naturally is inclusive and

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:45.400
 compassionate nothing is left out of the nature everything is accommodated and

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:51.120
 included this five wisdom teachings in the tantras say so much about this and

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:55.840
 then when that natural all-arising compassionate energy which is just

00:29:55.840 --> 00:30:01.720
 spontaneously there take shape this is called the seed syllable samadhi or the

00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:07.320
 causal samadhi and this in terms of visualization practices when this

00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:12.640
 emptiness awareness with its clear knowing quality starts to compassionately

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:20.120
 responsibly take form to alleviate the suffering of all beings this is where a

00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:28.920
 mandala comes from so from the true nature and its pervasive compassion it

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:35.360
 starts to distill into featured forms salient landscapes and that goes

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:39.160
 according to the sadhana practice and the lineage instructions of that practice

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:46.320
 so we imagine Lee follow this lineage sequence we pretend so that eventually

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:50.960
 we actually see this is one avenue that how the nature actually shapes itself

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:57.960
 when we show up and really fully participate with it so we go from the

00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:04.640
 true nature it's unstoppable pervasive compassionate energy that starts to

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:09.640
 distill into a seed syllable that becomes a ritual object usually on a

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:15.080
 lotus with some common of seed that then becomes more more form as an entity a

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:20.120
 deity with features and in the features and then there's other deities

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:25.920
 enlightened beings around them as a retinue and on and on the mandala

00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:33.160
 populates a universe of enlightened activity and we have the big bigness the

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:39.840
 giant kind of gigantic vision view tawa that this is possible the nature is

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:46.120
 possibly like this this courageous view and we just like let ourselves tune into

00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:50.320
 it this is a big feature of being a Vajrayana practitioner we have that

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:54.960
 level of bravery we're really trying to encourage that in ourselves this could

00:31:54.960 --> 00:32:00.040
 be true and in our sadhana practice time we let ourselves be in that view and we

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:04.300
 don't disrupt it with what's going on and what are the features and that's the

00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:09.280
 post meditation study contemplation time which definitely is vitally important

00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:13.800
 and is skipped way too often then there's the meditation time where we just let

00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:18.720
 ourselves be in the imaginal space the visualization the creation stage that's

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:25.120
 arising from the true nature and we use our natural capacities our body our

00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:30.880
 speech our mind as tantra practitioners not just enlightened wake wakefulness

00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:39.800
 or wisdom because that was shown in Zen Zen mind beginners mind formless like

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:44.200
 wakeful attention wisdom wisdom mind but this also includes wisdom speech and

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:50.360
 wisdom body the world and its inhabitants the semi-form and the form

00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:58.200
 this is pure body pure speech pure mind so this is a tantra view so this is a

00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:02.040
 very quick kind of jumping into the three samadhi's which are the root it's

00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:06.120
 the bedrock assumption of all of the Tibetan Buddhist visualization practice

00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:10.400
 including the due jimter sarnandra and how amazing we start our whole sequence

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:17.880
 of practice with such a profound such a profound kind of a method like how

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:23.280
 amazing like we've been like to do the we're so blessed these wisdom beings

00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:27.720
 like have so generously offered this to us now and but we still have to line up

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:31.240
 with kind of like we have to make sense of it to some degree know some essential

00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:36.920
 points apply them over time in a dedicated way let them change us let

00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:41.640
 them inform and kind of open our natural capacities and just be with them and let

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:48.160
 the nature do what it does let the blessings do what they do so that's the

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:54.160
 three natures very succinctly like like embarrassingly succinctly it's very

00:33:54.160 --> 00:34:00.460
 quick there's so many teachings on this and we should really study them and I

00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:05.160
 need to study them a whole lot more then we really more importantly need to apply

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:09.920
 them practice them and let them change us we we'd like we'd like have the

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:14.440
 instructions we like know what the map is and then we start like actually using

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:18.960
 our own mind and heart to like be in that terrain like to take that inner

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:24.120
 journey and populate it with that world space according to the instructions as

00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:27.480
 sadhana is just saying now it's like this now it's like this now you see this now

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:30.760
 you move this way now this happens and then it arises and it moves it it's

00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:33.720
 literally we're just it's like we're watching a movie but the movies our own

00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:37.200
 mind and heart and we're letting it unfold according to the lineage

00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:41.420
 structure and then it just takes us there like a conveyor belt that's what a

00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:46.680
 Yana is a vehicle just like takes us along and then we're says hi you're

00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:53.760
 here and then we're like finally and then we can relax put all this endless

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:58.240
 drama behind us and then to actually be available to help beings not just hurt

00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:03.560
 them and hurt ourselves and all the kind of crazy things we do these are the

00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:09.240
 three samadhi's then there's three qualities that Kemba Rinpoche and he

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:13.160
 went over extensively in this book a central journey of life and death

00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:20.620
 volume one indestructible nature of body speech and mind this is just so many

00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:27.680
 precious teachings I mean really this is so so precious the three qualities are

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:35.880
 clarity purity and stability and these are related to the three samadhi's -

00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:41.400
 there's so much we can say about this stuff the true nature true nature of

00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:46.840
 samadhi to go back true nature samadhi purifies the dying purifies the form

00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:54.600
 realm the true nature samadhi is so open doesn't hold on to anything so when

00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:59.360
 we're dissolving then it purifies the tendency to want to hold on to something

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:03.880
 in formless realms we there's no thing to hold on to it purifies the habit to

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:10.880
 get rigid lock in all arising compassion samadhi they say purifies the all the

00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:16.800
 form realms with very subtle level form not here we're to the desire realm the

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:22.840
 form realm it purifies the after-death Bardo when the true nature just in all

00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:28.200
 of its glory just booms out with sounds and lights and shapes in this natural

00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:32.480
 mandala of our body that's been locked in this human fleshy vessel the body

00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:37.960
 stops boom the nature shines out as peaceful wrathful deities and this all

00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:43.160
 arising samadhi all arising compassion samadhi purifies our sense of like seeing

00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:47.160
 who these Buddhas are actually showing up our nature is showing up as our best

00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:55.440
 friend but we see it as an adversary as an enemy as a stranger and we run away

00:36:55.440 --> 00:37:01.200
 purifies the habit to run away from how amazing we are this booming vital energy

00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:05.320
 we have well I just want this version of meditation I just want to look at this

00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:10.800
 part of reality not the whole thing this this one little piece it purifies the

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:15.680
 habit so not only does it purify the habit to just start to lock but to lock

00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:20.560
 into one thing so this that true nature or sorry the all rising compassion

00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:26.400
 samadhi purifies the habit of the semi form or so the form realms and speech the

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:33.480
 semi form the energy the wind and then they say thirdly then that final third

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:39.120
 samadhi the seed syllable samadhi purifies becoming in birth right so just

00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:44.280
 like the seed syllable samadhi arises out of emptiness and clarity their union it

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:51.320
 arises purely so it's pure birth pure manifestation pure expression and then

00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:55.080
 we get to train and like oh how is this life like a pure expression of the

00:37:55.080 --> 00:38:01.020
 mandala as a deity with a retinue all these deities everyone's a deity doing

00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:06.840
 enlightened activities for the benefit of all beings it purifies our habit to

00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:13.680
 for birth in a samsaric way the habits are just blocking so tight to this me my

00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:19.720
 body my history my all that it purifies that tight tight tight grasping and it

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:24.200
 opens it and it purifies they say the desire realm which is this sentient realm

00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:29.800
 that humans are a part of here and it purifies body it is negative habits of

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:35.840
 body so we purify our mind our speech our body with these three samadhi's so

00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:40.600
 then what's left is the wisdom and dala of the enlightened speech enlightened

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:44.040
 mind and lightened body of all the buddhas that's the only thing that could

00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:49.440
 be left once all the rigidity is dissolved the world becomes enlightened

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:53.560
 activity that's because it we see that that was happening and then we gain the

00:38:53.560 --> 00:39:00.040
 power to like co creatively play with it and actually serve the lineage become a

00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:05.600
 node of kind of activating people activating beings so they're like fully

00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:09.720
 supported exactly how they need to be supported and their Buddha nature just

00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:14.520
 shines on because all the tensions start to you know gradually melt away it takes

00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:18.840
 all this it takes time we all know if we're still here listening to this rant

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:23.640
 and if we're still here practicing we keep showing up the Vajrayana

00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:28.360
 practitioners then we know this takes time and we have to stay dedicated and

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:32.760
 committed flexibly stretch little stretch little stretch little stretch

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:37.800
 little stretch and we gain our capacity we kind of reaffirm our kind of majesty

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:43.120
 as a naturally enlightened pure being we're like trying to really kind of let

00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:47.440
 ourselves but confidently bravely believe that and so then this really

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:53.440
 goes and very quickly into the these three points for all union of creation

00:39:53.440 --> 00:40:00.800
 and completion practices clarity stability purity clarity is like the

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:04.760
 all the qualities of the deities everything's bright and it has a profound

00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:09.320
 meaning so we're trying to bring the detailed brightness and like really

00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:13.360
 connect to the meaning of the visualization let those deeper

00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:21.480
 meanings like saturate and populate our experience they become the mandala that's

00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:29.760
 like the quality like the features and then the second is the purity it's

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:35.720
 actually free of any fixation we just let the mandala do what it does without

00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:40.120
 holding it grasping it reifying it locking it freezing it and I know that's

00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:43.960
 like a fear-inspiring thing to let go but we let go and then the nature is

00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:49.240
 more empowered to do what it does it's less funneled through me it's more just

00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:53.600
 allowed to interdependently arise for the benefit of beings which that's what it

00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:58.320
 all naturally do if we stop trying to like attaching our strings to everything

00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:05.200
 and then stability is that confidence the Vajra pride the utter conviction the

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:11.800
 certainty the bravery the fearlessness to just this is it this is a pure mandala

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:15.920
 a pure a pure-bodied pure speech pure mind and I'm gonna in this session I'm

00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:22.280
 gonna show up and just not have any doubt be here be with Gurum jay be with the

00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:25.360
 Herukas be with the Buddhas and the bodhisattvas and the Aras and all the

00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:29.800
 Dharma and all the lineage masters all in their field of blessing energy and

00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:35.360
 that's all that's here and just be with it and just surrender to it and it's

00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:39.320
 only gonna be loving and compassionate and wise and we have this total field

00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:43.920
 where then we can totally be kind of really transformed by the lineage

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:51.800
 blessings so we can let go and like be reshaped and reactivate all these

00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:55.680
 goodness qualities of ourselves instead of reactivate all the kind of like

00:41:55.680 --> 00:42:01.480
 scared fearful qualities of ourselves can really kind of finally be at home

00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:07.960
 with ourselves and with each other and then this courageous view then it all it

00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:11.520
 does is do outreaching bodhisattva activities and what does that mean it's

00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:14.680
 always turning towards the Dom Dharma the nature it always has this

00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:19.160
 renunciation bodhicitta and pure perception or devotion all three are

00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:24.360
 always combined in these practices so this is a kind of very quick whirlwind

00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:31.520
 kind of tour clarity purity stability clear visualization really connect to

00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:36.000
 the meaning and without rigidity and fixation and then really if they say the

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.280
 Vajra pride can also be talked about as feeling the presence of the Buddha of

00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:43.640
 the Buddhas of the living mandala not just my pretend visualization but

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:48.840
 actually letting the jhana sappas the wisdom beings inhabit and become utterly

00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:53.280
 mingled and merged that literally everything I see and hear and think is

00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:58.280
 Buddha activity and then we rest with that and we let it happen and do its own

00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:02.680
 natural thing and it starts to get all these more robust salient features and

00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:07.800
 the details get sharper and the devotion gets stronger the heartache for all the

00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:12.520
 beings that don't see how awesome they are just gets so tender and we have the

00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:18.000
 courage really that unstoppable compassion I will take responsibility to

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:22.720
 free all these beings free them from what from not seeing how awesome they are

00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:28.240
 that's it how to do that meet them where they are whatever is available to just

00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:34.760
 have their own mandala auto-enhance not a forceful conversion just line up with

00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:39.560
 them support and then they can relax hold on to fight this person's on my

00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:45.280
 side finally a friend they relax and then the qualities start coming out and

00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:50.000
 then they just again and again and then they get to inhabit their own bravery

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:54.160
 and their own unique way and they get to create their mandala and then I create

00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:57.760
 my mandala you create your mandala we create our mandalas now we're talking

00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:02.000
 about really for real Vajrayana view they said this is already how the nature

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:06.560
 is and we need these sadhana practices that just there's these supports they'll

00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:13.160
 set it up it's like in t-ball or something make it almost impossible to

00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:18.600
 hit and then you just boom you know but we're like it's like a it's like these

00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:23.000
 mega baseball stars playing t-ball like if you don't hit a home run every time

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:30.420
 sums up so we have to keep checking in we have these innate capacities a little

00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:36.080
 by little it's a tender thing just the Goldilocks right amount of stretching

00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:41.520
 not too hot not too cold not too tight not too loose this is all really

00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:47.640
 straight-up Dharma I'm not just trying to like make some things up so but our

00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:51.440
 time is always limited in these things and then we have to get to the practice

00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:54.360
 time where we really in this and hopefully like we were let it let

00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:57.880
 ourselves be in this anyway and don't have to wait till just sitting down on a

00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:02.160
 cushion to actually check in with our true nature that's why are these three

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:06.960
 samadis are always available be with a nature it's naturally compassionate and

00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:11.680
 let your own sense doors like fill it in with these beautiful colors and shapes

00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:16.440
 and sounds and just like relax and just like playfully engage and do that for a

00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:24.520
 minute and then you can go back to you know making widgets for the benefit of

00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:30.620
 all beings or whatever the artistic offering is because widgets make this

00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:38.520
 world go round thank you friends thank you thank you

00:45:46.440 --> 00:46:11.600
 I give a final thought quick final thought I didn't get to it because I ran

00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:17.860
 out of time but in terms of creation and completion and kind of the amazing

00:46:17.860 --> 00:46:24.620
 opportunity of discovering and co-creating worlds of enlightened

00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:31.340
 activity it's quite a big it's a big statement and the one thing I didn't get

00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:37.700
 to is the need to always have discernment or prajna there's not a

00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:41.540
 single teaching in Buddhism that says what you need to do right now is turn

00:46:41.540 --> 00:46:49.400
 off your prajna it's always a sharpening of prajna more clearly attuning and

00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:56.360
 seeing what helps now what is happening now causally speaking like what are the

00:46:56.360 --> 00:47:02.960
 causes and conditions happening now so I can most optimally be shaped by and work

00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:07.880
 with situations with life with my experience and the one thing I'm always

00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:14.040
 going to come in contact with is my own mind and so I need to always keep

00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:19.600
 turning towards wisdom and that wisdom would expand as it expands it wants to

00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:23.360
 include more of the nature of reality relative reality and absolute reality

00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:28.840
 and so it's naturally going to also have to soften and become more compassionate

00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:34.480
 and inclusive so it's going to get more fierce and brave to accommodate more of

00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:39.720
 the nature it's going to more compassionately include accommodate and

00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:45.640
 uplift but we need to do it as we're ready according to what is helpful for

00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:52.440
 my mind now so we need a lineage to offer a next step guidance and next next

00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:57.160
 next next step guidance to give a map and we need the sangha support to keep us

00:47:57.160 --> 00:48:03.440
 in check we need direct feedback from teachers from those way ahead of us so

00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:10.940
 we can kind of avoid certain kind of ways of shutting down of kind of just of

00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:16.240
 like taking on someone else's arena when it's I'm not ready to take on that arena

00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:20.460
 or maybe there's something someone else is doing or a situation that's I don't

00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:24.040
 want to be shaped by that I'm not ready for it I don't want to it's not healthy

00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:28.720
 we need this discernment so always prajna should to go on

00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:33.360
 bodhicitta and compassion should go on because I'm always going to be experiencing

00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:38.160
 my own mind and as my imaginal capacities increase also the personal power

00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:44.200
 increases bhajriyana talks about that as skillful activity so we have a teacher

00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:47.720
 have a lineage have a guidance that basically they're going to kind of

00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:51.760
 introduce some new things that make us show up a little more fully but it's

00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:56.840
 always me who's the one who has to show up and that's always according to what

00:48:56.840 --> 00:49:01.680
 I'm ready for and I need to use that wisdom discriminating or discerning

00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:08.120
 wisdom to actually play within a wider arena of Darmadatta to recognize not

00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:11.600
 play favorites within the things in the Darmadatta because they're all the same

00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:16.560
 nature of reflections but to not mix and match the reflections and the causation

00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:22.040
 because that's what mirror like wisdom is doing so all these five wisdoms in

00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:27.240
 terms of creation and completion practices we need to be clear that we

00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:32.160
 have to like include all of them all of them are included in prajna and I think

00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:36.560
 that's so it should be a softening of heart and a clarifying of mind and then

00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:40.880
 we'll kind of like be able to like have that bravery the courageous view to

00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:47.160
 really let ourselves like see everything is the mandala of deity mantra and

00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:49.400
 dharmakaya
