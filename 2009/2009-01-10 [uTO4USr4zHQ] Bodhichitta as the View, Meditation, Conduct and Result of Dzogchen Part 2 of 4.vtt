 [END PLAYBACK]

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.960
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:53.080
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:00:53.080 --> 00:01:00.500
 And he, again, therefore, also the Dhamma Kaya Buddha, the Samad Bhadara,

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.000
 when he gave this teaching, on the Konsi Jaipur.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.080
 The Konsi Jaipur is named the Bodhijata king of all creations.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.480
 So that is what, really, because it's so important.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:18.600
 And that Dzogchen itself is the embodiment of the Bodhijata.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.480
 And then Bodhijata, of course, you all know there's two Bodhijata,

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.680
 which is known as the outreaching Bodhijata in a relative level.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.120
 And then the Bodhijata, which is free from the attachment and grasping,

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.880
 and that which is known as then the absolute Bodhijata in one way.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.760
 So this Bodhijata of Dzogchen is united together

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.360
 with all the separating the absolute and the relative to Bodhijata,

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.180
 not going to target it in one single status.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.760
 And therefore, at the beginning of time, when we meditate in the practice,

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.560
 and Dzogchen practice more kind of focus on the emptiness aspect

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.120
 with true nature, and that's because due to our grasping duality regiment,

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.360
 that carried us, like, so long time, life after life,

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.880
 that kind of whoring, grasping, and kind of regiment attitude

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.800
 was the mostly kind of like principle factors of the obstacle.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.520
 Therefore, immediately teaching kind of tells the emptiness,

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.160
 emptiness, kind of emptiness, that teaching.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.120
 But emptiness alone is of course you all know.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.520
 And we will all through this, it's not really the true nature itself alone.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.640
 Emptiness, the fullness status, and so what is empty, that is full,

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.080
 and what is full, and that is emptiness.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.240
 And in that case, what is empty, that is compassion, or great compassion.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.160
 What is great compassion, and that is emptiness.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.640
 They are united together without any slightly kind of the distinctions

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.960
 between them as like even one single here is there,

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.760
 between there we can find, completely united.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.720
 And that is what we should kind of recognizing,

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.920
 and kind of re-conforming that view,

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.000
 or that understanding in our heart, in the mind.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.160
 So what we should do is we should think of the same things

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.000
 as we have in our mind.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.640
 We should think of the same things as we have in our mind.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.040
 We should think of the same things as we have in our mind.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.520
 We should think of the same things as we have in our mind.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.360
 We should think of the same things as we have in our mind.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.080
 We should think of the same things as we have in our mind.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.720
 We should think of the same things as we have in our mind.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.200
 We should think of the same things as we have in our mind.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.360
 We should think of the same things as we have in our mind.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.360
 We should think of the same things as we have in our mind.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.640
 And therefore, again, because when

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.280
 we received our practice at Zouki,

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.880
 we should not kind of carry away, again,

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.480
 with the kind of emptiness, attitude,

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.120
 and ignoring all the beauty of that emptiness.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.640
 And then it will kind of, again, become the extreme status.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.120
 And that, for those reasons, repeatedly

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.800
 all those gracious teachers, warned to the practice,

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.160
 then shouldn't fall completely in the kind

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.360
 of extreme nihilism or kind of that emptiness, that ditch,

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.160
 ditch, or the black hole.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.480
 Then it will become truly black hole.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.000
 And even you don't point out where we are going, jumping.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.360
 And so for those reasons, that is so important to kind of--

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.880
 from now, kind of starting to all cooperate

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.840
 and target these beautiful things.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.840
 Targeting and practice will make, then, everything beautiful.

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.400
 Beginner is beautiful.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.840
 May it is beautiful, and concluding in achievement

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.600
 will be the beautiful one.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.720
 And for all those reasons, for example,

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.360
 the first gracious, first the most important,

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.600
 or first the most famous lineage holder of the Dzogchen

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.680
 after Gharap Durya, or the Gharap Durya,

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.440
 the most famous disciple you all know,

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.960
 the Manjishri Mitra, in a debate called Jambahini.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.680
 And Jambahini is the first one who also

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.880
 wrote the commentaries on the Dzogchen teaching renowned,

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.200
 which is, as you all know, and which is known as, and then

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.880
 meditating on the bodhicitta, bodhicitta.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.800
 And that was the title of the Dzogchen teaching,

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:37.120
 that he didn't name any other fancy names to his book,

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.400
 the first book of the Dzogchen teaching,

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:44.640
 only meditating on the bodhicitta, all which

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:52.560
 is a nugget gold liquid from the stone.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.280
 I mean, that's just roughly my translation.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.040
 Again, this book is already translated.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.120
 I think I'm sure you all, maybe many of you,

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:03.640
 have this text too.

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:09.280
 And so that is what this great famous Dzogchen master

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.360
 named to his book, not any other names,

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.320
 except instructions on the bodhicitta.

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:35.480
