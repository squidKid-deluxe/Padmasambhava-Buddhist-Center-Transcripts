 [FOREIGN]

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 [FOREIGN]

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 [FOREIGN]

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 [FOREIGN]

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 [FOREIGN]

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 [FOREIGN]

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 And now, the marriage or the activity again is all this,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 I mean, generally, entirely Buddha teaching is to the marriage or the activities.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 All the methods, every teaching is really like teachings on the merit.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 Merit, how to accumulate merit.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 When you accumulate the merit, that means then we are also cleansing and purifying

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 all the negativities, same time as we all know.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 So therefore, marriage or the activities are very, very important.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 This marriage or the activity, not one way to understand it,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 all this marriage or the activity can be summarized as into the six parameters.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 Six parameter practice is also marriage or the activities.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 And that is again, as we said or you know,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 is that the substantial marriage or the activities in substantial marriage or the activities

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 or marriage or the activity with the focus and without the focus of that.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 And those six parameters, of course, you all know that.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 Again, just to list the names are then that like generosity parameter

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 and the morality parameter and then patience parameter,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 your effort and concentration and the wisdom.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 And above that, then there is also another pole more than makes 10 parameters.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 Again, you all know basically those are known as then,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 skillful means parameters, aspiration are parameters,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 the ability or the courage, courage parameters.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 That is just one way to translate.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 And then wisdom parameter or the primordial wisdom parameters.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 Those all are marital activities.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 And there is another way to explain, I think that also to the accumulation merit,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 but activity particularly again, such as known as then,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 such as the like and particularly related with the dharmas or the scriptials.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 Scriptural Dharma that particularly related with the,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 among the like Buddha Dharma Sangha and the Three Jewels

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 is something connected with more to the Dharma.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 And that is often in the teaching said, for example,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 when you also transcribe in the teachings,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 teaching is also marital activities or distributing the teachings

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 to the others when they want and helping that,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 available that it is also marital activities.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 And then, and such as all or writing down or printing those things.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 And then this is the Dharma and then making...

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 And even the tumour, that's all.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 Okay, so then maybe we just said,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 first is like the Dharma text that distributing

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 and then making offering over the joy and appreciation,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 while we're task wrapping, all the distributing the Dharma.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 And then, and then listening and...

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 Oh, sorry, again.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 Then the task wrapping, distributing, that is one.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 Making offerings, that's second.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 And then generosity, generally kind of a generous practice.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 That is third.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 And then giving the kind of like words of the wisdom to the...

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 I bought a Dharma. I bought a letter to the Dharma.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 Or listening to the teaching.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 And then reciting the teaching,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 such as joining the Heart Sutter and so forth.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 And then contemplating the teaching.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 And then again meditating or contemplating.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 And then again like cultivating the meditation.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 And those are particularly related with teaching.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 Teachings and those are all meditory activities.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 Then again, these are not meditory activities

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 and very powerful beneficial to ourselves, to the others,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 such as then raising of the prayer flags

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 that many of you know already.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 It is very, very considering, very special practices.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
