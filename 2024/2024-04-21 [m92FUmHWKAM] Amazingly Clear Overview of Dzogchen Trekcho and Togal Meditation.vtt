00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.600
 Thank you very much. Thank you. Again, we continue to follow the teaching, Dzogchen teaching,

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:16.180
 and again, we strengthen our motivation, the motivation of the dual and the appreciation,

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.280
 and we struggle with the motivation of the body.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.960
 And you know all the beings, every living being are the beings of six realms,

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.520
 trying to bring them to the enlightenment state,

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.420
 or remove their all suffering the difficult troubles,

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.800
 and then bring them to the path, from the path to the enlightenment,

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.500
 then finally, enlightenment state, of kind of having those intentions.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.900
 With that purpose, where is that purpose that I'm going to reflect on?

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:51.080
 The teaching, practice, meditation, help for all the beings with the genuine body together,

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.040
 in the heart, in the mind, and with that, and then also according to Dzogchen,

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.760
 already the teaching of this entire universe, all this very whole universe,

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.320
 already enlightenment state, already is pure land,

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.960
 but we don't see it because due to our duality and habitiveness and belonging there,

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:18.000
 reality really is all purely states, all the universe is in light, in light, pure land,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.840
 and all the beings are enlightened, and as well as our son, each of us,

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.920
 and those are known as the five dhyana Buddha, five human Buddha,

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.240
 those are we heard in the teaching many times,

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.040
 five arrogant, the five male Buddha, the five element, the five human Buddha,

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.320
 all the lambs in the different parts of the body, the human,

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.960
 the body's hypothesis, and men and human, those are all made in the teaching,

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.040
 so those are really the teaching, actually reality it is in that status,

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:54.320
 and in order to discover that reality, that truth, truth, of course, we are practicing,

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.440
 we are practicing and meditating with that, and so now all with this thought,

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:04.240
 and then now, here we go to the, again, on the teaching, to celebrate,

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.040
 and this is again, teaching, Dzokhi teaching, Dzokhi teaching, as we all know,

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:15.120
 there's two section of the teachings, those are the two teachings,

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.520
 Dzokhi teaching, and Dzokhi teaching, really, or sometimes, in the teaching mentioned,

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.800
 Dzokhi teaching, which is built from the beginning,

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:30.200
 and Dzokhi teaching is spontaneous, inherited teachings,

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:38.600
 and those are terminologies used to clarify the qualities of these two natures, two natures,

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.680
 both are united, both are, both are nature of our mind,

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.280
 it's not something we're talking of the outside qualities,

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.880
 we're talking about each of our own nature of the mind,

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.720
 our nature of the mind is built from the beginning of that,

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.560
 that is the Gada, in the very word, Gada, Gada means built from the beginning,

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.080
 or, yeah, that's built from the beginning of the Tukyu,

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.920
 which is great, emptiness practice, teaching, practicing,

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:16.360
 and Dzokhi is spontaneous, inherited quality, discovery, instantly,

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.280
 Dzokhi means leaping over, or discovery,

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:29.560
 what we discover, discover and inherit qualities of this, our own nature of the mind,

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.400
 inherit all the qualities or the richness, discovery, instant,

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:42.480
 how, instantly, or toga, and with techniques, techniques and instructions that follows,

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.440
 follow we discover, so this time, and also these two teachings,

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:55.160
 some are named, that Tukyu practices, we don't have to do any particular effort,

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.640
 is, that's what in the teachings sometimes we use the terminology,

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.680
 Tukyu teaching is the practice of all the lady peoples,

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:09.620
 and the Tukyu, toga practice is those who are the endeavor,

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:16.120
 joyful effort, why is it, because Tukyu don't have to do any particular things,

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:22.360
 be relaxing, rest, enjoy, and be in that stillness, with the latter postures,

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.680
 but otherwise there's nothing they need to do,

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.560
 for those reasons, in the teachings mentioned, there's nothing to meditate,

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.200
 no meditation is Tukyu meditations, that means, so that means what?

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.400
 There's no meditation with subject and object, with effort,

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:45.360
 just discover the innate nature, exactly as it is nature of the mind,

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.320
 relax, be bring in that stillness, that's for that reason,

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.600
 even though it needs effort, but with nature or with solvents,

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:00.320
 when we meditate, it's effortless, effort is consumption,

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.760
 effort is the dualities, and in the teachings said,

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:13.560
 the public activity will not lead beyond the public activities,

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.960
 and so if we activate something, try to do something,

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.120
 that is not the reason, Tukyu meditations, Tukyu meditations,

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.600
 as we went through and you all know, it's not something I'm talking,

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.840
 in a way, just as a mind to all of us, just simply relaxing,

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.200
 and yesterday we went through that, also the teachings said,

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:40.600
 look to the looker, that is, when you look to the looker,

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:48.760
 that moment, the thinking of the subject of the to look,

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:54.800
 and the way to look that object, subject, object, both are merged,

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:00.280
 instant, there is no division, totally kind of openness,

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:07.720
 free, fresh, naked, in the transparent, lucid state,

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:13.400
 that realization, understanding this nature of the mind,

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:19.040
 nature of everything, for that reason, there is nothing to explain,

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:26.360
 nothing to say anything, even we want to say there is nothing we can explain,

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:31.720
 for that reason, the great master, Thard Kahneman, in his teachings said,

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:38.440
 to explain of this profound meaning, even the Buddha's tongue is short,

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:42.480
 Buddha's tongue is short, to explain, because there is nothing to explain,

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:48.440
 Buddha explained everything, inconceivable, inexpeable, unborn, unseasoned,

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:55.920
 pervasive, transparent, beyond the conception, those are the explanations,

00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:03.600
 there is nothing further more to explain, this is reality, nature,

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:10.120
 true nature, ourself, ourself, so discover that nature,

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:15.280
 be exactly as it is, then God has to feel from the beginning,

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:21.040
 why is it a feel, because in this nature, there is no obscurations,

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:26.160
 no negativities, no any kind of defilement,

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:32.240
 exactly at all, not even the names, totally feel,

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:36.360
 the heavens feel from the beginning, it's not just a feel,

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:41.600
 it's easily, it becomes pure, it is pure from the beginning,

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:49.600
 beginless times, it is pure, ordinary nature, that is pure from the beginning,

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:53.160
 that is, God has to choose, take your power,

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:59.240
 that pure from the beginning, openness, inconceivable, transparent, lucid,

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:05.960
 and emptiness, that call it, that nature is filled with, in the teachings said,

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:14.040
 filled with call it, filled with call it, or call it, maybe I translated, richness,

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:21.880
 all the richness, what that means richness, richness of all the enlightenment,

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:27.080
 versitums, compassion, loving kindness, five kayas,

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:32.520
 all the luxury callers we heard in the sambhokaya,

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:39.720
 that luxuries completely with inseparable, with that great emptiness,

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:43.720
 we open to the beginning, and how that happened,

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:47.880
 that happened in the teachings said, simultaneously,

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:53.160
 nobody propagated, nobody made effort to put there,

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:59.240
 it's naturally, naturally, it is all there,

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:06.440
 All the richness, inconceivable richness, when we live the traditions of those of other very

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:12.920
 energetic, the richness scholar of the Sambokayas, just progressive, inconceivable.

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:22.600
 Richness, every richness, richness of poems, richness of songs, richness of the smells,

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:30.840
 richness of the taste, richness of the touch and richness of the feelings or all the blessings.

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:40.680
 It's beyond. It's not consumption. It's not duality. That richness is the inherent nature

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:51.720
 of our own, this present mind. Tokara is instantly discovering that, that richness,

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:58.520
 discovering instantly, not ready for long way to go through all the path in Bhoomi's.

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:05.080
 And the path in Bhoomi in the very end of Mahayana teaching, of course, we will achieve that. But

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:12.840
 according Mahayana teaching, we go gradually developing, slowly by slowly, as we advance the

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:20.440
 path of Bhoomi's. One after another is a better and a better and a better and a better and then

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:27.560
 full-bloom in the way we reach enlightenment, but at home. But Tokara practices. So far,

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:35.560
 living all practices. From where? Living all from samsara, instantly to the enlightenment

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:44.360
 state. Instantly, in the world of duality, from there, we live up, living all. That's toga.

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:52.280
 So those are tech teachings of the toga practices, which is dukkin practices. Dukkin, therefore,

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:57.160
 then is called, is the highest teaching of the gracious teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni or Buddha

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:04.840
 Samatha Buddha, ever keep, or there's even nothing to give more than that. Everyone is directly

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:12.520
 discovered in a natural nugget, teaching the ultimate to discover. And for those days,

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:19.880
 many times, Dukkin, the essence of the 84,000, Buddha's teaching, essence of the Buddha's

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:28.440
 84,000 teaching, more conventional, more kind of neutralized, neutralized is the dukkin teaching.

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:35.160
 And the dukkin teaching, which is the dukka, the tekkyu and the toga teachings. And this time,

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:41.560
 we're going through the toga, so in the tokyu teachings. Again, the tekkyu teaching is the

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:42.680
 teaching me.
