00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.280
 Thank you very much, everyone. Thank you very much.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.710
 For that purpose, I'm going to be studying, contemplating and practicing, meditating on the

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.600
 teachings of the great teacher Lama Shabkar.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:50.040
 In terms of those all, to get within and to activate our beauty, we will understand it.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.000
 With this, then we go to again.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.700
 I'm talking about the motivations. The motivation as you are in the application. Probably there are

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:06.000
 always any teachings that I've said so many times, you know, that it's for renunciation talks.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.290
 And then also, the devotions of those are very, very crucial and important. Very crucial and

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:12.560
 important.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.480
 The renunciation for renunciation, as I further did mention, "Gremas Papramud", "Gremas Dzangu-Kung

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:24.560
ra" is anchor of the practices. Anchor that.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:32.600
 And then this devotion is really warm for the sunlight of the practices. We blend the seeds on the

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.560
 ground.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:40.860
 Now it's started developing and shooting out. Also, moisturizing. All those are like bodhicata, you

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:41.560
 know.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:48.560
 All are blended. But even though everything is there, we need sunshine and understand.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:56.240
 This devotion is sunshine, the warmth. And that will bring, then all, perfect soil, perfect

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.560
 condition, perfect situation.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:05.030
 Then is the brain growth of what we are expecting. If you continue taking care of that, it will

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.560
 come.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:12.900
 And so that's what it really is. So therefore, it's again, it's a little bit about this for ren

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.560
unciation, as I've been talking that, that, in a way, reminded to all of us.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.770
 Of course, it is precious human growth. And had we discussed a little bit about that, we all have

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.560
 the 18 endowments.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:35.560
 But sometimes we linger upon the 18 endowments 10 luxuries. Maybe 10 luxuries will be sometimes.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:45.370
 All in the text, in the sunrise, maybe is going down to the 17, 18, had to succeed, and the 15 and

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.560
 so forth. Maybe going down.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.560
 If that is happening, we should reactivate that. Because we all have that.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:01.560
 Why this all happening? Due to the obstacles. Due to the distractions. Due to the emotions.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.910
 Due to the mundane activities, habitually active activities. Even we have the full of those lux

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.560
uries, still is standing.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.560
 In a way, robbers are robbing those things. Caring with them. Caring with them.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.210
 Therefore, we have that. Because the practice aid is not going down by someone else, they are going

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:23.560
 to benefit you as too much.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.560
 Because we are going to practice aid. And that's what the greatest teacher of Buddha said.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:36.560
 Be, take responsibility yourself. Take responsibility yourself. That is really what it is.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.840
 So therefore, always like checking, checking all those things. That is our nose and our eyes. Mind

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:42.560
fulness.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:51.080
 Putting into the action and keeping up a world about our situation and circumstances, we keep up

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.560
 that.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:59.560
 And always trying to do the best. That is known as practicing. Practicing. Trying to do the best.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.560
 We are the ordinary sentient beings of the name of us. Therefore, we can make mistakes.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.560
 We can be disturbed by the emotions, distractions, habitually badness, so on and so forth.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:16.370
 But if we can't continue to carry with that stream or that river, then our practice, identity of

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:17.560
 practice is lost.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:25.930
 Therefore, it is responsible to check that. So we are always in tact of these eight endurance, all

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.560
 the ten actions.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:34.560
 That which is important. With those told and then reflecting on the impermanent.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.560
 Impermanent is entirely everything is within impermanent.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:48.560
 So we have always don't reflect the impermanent. What is that? Then it becomes the permanent.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:57.560
 Permanent attitude deceives us. It really deceives us. It is very deceiving. It is very naive.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.560
 It is very low key. But it is deceiving.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:10.560
 It is asked to see that who will become the loser in a way. Our self. What will go into those?

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:21.020
 Our spiritual growth. Our realization. Our development of the practice will become redundant or it

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.560
 will be lost.

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:32.260
 Therefore, we should always have this impermanent understanding. It is true. It is exactly. It is

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.560
 true.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:39.560
 So therefore, great master, masters, earlier after, as I listed yesterday, and you all know that.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:54.560
 Also reflecting on the whole universe or the whole reason impermanent. What in the teaching said?

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:54.560
 Meditate on the impermanent by reflecting on the universe is.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:02.900
 Universe is. So that means what meditate means you have to reflect on that. See that clearly as it

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:03.560
 is.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:09.560
 So that means we are broadening our knowledge and understand this.

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:17.300
 And it is a universal world. According Buddhism, where we are now, it is not here all the time. It

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.560
 is not being all the time.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:31.290
 It came. It came. And those are in the teaching mechanism. It taught 20 eons to develop this full

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:33.560
 function of this world.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:44.560
 20 eons is gradually developed. Gradually developed everything. First wind, then water, then earth,

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.560
 then fire in the whole space.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:54.090
 It is always there. But then all the graduated there. And now we are here. But now it is a function

00:06:54.090 --> 00:07:02.560
. And how long this world lasts? According Buddhism, it is going to stay another 20 eons.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:08.560
 20 eons going to stay. And then it starts, of course, leaving it from beginning times.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:15.720
 But even more, scientists, I don't know exactly how they say it, but how many things changed the

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.560
 world when they are talking that.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:24.560
 Once upon a time, maybe all these continents took it. Many of those took it.

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:31.980
 Then it is separated by the waves or the earthquakes. Then it is separated all over the sea. Asia,

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:36.560
 Europe, and Africa, and South Africa, or America.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:44.260
 Australia, all those, in a way, divided. According to scientists, it still is a movement. It still

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:45.560
 is changing.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.560
 I heard that. You know more better than that.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:55.830
 Sure is true. Buddhism says that there are two impermanents. One is called gross impermanent, and

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:58.560
 the other is subtle impermanent.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:04.340
 Sudden impermanent is always there. Therefore, then you bring the gross impermanent, and such of

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:06.560
 you are talking that impermanent.

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:12.560
 That is not just came by itself. Suddenly, it is moving. It is coming.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:19.560
 Every second, every moment is shifting and changing and moving.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:26.980
 So, as scientists say, it is still moving. And still Himalayan is growing. I am sure you have heard

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:27.560
 that.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:34.860
 The Himalayan is growing, and the Kaskar Mountains is still sinking. I don't know if it is true or

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:35.560
 not.

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:42.560
 Still, it is one of the oldest mountains on the Earth. And it is sinking.

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:47.560
 That means it is changing. All that is changing.

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:58.560
 And then according to Buddhism, then it is old, and a lot of teaching says golden eggs. And then,

00:08:58.560 --> 00:08:58.560
 through the evening.

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:06.560
 And then, the Kankalaya, the evening, in two quarters of the golden eggs is last.

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:15.560
 And then, only one quarter is left. And then, the teaching and the lectures. Those are in Buddhism.

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:19.560
 All that is changing, one after another.

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:26.950
 In the end, at the end of this universe, or according to Buddhism, at the end of the 20 years, this

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:28.560
 very world is destroyed.

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:37.560
 Completely destroyed by the fire, water, and wind. Completely destroyed.

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:48.560
 There is a cold in the Buddha's teaching in Abhidhana. There is no inhabit with state. All gone.

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:52.560
 Gone. Completely destroyed, destroyed.

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:57.560
 Then, how long is this, where the Earth is? What is the world it is?

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:07.560
 According to Buddhism, it will remain 20 eons, completely empty space. Nothing is existing.

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:12.560
 Empty space. But then again, it will reform.

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:21.560
 So, everything is 20 eons, 20 eons, 20 eons, 20 eons, and whole circle is 80 eons.

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:30.980
 80 eons in the Buddha teaching, mentioned big eons. Those 20 eons, the small eons, or the medium e

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:36.560
ons, big eons, is 80 eons.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:49.560
 So, 80 eons, the full circle of the universe, the world, existing, disillusioned, and disappeared.

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:51.560
 That will come.

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:58.960
 So, this is how everything is really changing. And then we look at all these, what things, what we

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:01.560
 see, how many things, even now changing.

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:09.560
 The earthquakes, hurricanes, and sightings, and natural disasters, one or another.

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:15.560
 So many things are changing and coming, and all that is happening.

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:21.560
 Many scientists, now everyone is saying it is because of due to the calamity changes.

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:26.560
 But it doesn't matter whatever, it is changing. It is really changing, so many things.

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:35.560
 So, those are known as the reflections, the impermanence above the universe of the world, all that.

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:40.560
 Then the reflection of the inhabitants of these beings.

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:49.960
 Inhabited beings, that means living beings, and of course in here, living beings, on earth, how

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:51.560
 many there?

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:59.940
 According to Buddha's teaching, among six realms, we have two living beings, actively, or two

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:07.560
 realms, actively engaging in this world, and which is the human and animals.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:13.560
 According to Buddha's teaching, all animals are not here, on this earth.

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:16.560
 There are many other countries in the different world.

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:30.560
 But who is sharing this, is by actively, or openly, by the animals and the human beings.

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:36.560
 Now we think of the human beings, how many things are getting changed?

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:44.720
 According to Buddha's teaching, ancient time, or golden age time, everyone is so happy, so excited,

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.560
 so calm, so free.

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:50.560
 There is no violence, no difficulty, no turbulence.

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:57.870
 Then there is this difficulty, the turbulence, all the fighting, the curling, all that started,

00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:02.560
 because of the growing emotions.

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:07.560
 It's all the stuff. At the same time, it becomes changed.

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:12.560
 One after another, then another, all that changes.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:15.560
 And then also in science, they say, the evolutions.

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:20.560
 At the beginning of time, those evolutions, whatever that is, it's changed.

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:25.560
 Now what we are? And they look to the evolutions.

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:32.560
 Those were the scientists. It's all changing, one after another.

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:36.560
 And then we start thinking, oh, those civilized countries.

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:41.560
 When people are talking about the minds, how civilized are those?

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:46.560
 Once upon a time, they dominate them, and control them.

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:58.200
 They are flourishing, prosperous. According to the historian, they are so, so prosperous, so

00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:58.560
 ordered.

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:02.560
 And then at the landed city, I heard, there is something.

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:06.560
 I mean, everyone you think this, that time, well, they have operated that time.

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:12.560
 No one thinks this, doing that, or just going to say, period.

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:18.560
 Like what they're after. And then not just only that, so many things we can see.

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:25.560
 Even now, we go, those tourists go to visit, all the rooms, all the monuments.

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:28.560
 They're not just the rooms and monuments at the time.

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:36.560
 But all they're so, so flourishing, beautiful, so kind of upkeeping, living up there.

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:43.560
 And now, it just becomes rooms, rooms.

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:50.560
 So this is how all that happened. All this happened, happened.

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:55.560
 And then, everything is changing, moving.

00:14:55.560 --> 00:15:00.560
 And even at the animal level, in Khetan, scientists said, dinosaurs.

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:03.560
 And now, those are distinct. Gone.

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:12.560
 Maybe, except, some say that alligators, many of them, and coconuts, and alligators.

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:18.560
 And then there's in the Puerto Rico, they're called checking of a tree.

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:21.560
 Checking of a tree, what is the name?

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.560
 - Cookie. - What? - Cookie.

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:25.560
 - Cookie. - Yeah, it could be cookie.

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:27.560
 But checking of a tree is what?

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:29.560
 - He won. - He won.

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:31.560
 He won. I heard it.

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:36.560
 Somehow, those are the, like, remaining of the, kind of like, dinosaurs.

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:38.560
 Dinosaurs, okay.

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:41.560
 So, but otherwise, majority dinosaurs, gone.

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:46.560
 Only we see in the museum, kind of empty.

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:49.560
 That, I mean, so many, really, things have changed.

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:52.560
 Shift, this, and that. I mean, just all this.

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:59.560
 That's just brilliant, you know, as reflecting in parliament, evolved, inhabited.

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:04.560
 Then we think of the, in the teachings, that this third group of the reflecting,

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:08.560
 is thinking of the noble beings.

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:10.560
 Noble beings.

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:15.560
 Noble beings such as, according to Buddhism, noble beings,

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:21.560
 all those ancient great masters, realizing masters, including Buddha Shakyamuni,

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:26.560
 such great beings, great power, great knowledge,

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:31.560
 and transforming water into the fire, fire into the water,

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:34.560
 walking in the sky, sleeping in the sky,

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:40.560
 still sitting on the sky, going through the walls.

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:44.560
 Walls, I mean, Buddha Shakyamuni, not just the Buddha Shakyamuni,

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:46.560
 are others.

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:48.560
 All those are others.

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:52.560
 One after another, we read this story in the teaching.

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:55.560
 How much they are, how powerful they are.

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:59.560
 They have completely conquered the phenomenal systems, where things are,

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:02.560
 changed, they shaped them.

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:08.560
 And then they elect 80 masters, those six ornaments of the jabbudim,

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:12.560
 so great scholars, masters.

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:18.560
 And now, what we see, only life stories, stories.

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:22.560
 And in it with, there's so many great masters came.

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:26.560
 One after another, great beings.

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:32.560
 And we started from the 8th century, during the time of the Gharapayama symbol,

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:35.560
 25 disciples of the Gharapayama symbol.

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:43.560
 Again, their spiritual power, realization power, changing, shifting things, elements,

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:51.560
 flying the sky, sky and moving so fast from distance to distance.

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:58.560
 And shifting things, stone in the gold, gold, water in the solid liquids.

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:01.560
 I mean, so many things, even there, those are really,

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:05.560
 there's some monasteries as treasures, as the object of treasure.

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:11.560
 They kept those, all these things.

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:15.560
 And then, in the Christianity, for example, Jesus Christ,

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:20.560
 who transformed the bridge, one bridge, for so many bridges,

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:27.560
 so many bridges, a small, small, small container of the building,

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:32.560
 changed so many, for so, for so many peoples.

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:38.560
 And also, he's renowned as son of God, God.

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:43.560
 But, however, on the surface level, also he left.

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:46.560
 It is all that you all know.

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:51.560
 And then, not just all those great saints, one after another.

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:57.560
 In the Hindu, there's so many great masters, great, those powerful,

00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:01.560
 that in that way, I say, of course, also in the new,

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:04.560
 in the Sarma schools of Triveda Business.

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:08.560
 There's so many great masters, really came, one after another,

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:14.560
 just like Buddha, he came, such as great master Maradepa, Marpa,

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:19.560
 and Gampobas, and then so forth, so forth.

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:22.560
 Great master, I mean, all these things.

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:28.560
 And then all those great thetans, masters, they're so powerful,

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:32.560
 they're really actually so strong, high, high.

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:35.560
 And when they did those whole beneficial activities,

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:41.560
 how powerful they are, how smooth they are, how efficient they are.

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:46.560
 But also, now is what it is, is only in the memories,

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:53.560
 only on the books that we did, only on the world vendors.

00:19:53.560 --> 00:20:01.560
 Their physical is not here, as used to, as it was in the time it's gone.

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:03.560
 So they are thinking of that.

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:05.560
 That was all known as, in the teachings,

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:10.560
 that reflecting the environment within holy beings,

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:12.560
 or novel beings, you like that.

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:17.560
 And then reflecting the environment with the powerful ones,

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:20.560
 powerful beings over this earth.

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:24.560
 So many powerful beings came, one after another,

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:26.560
 every country has its role.

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:30.560
 Really, one after another is so powerful.

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:36.560
 Even hearing names could be scared, that kind of powerful.

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:41.560
 Powerful and dominating, conquering, conquering every direction.

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:43.560
 Conquering.

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:48.560
 So majesty says, one after another, those powerful beings,

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:52.560
 beings, every country has that.

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:55.560
 We know that. You all know this.

00:20:55.560 --> 00:21:01.560
 And our bodies is just the only, again, historians.

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:05.560
 Every, maybe a psalm of navy, maybe not all of that,

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:12.560
 even in historians' stories, but psalm that we see in historians' stories.

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:19.560
 So this is known as reflecting the empowerment of the noble holy beings.

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:24.560
 They reflected the empowerment in a variety of ways.

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:28.560
 A variety. A variety of things.

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:31.560
 Thinking of the world, thinking of the beings,

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:34.560
 thinking of everyone, thinking of ourselves,

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:38.560
 for example, our family members, our friends, our neighbors,

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:45.560
 our young friends of the early age, thinking of that.

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:53.560
 Variety. And even our animals, our deer, like fat, fat animals.

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:57.560
 And all that we think, variety level.

00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:01.560
 Level. Come on, thinking of that.

00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:06.560
 It's all now. Many, most of it is gone.

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:12.560
 Most of it is disabled. It's only in our memories.

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:16.560
 That's how the samsara, or the world is.

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:21.560
 It's all in the ancient Buddha said.

00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:25.560
 Generally, the one, end of the world is dead.

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:29.560
 End of the building up is going to fall.

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:34.560
 End of the climbing up is going to fall.

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:41.560
 End of gathering will be, end of the gathering will depart.

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:45.560
 That is what it is too. It's all that.

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:49.560
 And therefore, what great Thapasthani said,

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:54.560
 we are gathering here as a short time, as a flea market.

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:58.560
 So a flea market won't last long term. Flea market.

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:01.560
 But when you come to the flea market, it's a short time.

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:03.560
 Maybe one day or whatever that is.

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:08.560
 And therefore, in particular, the family members and the friends,

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:11.560
 don't argue, don't fight.

00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:14.560
 It's a short time in the flea market, having a good time.

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:17.560
 And be nice to each other.

00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:19.560
 That's what the great Thapasthani said.

00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:23.560
 He's a disciple, a close disciple in Tengri region,

00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:29.560
 in west of it. West of it is.

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:34.560
 He said, "Toget, it's just a gathering, a short time in a minute."

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:40.560
 Therefore, be nice to each other, special to each other, kinder to each other,

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:42.560
 understandable to each other.

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:45.560
 And we do that. This is our practice.

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:49.560
 We're not just doing, kind of, living of the practice behind doing something there.

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:52.560
 Those are all our practices.

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:56.560
 Really, that's nothing else. That's the practices.

00:23:56.560 --> 00:24:01.560
 So therefore, those are known as, then,

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:07.560
 reflected in the environment, various ways, various ways.

00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:14.560
 And the next one is, then individually it comes on.

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:19.560
 I move to the environment as everything, everything.

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:21.560
 I'm in the environment.

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:25.560
 What will be? Cause. Where will be?

00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:28.560
 What condition? Those all are known.

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:31.560
 Nothing is short for us.

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:36.560
 Except we're sure that we will live.

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:38.560
 That is for sure.

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:41.560
 What situation? What circumstances?

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:46.560
 What conditions? What cause? All that is unknown.

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:50.560
 And therefore, we should take these opportunities

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:55.560
 and win those unsure, not sure.

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:58.560
 Therefore, take these opportunities,

00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:01.560
 and in the teaching setting, practice.

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:09.560
 Practice true good things that you will not feel regret, disappointed.

00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:14.560
 At the same time, you will give good impression to your family,

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:17.560
 friend, others, good impression.

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:21.560
 That is fulfilling of life, meaningful of life.

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:25.560
 Life. That is everything.

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:32.560
 Then, the next one is always reflecting the impermanence.

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:36.560
 Don't forget that impermanence. Don't forget.

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:38.560
 Every time, practice.

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:42.560
 When you practice, begin to remember the impermanence.

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:45.560
 And it's all, in the sense it's all impermanence.

00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:48.560
 We will get into it, or we will lie.

00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:50.560
 It's how wonderful.

00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:53.560
 Many people say that every day is a new day.

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:56.560
 It's true. Every day is a new day.

00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:59.560
 Every day is fresh.

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:01.560
 Every day is very fortunate.

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:05.560
 We are here, still, we're going to do good things.

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:10.560
 Enjoy, appreciate, take advantage of that time

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:19.560
 as much as we can, develop our mind, our understanding, knowledge.

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:22.560
 Knowledge is understanding what we develop.

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:26.560
 According to Buddhism, that is going with us when we leave.

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:31.560
 Whatever we develop with mind, it really goes.

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:35.560
 Whatever we develop with physical order, even though it's so good,

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:38.560
 but it's all going to stay behind.

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:44.560
 But develop it with the mind. Anything that we can do, develop.

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:48.560
 Of course, dharma, practice, love, kindness, compassion.

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:50.560
 Those are inherited nature.

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:53.560
 So that means it's reverting more.

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:57.560
 And then that will go with us.

00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:01.560
 So therefore, if one of them is in the teaching,

00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:03.560
 said impermanence is so spiritual,

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:08.560
 it helped in the beginning of time to activate our joyful effort.

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:10.560
 In thinking of impermanence,

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:14.560
 it will keep the joyful effort continually there.

00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:16.560
 And have the impermanence,

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:19.560
 there we will become more humble, more simple,

00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:22.560
 more peaceful, more practical.

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:24.560
 That really will come.

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:31.560
 And finally, then it brings the prudential of our journey of the realization,

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:34.560
 or journey of the practice.

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:38.560
 Our great Master Maharaja Mahasaya in one of his songs said,

00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:42.560
 "First I came to the mountains thinking of the impermanence.

00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:47.560
 Then I practiced and meditated.

00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:53.560
 Now the attitude of the impermanence,

00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:57.560
 that attitude, the uncomfortable feeling of the impermanence

00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:00.560
 completely go, completely go.

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:06.560
 Now he reached a fearless distance."

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:11.560
 That is how impermanence well ejected that realization.

00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:14.560
 This thinking of the impermanence,

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:16.560
 instead of impermanence,

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:20.560
 impermanence is wrong understanding.

00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:22.560
 There is nothing easily impermanence.

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:24.560
 It is just forever.

00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:29.560
 That impermanence attitude with sentient beings are devoted.

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:32.560
 Everyone, for example, in this world,

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:36.560
 they are really deceived by that, that.

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:40.560
 And doing all the different things, different things,

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:43.560
 and serving for the eagles, making so many troubles.

00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:47.560
 Maybe it has been a little bit of benefit for time, it was individual,

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:51.560
 but it created so many difficult troubles for everyone.

00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:53.560
 Still the thing is good.

00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:55.560
 Then all that can happen.

00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:58.560
 Nothing is really going to last.

00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:01.560
 As we said about that,

00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:06.560
 it is all those powerful things that came in this world.

00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:08.560
 It is all God.

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:11.560
 So those are really important impermanence.

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:14.560
 Again, in this one hour, what we did,

00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:18.560
 we went through really about the precious human body and impermanence.

00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:21.560
 And now we go to the videos on the slide.

00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:23.560
 We go to our Zogchen teaching.
