 and how do you know about it,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 and keep that intention.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 And that attitude is very, very...

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 And that was also clearly mentioned

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 to one point, the Great Westerner,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 Rakhini Kinshoja, asked you,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 "Murope Maasamag?"

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 "Oh, gracious teacher, we meditate

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 and practice Dzogchen alone

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 without the bodhicata.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 That is okay."

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 And then he said,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 "No, that is completely wrong."

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 Then Dzogchen,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 that Dzogchen is not really

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 Dzogchen practicing,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 but that is the obstacle

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 of Dzogchen.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 So that means, without the bodhicata,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 practicing on Dzogchen

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 is the obstacle

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 of Dzogchen.
