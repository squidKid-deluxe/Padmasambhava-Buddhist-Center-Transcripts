00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.090
 We're really confident in our retreat, one-month retreat. It's so wonderful and we're very thankful

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:13.160
, as I said, quite a few times, because it is so good to practice Dzogchen there.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:20.250
 Dzogchen there, and we have the same attitude, same thought, same destination, and same, our belief

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.640
 or our practices are the same.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.540
 So, stay involved, and that's what in the Buddha teaching always said, "Dzongpa, Tsongparakyo," by

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:29.880
 intubate reward.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:38.710
 The companion, they keep the same rhythm, similar practices, doing their best capabilities to

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:46.640
 advance Dzogchen on a supreme community, supreme groups, and supreme practitioners.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.620
 In that motivation, it's not something that we supreme that, but at least in the motivation level,

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.160
 our bodhicata, kindness, compassion, thought, that's what we've been talking about.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:04.590
 Whatever we've been able to glorify that, of course, it depends, due to the ego-cling, it's so

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:13.570
 strong, but at least we're leaning toward that and discussing that and glorifying that our best-

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.040
cover Buddhists.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:21.420
 And that is according to Buddhism, there's nothing more holy and more supreme, more better, and

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.760
 more simple, redundant, than to glorify that.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:33.320
 That means we will glorify our good heart, our heart, with joy and the African expanding, not just

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:39.840
 the good heart, expanding with all of everyone, everyone, and that is really so wonderful.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:49.520
 Thank you all for that. And now, we'll just go a little bit over what we've been discussing, and

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.560
 this time, we'll be just again...
