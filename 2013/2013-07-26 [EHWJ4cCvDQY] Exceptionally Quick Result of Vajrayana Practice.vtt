00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.720
 "This is the essential, this is the pillar, this is the concluding, this is all the structure of

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:14.560
 the meditation, so therefore we should always keep that. Remember that in mind, and with this we go

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.000
 to the meditation."

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.120
 "Now, when we go to this meditation in the very 16th, and in 16th that begins here, here I say the

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:29.160
 visualizations, here it begins. As I said in Vajrayana teaching, in a minute we already know, we

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.000
 all heard this many times from our many great teachers, teachers."

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.710
 Vadiyana teaching is so special. Among all the Buddha's teaching, Vajrayana teaching is known as

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:52.000
 the most powerful teaching that immediately connects to the way the nature is, without long delay,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 immediately connecting to us, to us, to that nature.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.720
 And for example, the basic Buddha's teaching, this process takes a long time to reach to that basic

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:10.700
 nature status. Vajrayana takes also long changes, that's what always those great masters in the

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.000
 teaching said, will take a long time.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.690
 And the teaching said, even Mahayana teaching will take three complex eons to reach to the basic

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:23.000
 goodness state, or the Buddhahood, the natural status.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:32.540
 Vajrayana teaching, in particular Dzogji teaching, always said, within this lifetime, if you have

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.080
 the joyful effort, courage and commitment, devotion and bodhicitta, we can reach, or we can reach

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.000
 enlightenment within 12 years, just less over a decade.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:54.190
 That's all. Let her, two extra years, then one decade. Even every, for example, that child born,

00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:00.000
 still that child is big enough, tense, right?

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 Teenagers. Teenagers, still 12 years old. In the teachings, 12 years, you can get enlightenment.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:18.220
 12 years in the teachings, really you put joyful effort, devotion, courage, commitment, devotion

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:25.680
 and bodhicitta blended in that whole, just blended in that, feel that in yourself and be in that

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.000
 state, in the practice.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.540
 12 years in this state, you really can get enlightenment. This is Dzogji teaching. Not just

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.000
 enlightenment pokes up, teaching is a warm song.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 A great, one of the great teacher, he reached in transcendental western realm of Bodhi in 12 years.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 This is one of the leading examples.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.110
 Of course, enlightenment is already, but she reached transcendental western realm of Bodhi. And

00:02:52.110 --> 00:03:01.000
 those many great masters, really, really, even in his own dungeon, said, just before his birth,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 there is one great mastery in his Tibet.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.880
 I mean, K.J. Mooji said too, he was very famous. Famous is called Nyala Pima Dandar. He was also

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.000
 reached transcendental realm of Bodhi, or realm of Bodhi.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.700
 Not transcendental, actually, he said, or realm of Bodhi, he reached that status. So this is just

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:28.200
 so many. You put that effort, and then of course, the known one pokes up and the other one is the

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.000
 Manarepas.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:39.720
 And read life through the Manarepas, how he started his life. So ordinary, so casual, so mundane

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:46.820
 status, but his courage and commitment, determination, devotion, and Bodhi jata, what did he become

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:47.000
?

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:55.620
 He said, you know, and not just that only them, one after another. And all that. One point the Man

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:01.400
arepa said to his student, he said, or they said to him, because when he reach, become such a great

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.000
 teacher and become all active state of his life,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 his students said, Jeju, they said, called Jeju. Jeju, we think, you are not just the only person,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:24.590
 you must be emanation of the Vedaya Dara, or the Buddha Shakyamuni, or someone else, otherwise you

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.000
 can't be like this.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:34.860
 He said, what a Manarepa asked. He said, oh, that's wonderful. Wonderful you have such a good

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.000
 devotion to me. So wonderful.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:47.100
 But however, according to the reality level, I began as the only person. And you know how I started

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:55.140
 my life with all those difficult struggles. And also I did so many so big, kind of like, un

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.000
righteous activities too.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:05.040
 Because of that, I wake up myself, I put courage in commitment, receive the teaching and put that

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:13.000
 into my heart and practice diligently for so many years. And that's why I become this.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 It's not that I born with Buddha, I born as the Vedaya Dara, but I born as the ordinary person and

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:30.190
 become that reason. That tells, if you put the effort and the devotions and both each other,

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:37.000
 everyone have that opportunity, everyone might think, going to think, oh, I might be someone else,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 or they will think.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:46.410
 It's true. So therefore, this Vedayana teaching is so powerful. And for this reason, for example,

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:52.810
 this visualization, always in the Vedaya Mahayana teaching, never mention in the Vedaya

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.000
 visualization teachings.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:55.630
 Except for some, you can visualize the Buddha right in front and think of the Buddha's person and

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:10.650
 meditate, but never taught in the Sukhara Mahayana to be yourself as Vedaya, as Buddha. Be yourself

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:12.000
 as the Vedaya Buddha.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.550
 For Vedayana, that Buddhahood, we are going to look for three countless eons that immediately we

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:26.000
 are transformed. We are in that status. We have become Buddha. We are in that status.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:37.480
 Therefore, in that aspect, Vedayana teaching is so powerful, immediately it is capturing the result

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:46.540
, the achievement of state. Immediately, the Buddhahood is achievement, goal, but will immediately

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.000
 be in that status.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:55.670
 And that is what one of the great, again, teachings of the Vedayanas. And now this Vedayana

00:06:55.670 --> 00:07:03.840
 teaching, as you say, divided into efforts, say, two seconds, two principle seconds, regularization

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:09.000
 of the creative states and the complete state or the dissolved state of the complete status.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:17.200
 Those are two principle practice. Have I summarized that all kind of like that more laboratory that

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:23.000
 in more kind of little bit more, more what is called, also sometimes called yogas.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:34.930
 In that way, these are the four yogas. The first yoga is the Bodhi, the emptiness appearance of the

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:42.000
 Bodhi meditation.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:52.490
 The second is the emptiness appearance yoga of the Bodhi meditation or yoga of the Bodhi meditation

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:56.000
 of the emptiness and appearance.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:06.050
 And the second is yoga of the emptiness, the sound of speech meditations. Third is yoga of clear

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:11.000
 light, luminosity, practices of meditation.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:20.040
 Fourth is all as indestructible primordial wisdom yoga meditations. So these are our four

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:24.000
 categories that have been followed.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 Now we begin with the first one is Bodhi of yoga of the Bodhi of the appearance, emptiness.
