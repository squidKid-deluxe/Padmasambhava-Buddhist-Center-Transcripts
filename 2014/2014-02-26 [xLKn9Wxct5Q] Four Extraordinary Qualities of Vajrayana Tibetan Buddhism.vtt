00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.160
 "In English, again, it is, and this is, I think, the 11th line, as you see, the 11th line, it is

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.640
 present.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:28.800
 The lama and the yadam are inseparably from one's own mind, mind, mind inseparable.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:40.280
 In the developing stages, meditate in all appearance to be as empty as moon,

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:48.640
 rough lacun, in the water." So that is the beginnings of the Vajrayana practices.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:56.160
 Vajrayana practice teaching is again generally known as bodhagi, many different levels of the

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.640
 teachings,

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.720
 which hold a little bit of background of the Vajrayana teachings, and many different levels.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:10.240
 Those teachings are as we heard, and I'll give you some talk of this as is then basically known as

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.480
 Hanyana teachings, all the basic Buddhism school teachings, and Mahayana teachings,

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:22.640
 and then Vajrayana teachings. So in that way, three different ways. And within the Vajrayana

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:23.600
 teaching,

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:30.320
 then there are also many categories. First, what means Vajrayana?

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:38.480
 Vajrayana is translated into English as diamond weaker, diamond weaker, weaker.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:50.250
 And diamond weaker is always in the teachings said, is more direct, more direct to get the

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.280
 realization,

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.840
 or to discover a true nature as it is, then the basic Buddhism school teachings,

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:04.880
 and the Sauter Mahayana teachings, it's more direct, more direct. And therefore, many great masters

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.880
,

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:14.720
 often use, say, I mean not just often, they said there is at least four different extraordinary

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:25.520
 specials or extra onlys of the Vajrayana teachings. First is, is, is specialist of the Vajrayana is

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.600
,

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:40.720
 is very clear clarity is special of the clarity. Second, extra only is more skilled women's,

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:50.080
 or more techniques. Third is, no difficulties, not hardships, part extra onlys.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:58.800
 Fourth is, practitioners all are highly culpability, highly culpability person, that is, port,

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:13.120
 port, extra onlys. So fourth is, more clarity. Clarity means what? Means the will, will

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:22.000
 is more clarity, more clay, and more, more, it's completely open. Will is open. The will,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.480
 that means nature is Buddha's teaching. For example, in Hinayana teaching, what Buddha

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:36.240
 give you, we all start. What meditation is known as egoless in the status. That is the egoless in

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:44.480
 the status. In Mahayana teaching, what is that? Above the egoless in the status, all this phenomena

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:54.800
 is empty. Phenomena is also empty of the solid existence. Not just the ego is solid, empty of the

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:05.280
 solid existing. All the phenomena is, the phenomena existing is empty of the solid existence.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:13.280
 That's what the Sattar Mahayana teaches. In Vaidyana teaching, not just only that,

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:22.800
 but it is totally great blissfulness. Great blissfulness. Of course, there is many different,

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.800
 again, levels of the Vaidyana teachings, has different ways to explain. But I'm talking about

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:38.640
 general meaning of this. So therefore, it's totally open. Nothing is left out in the Dzogki

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:45.360
 will, for example, Dzogki will, or the Vaidyana will. Nothing more discover than there is, nothing.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:54.000
 It's totally open. Therefore, it is known as totally open or unobscure. The will is totally,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:05.200
 not obscure, unobscure. The will is so perfect as it is. That is the extra ordinary college of the

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:15.840
 Vaidyana teachings. Second is, in the sense of Vaidyana teaching, in what in the Hinayana

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:16.560
 meditation,

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:23.680
 meditation or the basic Buddhist school in the Mahayana is known as the Shama meditation,

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:31.440
 Vipashana meditation, which is excellent and powerful, powerful practices, powerful practices.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:37.120
 But Vaidyana teaching has a variety of techniques to discover that true nature.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:45.040
 The school means many schools, many methods, methods used to speed up our realizations,

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:54.720
 such as then the Dzogki meditations, or such as Sa, Lung, Tomu meditations, so forth.

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:02.800
 So many school means, this again, each Vaidyana school, there's many, as you know, many different

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:08.320
 levels of outer tender in it, and they all have the different, but I'm talking on general scopes

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:15.760
 of the Vaidyana. There's more techniques, meditation levels. It's not just follow one or two,

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:24.320
 two techniques, follow. Techniques are totally open, totally open. There's nothing more

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:30.960
 techniques sophisticated than those to speed up our enlightenment.

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:40.160
 Therefore, this is very special. Those techniques, now those techniques, those moves,

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:50.800
 we really come, it's also not difficult, not hard. So the, so the wheel is totally open,

00:06:51.600 --> 00:07:00.400
 meditation technique is so rich, rich, therefore, conduct level, we need apply application level,

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:09.920
 then it is also become so easy, so, so easy, so casual, we don't have to play too much

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:17.520
 hardships, rules, those we have to do, as did in the basic Buddhist schools or the Mahayana

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:23.680
 teachings. Empathy in the Vaidyana teachings, we all heard that, and we read Largo Life Store

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:29.440
 great masters, many of those great beings, are totally very enlightened beings, using all the

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:35.840
 luxury items, every flag and so object is rich in enlightenment, such as always in the teaching,

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:40.720
 you said, examples of the King and their Buddhists. Also, that is Contrasong Deepti.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:49.760
 Contrasong Deepti is the ruler of the Tibetans. That time, he was the mostly powerful, powerful

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:58.640
 kings in the central ages, ruled every directions, territories, but yet, Contrasong Deepti become

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:07.120
 the enlightenment. Contrasong Deepti become as great scholars. He wrote many books that which is

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:13.360
 still in the dangerous sections of the Tibetan Buddhists, dangerous sections, wrote many books.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:20.720
 He read the enlightenment. He becomes one of the 900 students, and he emanates so many great

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:27.840
 thetums, one after another, and great masters, one after another, one after another in the Tibet,

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:33.600
 throughout the Tibetans. At the beginning, renowned one is, is Nyaranyama also, and Guru

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:40.720
 Chudyawabza, so forth. The last renowned one is Great Enchanted. The Great Enchanted that we go,

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:48.880
 Chancid. He was one of the renowned, renowned, the emanation of the Contrasong Deepti.

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:56.880
 This is how the Tibetan teachings have used, applied the purple ways, keep the view perfectly,

00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:03.680
 technique properly, and then, the reaching enlightenment is, in this case, the piece of

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:11.920
 case, the piece of case, in this case. If you really don't have techniques, read the style of the

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:18.400
 Contrasong Deepti, for example. There's many great masters, too. Great, great practitioners, too,

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:25.680
 that who enjoy it in the way, samsara situation, family lives, for example, great mama, the dance

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:32.560
 letters. He was householder. He was a late practitioner. He didn't know to the caves or any places,

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:39.440
 according to the lifestyle he spent in this, his own houses, taking care of, in a way, his family

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:47.680
 lives. And there's many, many others. And then the renowned one always used great masters,

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:53.600
 example, all in all, is taken in their Buddhist. And that was the time of the Buddha Shakyamuni's,

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:58.800
 and the teachings said that. And one time, okay, I mean, all these long stories, many of you heard

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:04.000
 and I heard too, but that's what I'm talking, talking that, that, and then one time, Buddha

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:11.650
 Shakyamuni, he invited, I'm back to short stories, he invited Buddha Shakyamuni with all the Latin

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:11.680
's,

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:18.640
 came to his course, and he was so moved by the Buddha. He must move by all that his disciples

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:26.080
 are others. And every time at the end, in Buddhism, that ancient time, in the Vinaya time, they do,

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:32.720
 I mean, the Buddha's time, maybe not too much in Tibet, but Sri Lanka and Thailand, they all do

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:38.240
 these things. It's all the written in the Buddha's teaching or the Vinayas, that after you offer

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:38.320
 the

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:46.000
 dinner or lunch, so not dinner, lunch, lunch, that, and then all that donor will come to the,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:53.120
 to the middle of the, the hall and sit on the floor with great respect and then ask,

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:59.440
 give teachings or give the Buddha, Buddha give the teachings. So he came, this king kind of

00:10:59.440 --> 00:10:59.840
 finished

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:07.920
 all those, he came and then he, with great respect, said, how I can get, as you got the realization

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:07.920
,

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:15.840
 he said, he came and everybody asked to, to Buddha, how I can get same realization as you got.

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:25.200
 Buddha said, then you should give up your kingdom and keep, keep, give up all your luxurious items,

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:33.360
 items, everything, and come with me, I will give the solution to you. I will give the answer.

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:45.600
 And he said, no way, Jose. I have no plans to give up all the luckiest items, everything,

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:54.000
 but being as heavy with all this, I like to get even, I like to get the same, every, you have

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:01.440
 something to me, tell me. Then Buddha immediately saw his capabilities, his readiness, capabilities

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:01.440
,

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:08.000
 that immediately he transformed, Buddha become not just a Buddha as like holding the graying

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:14.160
 balls, that, that, that instantly transformed according the teaching of the different schools,

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:19.680
 the new schools and old schools, and the new school's teachers said, instantly transformed

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:26.880
 Gohya Samadhi status, the famous Buddha, famous Stanford Buddhas, immediately Buddha transformed

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:33.120
 that status, and all the Arhathas who come there, they are no more Arhada, they all become the

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:40.560
 assembly mandala of the great Samadhi, Samadhyas, and he gave the teaching, he gave the other,

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:48.240
 were the other teachers. As he received the teaching, he practiced them, and the teaching

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:55.440
 said that within that lifetime, that in that Buddha himself, all the queens and kingdoms,

00:12:55.440 --> 00:13:03.440
 the assembly of everyone as, as group, they reach that enlightenment, they become enlightened

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:03.760
 within

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:11.200
 that lifetime. That is the, what the beauty of the Vadiyana teaches, so fast, so quick,

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:17.680
 so speed, and then of course, you know the ambient path is so fast, so quick,

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:27.920
 even in plot, the highway, diamond path is. In the country, there is called diamond path, I mean,

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:37.520
 you know, right? That is really speed, but you have to qualify it, that's the one. You have to

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:38.240
 qualify,

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:45.360
 that's the, of course, you said that. You have to qualify, if you qualify it, diamond path is speed

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:45.360
.

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:54.640
 That's how the Vadiyana teaching is, it's called diamond weaker, it's really diamond weaker.

00:13:54.640 --> 00:14:03.840
 That's it. So therefore, this, this is, therefore, the techniques and therefore,

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:10.640
 as the conduct level is not heart-shaped, difficult, it is very

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:22.160
 easy, commonness, have you applied the skill that, practically or properly, the techniques and the

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:30.480
 will use, and says that this is the special, and then qualification of the practice, will practice,

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:38.080
 they are all quite high capability practice, quite high capability, intelligence. To make this

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:44.880
 intelligence, to make ourselves that qualification, qualification is not just the reading on the

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:45.680
 stone,

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:51.600
 qualification is a mental attitude, in this case, it's not something out of feature that we have to

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:59.680
 change, qualification is our openness of the mind, our courage, our commitment, and our devotions,

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:08.400
 that is, we call it, that we can increase, because we all have the buddha nature, buddha nature is

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:15.280
 full up, fully kept, buddha nature is not outside, we're not talking outside, call it, we're

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:16.160
 talking

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:26.640
 each of our own nature of the mind, our own mind, nature of the mind, each of our own nature of

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:27.200
 mind

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:34.000
 is buddha nature, buddha nature has in the teachings, and it completed according to jokti

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:42.320
 teaching, it has all kayas and vistams, everything is complete, all kayas and vistams,

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:51.230
 those kayas, what that means, of course, also what you own, not kayas, dharmakaya, sambokaya, namak

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:51.520
aya,

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:58.400
 and sopavakaya, and also in some cases, if we do five, then it's called enlightened kayas,

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:09.040
 all is complete, all is complete in our support and in the seat, in our nature of the mind,

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:15.440
 your nature of the mind, this kaya is not just a kind of like, kaya, kaya means in a way a kind of

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:24.960
 forms, but form is not just form, object, it has all the intelligence, the vistams, smartness,

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:33.360
 smarts, all this, that is not in the buddha's teaching or in mayana teaching, in medhana teaching,

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:41.280
 the five vistams is completed, five vistams are completed, the dharmadattu vistams,

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:48.240
 medhala vistams, and equanimity vistams, discrimination, awareness vistams,

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:57.760
 the whole accomplished vistams, all are completed, exactly as as buddha shaktamuni has, as

00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:07.040
 gurupenma sambok has, we are not missing, not nothing is missing outside, it's all needed,

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:12.560
 and therefore when we receive the teaching of the vedayana, when we receive the teaching of the

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:13.360
 view,

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:23.280
 meditation, and the applications, our capability will grow, our capability opening, developing,

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:30.960
 is settling, activating, activating, therefore capability is not stopped, to open that

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:37.920
