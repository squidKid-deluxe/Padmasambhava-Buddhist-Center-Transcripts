00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.960
 Warm greetings, friends. Welcome back. So, as usual, we'll just begin with reconnecting

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:27.320
 to our motivation, this genuine, heartfelt love and compassion for all beings, this Bodhichitta.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.320
 We're taking this time to pay attention to what's vitally important in our lives. So

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.280
 we're going to temporarily put aside just kind of other things and create a little space,

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.360
 a little pause and time to be with the Buddha Dharma and to open our hearts to it and to

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.840
 kind of hone our attention on the Dharma and just let that kind of be the atmosphere we're

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.960
 going to be in here for a few minutes together. So we activate this Bodhichitta and then kind

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:00.440
 of relax into also this pure perception, as Rinpoche has talked about so many times, is

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:30.320
 a key point of Vajrayana practice. So we'll just do that for a moment.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:40.640
 Thank you. So this has been an interesting topic for me to consider this time. So I'd

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.560
 like to try to give myself a little bit of a kind of like sandbox to try to have to orient

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:53.440
 within for these really brief kind of Dharma talks. And so the title for this one, I just

00:01:53.440 --> 00:02:04.600
 kind of came up with is the easy path of Vajrayana, using limitations for liberation. So the easy

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:15.640
 path of Vajrayana Buddhism, how do we use limitations for enlightenment? And I was thinking

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:23.920
 this morning, shoveling manure and soil. And I thought to myself, day by day, kind of considering

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.040
 this topic, what makes Vajrayana the easy path? Because it's a statement that's really

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:36.520
 proclaimed far and wide in the lineage tradition. Vajrayana is the swift and easy path. And

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:47.440
 what I came to this morning is this topic for me is more like a love letters to Vajrayana.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:56.960
 Kind of like all the ways that I'm kind of dazzled by the exceptional, extraordinary

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:04.880
 qualities of Tibetan Buddhism and the little bit I know about it. So the topic today is

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.280
 kind of what makes this easy. In the past few kind of times, I've seemed to be like on

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:19.640
 a little bit of a cycle of giving warnings. Like, this requires us to really show up for

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.560
 Vajrayana practice and we have to keep going. And we have to keep checking in with ourselves

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.760
 and we have to be willing to receive feedback from other people and including and especially

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:37.520
 like a teacher or a guru that we're connected with. All the ways that we can't blame life

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:43.320
 for happening to us but we have to actually utilize life in order to flourish. So I've

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:51.880
 kind of been on a little bit of a trajectory of that flavor. And so I thought to mention

00:03:51.880 --> 00:04:05.000
 also just the beautiful bounty of Vajrayana too. And so this is more like a letter or

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.200
 like a, this is giving me some little space because this is more like poetry and less

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.640
 like a technical analysis. So I have my own kind of reflections and then I'll base it

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:25.600
 in like lineage text too. And some of what I'm going to say is maybe like unconventional

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:35.880
 but also really obvious in a certain view. So the easy path of Vajrayana. So I think

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:42.960
 I came to the point in my mind and I've come to it like again and again a bit. The point

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:56.080
 is one point is that Tibetan Buddhism has nothing to do with Tibet. I think this is

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:08.080
 like such a big point that is again and again proclaimed by lineage masters and Longchenpa

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:14.600
 in his, one of his seven treasuries, the treasury of philosophical systems. I think it's chapter

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:23.040
 one. He's going over the history of Buddhism and in that teaching by Longchenpa, he very

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:30.240
 clearly talks about how Vajrayana was fully taught by Buddhist acumeni in India before

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:36.360
 it went to Tibet. And if you look at his more subtle level history of Tibetan Buddhism in

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:43.280
 that same chapter, how the Buddha was enlightened a long time before he was enlightened in India

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:52.080
 eons ago and how then he turned the wheel of Dharma, Vajrayana Dharma. Just yesterday

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:59.760
 Venerable Kempa Ramache is talking about how Amitabha became enlightened 10 days ago. Buddha

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:05.800
 Amitabha was enlightened 10 days ago according to his time frame in Dehuachen and for human

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:16.720
 years that's 10,000 eons ago. So Vajrayana happened a long time before this world system,

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:23.840
 before Tibet, before India, before language here, before any artifacts we have, any empirical

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:29.560
 data we're going to get on it. There are just so many tantras and sutras that go over the

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:39.560
 vast, extensive cosmological history of Tibetan Buddhism with a lot of detail. So that said,

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:46.440
 somehow we have the incredible great fortune that the Buddha came at this time, some 600

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:53.640
 or so, or 2,500, 2,600 years ago. In India he turned the wheel of Dharma. Guru Rinpoche

00:06:53.640 --> 00:07:00.280
 appeared, manifested in India, took the full Vajrayana teachings to Tibet. That was firmly

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:05.560
 established by the great Dharma King Tristan Detsen, Shantrakshita and Guru Padmasambhava.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:10.400
 That's around the 8th century that it's been an uninterrupted living lineage that has not

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:20.940
 broken up until this very present moment and it's continuing with all these lineage masters.

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:29.580
 It's a big thing nowadays to try to find a transformative method that's really accessible,

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:35.160
 that's really human, that's really organic, that's totally scalable with so many big problems

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:42.200
 we have. How can humans make, how can we be friends, right? Get a lot of humans together,

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:46.200
 how do you get them to not kill each other when it's a lot of them? That is a problem

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:56.200
 that has been plaguing human civilization for millennia, but Tibet is an example of how

00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:05.840
 to do it. They were able to do this with Tibetan Buddhism in Tibet, Vajrayana coming into Tibet,

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:11.520
 all these decentralized hubs of nunneries and monasteries and look at how many enlightened

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:16.960
 beings Tibetan Buddhism produced in Tibet. There are so many that we know about, let

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:23.000
 alone the ones we don't know about or can't perceive ourselves. This entire culture became

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:31.880
 oriented around bodhicitta is the beginning, all beings have Buddha nature. The best thing

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:37.880
 someone can do in this life is get enlightenment so they can serve effectively all beings forever.

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:43.800
 That became like a cultural norm and of course Tibet is not a homogenous culture just like

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:52.920
 no culture is. All the Tibetan people aren't the same, they're just people. So just because

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:57.360
 we can take some lens and look at all this was wrong and that was wrong and this is wrong

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:01.880
 and that was wrong, that's great, you know, honestly that's really impressive. It's important

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:06.360
 to look at power dynamics and to see who has power and who doesn't, but that's the first

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:14.120
 noble truth. There's suffering, it's not all perfect. So we need to highlight suffering

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:17.680
 but then we can't forget there's a second noble truth, third noble truth, fourth noble

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:23.610
 truth too. Okay, so we can diagnose the situation as being very difficult in certain ways system

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:24.100
ically

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:30.680
 or just in little points, but so what do we do? What's the path? How can we prevent it?

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:35.880
 How can we heal it? How can we overcome it? How can we liberate this problem of suffering?

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:40.560
 The Buddha taught this so long ago and it's been taught way before our enlightened system

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:51.520
 or this system here, this world system. So Tibetan Buddhism has nothing to do with Tibet

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:57.640
 and yet Tibet should be honored with folded hands just like Mother India as a look at

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:01.640
 all these Tibetans that have done it, look at all these Indians that have done it, look

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:06.680
 at all these people from all around who've applied these teachings and gotten the fruit,

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:12.760
 re-achieved Bumis, like actually become liberated Aryan noble beings and let alone go through

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:17.360
 the Bumis, become fully awakened enlightened beings that will serve other beings perfectly

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:24.560
 for the rest of time and space. It's really well worth us like taking a humble position

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:30.520
 and saying, "Oh, how did they do this? How did this work?" And so that's kind of a point

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:36.600
 of what we're doing here. How does Tibetan Buddhism work? Like why is it worthy of respect?

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:51.720
 Why is it like, "How did it do this?" And let alone big claims of being the easy path.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:57.200
 Tibet produced all these enlightened beings and even if we don't believe enlightenment,

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:04.640
 which is a really funny idea for a Buddhist, if you don't believe in enlightenment and

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:10.360
 you're here, this is an interesting thing to consider how that's possible. But say we

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:20.160
 put that aside. What's the way we begin every session? Borichitta. What if that was a common

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:26.800
 human standard? Okay, before we say something, arouse Borichitta. Oh, before we learn something,

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:32.520
 arouse Borichitta. Before we make art, arouse Borichitta. Before we go to our job, arouse

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:40.480
 Borichitta. Think of how high level, how mature, like how amazing a technique for that to become

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:47.760
 a cultural norm. For us now to be trying to, we're reproducing that culture. We're in that.

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:51.800
 We're trying to hold ourselves accountable to that standard, such a high standard where

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:57.840
 really everyone is included, no one's left out. We can't put anyone on the side. Everyone

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:09.440
 has to be allowed in. No one will ever be left out. That's Sutra Mahayana. This is the heart

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:18.240
 of Tantra Mahayana. How amazing to just take a moment to pause and activate Borichitta in

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:23.760
 ourselves and all of a sudden things get a lot easier, don't they? They definitely do

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:33.320
 for me. Take a moment to pause. Reactivate compassion. Have more Borichitta come out.

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:39.600
 Really a deep, genuine love for beings. Just for a moment or two. I mean, it softens everything.

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:48.360
 Everything just kind of sets into place just a little bit, let alone have that be something

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:52.640
 we experience moment by moment, hour by hour, day by day, year by year. That's what we're

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:58.040
 all practicing for. That's what we're all studying, to be in the space of Borichitta

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:04.840
 all the time. That's what this whole path is about. If we can do that, then Vajrayana

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:21.080
 becomes easy. That's kind of point one. I think a separate point is, I think being

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:25.600
 able to use Tibetan Buddhism or Vajrayana requires many things in Rinpoche, Venerable

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:31.080
 Kenpo San Antonio Rinpoche, Rinpoche as well. They've gone over this list of what makes

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:36.720
 a qualified teacher and what makes a qualified student many, many times. And Jigme Lingpa

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:46.960
 is taught on it. I say their names quickly because the list is so long. All these noble

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:53.560
 beings taught on what, especially for us as students, what makes us appropriate vessels.

00:13:53.560 --> 00:14:03.720
 One way we can say that, what makes us ready? How do we ready ourselves for Vajrayana? And

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:08.440
 one thing I think is really simple, there's a few things, but that's really, really simple

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:18.320
 is open-mindedness. Maybe. Just that idea. Maybe. Could the Tibetan Buddhism have been

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:25.080
 taught before this world system happened? Maybe. For the Big Bang, maybe. Can we heal

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:33.920
 each other with light? Maybe. I don't know, maybe. Could bodhicitta arise this moment?

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:38.840
 Maybe. Because in Sutra Mahayana, they think it takes eons. That Buddha taught it takes

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:44.000
 a long time to have an actual authentic moment of bodhicitta. But in Tantra Mahayana, it

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:56.920
 says it can happen right now. Is that possible? Maybe. Could it be that I'm not a bad person?

00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:02.840
 Could it be that you're actually good? Could it be that the world's really workable? Could

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:08.000
 it be that Amitabha's pure land is in the West? Could it be that it's the easiest thing

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.920
 to get into Adewa Chen by offering a flower to the West with genuine intention and certainty

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:18.850
 please may all beings be reborn in circumstances that utterly flourish and support their

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:19.400
 enlightenment

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:27.600
 forever in Adewa Chen? Is that possible? Maybe. If our answer is not a pretty, loose, easy

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:36.680
 to happen, maybe, then we really need to look at that. Because Vajrayana really requires

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:47.640
 an open mind. There's a lotus on a bed of flames with a sun and a moon and forearms.

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:52.320
 And, I mean, if we don't consider this with a little flexibility of imaginative mind,

00:15:52.320 --> 00:16:10.840
 what are we doing? Maybe. Because it doesn't work without that. It just doesn't work. If

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:16.760
 we really come to Vajrayana and think, "I know how this works. I don't need to learn

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:26.040
 anything else." It just won't work. And it's even harder if we practice Vajrayana a long

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:29.960
 time and that's where we get to, "Oh, I know everything. I don't need to learn anything

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:37.960
 else. I'm done. I know it all." That's much more dangerous. They call it a leather bag

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:41.680
 that holds butter. It's soft on the inside but brittle on the outside. It's very easy

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:50.000
 to break. It becomes a poison vessel. We can't receive the nutrition of Dharma anymore because

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.800
 we just kept it up here and we didn't try to become it. And the more we do that, the

00:16:55.800 --> 00:17:00.400
 stronger the habit gets. The more impervious we become to receiving the Dharma to consider,

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:05.400
 "Oh, maybe. Maybe this is true. Maybe it's possible. Maybe enlightenment in a lifetime

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:14.760
 is possible. Maybe. Maybe all sounds arise as the mandala is like pure enlightened mantra.

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:20.640
 Maybe. Maybe I don't even have to say a mantra. The mantra is already there resounding, self-res

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:21.160
ounding,

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:25.840
 right? Because that's like what the teaching says we should try to do. Let the mantra be

00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:30.520
 there. We're not making it be there. We're just seeing, "Oh, it's there. Oh, I'll just

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:41.920
 allow it to be doing what it's doing and I won't get in its way." That's pure view. Maybe.

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:45.840
 Without that flexibility of mind, without really genuinely considering a much more of

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:53.960
 a both/and kind of perspective. Not this way, not that way. What is Madhyamaka all about?

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:58.480
 I mean, really, I'm throwing around some terms because sometimes it's good to just get into

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:08.100
 the meat of these things. What's Madhyamaka Middleweight teaching is all about? I mean,

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:13.880
 the Nogarjan has said, "The highest view is the one that grasps onto no view. Go beyond

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:24.040
 all views to not take a position with any kind of rigidity or fixation or false certainty.

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:31.840
 This is the way it is." Because Vajrayana is intentionally designed to completely destroy

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:39.280
 that. This is the way it is. Vajrayana is completely designed to uproot our duality

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:45.440
 clinging and we've heard it so many times and so any time it comes up a sense of, "I

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:50.880
 know this. I'm right. This is right," and then it gets tenser and our blood pressure

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:58.840
 goes up and we start pointing fingers. This is not a Madhyamaka view. So how could it

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:03.740
 be a Vajrayana view? Madhyamaka has to be included in Vajrayana. That's what all the

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:12.360
 teachers said. If we're really in the nature of mind, if someone's really abiding in flexible

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:21.040
 open awareness, how can you get into some big fight and be angry? If you're really in

00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:26.480
 it, because all the teachings on Vajrayana may being the easy path and there's a list

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:32.640
 of them. Venerable Kempa Rinpoche's, they talk about it in their Outer Tantra book.

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:38.760
 The 15 distinctions between the Sutrajana and the Tantrayana. They excerpt it from the

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:46.200
 Chakra-Zambara Tantra. They go through the 15 points that proclaim why Vajrayana is greater

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:53.440
 than Sutrajana and this is really key here. Not against Sutrajana. It's not either/or.

00:19:53.440 --> 00:20:02.440
 It's both/and. It's Sutrajana plus, just like it's foundational Buddhism plus and if really

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:09.400
 for all of us, if we've come to that point of understanding already, yes, we're learning.

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:15.320
 If we still think of Hanyanas against Mahayanas against Vajrayana, this is completely not

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:27.480
 a Dharma teaching. They're all unified together in the synthesis. So in these teachings, the

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:32.200
 15 distinctions between Sutrajana and Vajrayana, then they're distilled into the four condensed

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:41.920
 points of what makes Vajrayana so amazing and they all come down to directly recognizing

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:55.520
 the nature of mind. All of them. And I have no ability to say anything about that. But

00:20:55.520 --> 00:21:00.800
 they're living lineage masters that can and they do and they are and they're still here

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:06.380
 and we can connect to them and we can work with them. And there are these living teachings

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:13.680
 of Vajrayana that are exactly suitable to whatever we're ready for that will help us

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:21.320
 see our mind. What is our mind truly? The nature of our mind without all this fixation

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:26.760
 and hang ups and expectations and hopes and fears and aversions and all the things. That's

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:35.060
 just samsaric mind. So if we're really serious about Vajrayana, which I mean, you know, on

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:44.440
 occasion I am, most of the time I'm wasting my time. But in a moment of being serious

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:53.080
 about Vajrayana, then we really have to take that seriously. If it's possible, if maybe

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:58.960
 it's true the nature of mind is actually the way the Buddha taught about it. Being free

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:03.080
 and open. It's filled with bodhicitta. The simple way of saying it's just bodhicitta

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:13.760
 just come out. It's all the time it's bodhicitta, you know. If that could be true, that is the

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:20.560
 only thing that will liberate us from samsara. So many teachers teach on this. Toko Urjan

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:24.520
 Rinpoche has so many books on this. Shogya Omka Nourba Rinpoche has so many books on

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:29.800
 this. Ven. Rinpoche is in all of their books, they say the same thing. That's one of the

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:37.200
 qualities of Vajrayana. A distinction between Sutraana and Vajrayana is the cause. A cause

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:45.200
 has the same nature as a result. So instead of thinking that right now something's broken,

00:22:45.200 --> 00:23:01.800
 like in me, the result is already the same nature as the cause. If Buddha nature's true,

00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:06.160
 then enlightened nature, if Buddha nature is true, the enlightened nature is here and

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:14.520
 it's what I am, then I don't have to wait a long time to awaken it. It's already here.

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:24.200
 I just have to see it. We just have to recognize it. We just have to kind of look for ourselves.

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:32.060
 And then Vajrayana becomes easy. That's what we try to do at the beginning of every sadhana.

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:35.960
 It's what we're really encouraged to do. All these great masters, they're really not trying

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:40.320
 to just have us have repu, where we have all these repetitions and we've done all these

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:46.240
 things. It's trying to recognize our mind right now and again and again and again. And

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:50.400
 they're so kind that these great enlightened beings keep showing up and they keep doing

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:56.600
 things and giving us an opportunity to recognize the nature of my mind right now. Okay, so

00:23:56.600 --> 00:24:01.320
 say someone can do that for once, for a few minutes, for a few days. Then the teacher's

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:07.760
 going to come and say, "Can you do it now?" And they're going to do something. And it's

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:13.260
 going to activate something in us. "Oh no, I'm so bad. I'm the best. Oh no, what's going

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:21.640
 on? I'm confused." Right? People who've been around Vajrayana, they know this. And it's

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:29.360
 look now. That's what it is. Look now. Do you have an open mind now? Because when the moment

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:34.840
 of death comes or when big societal collapse comes and the big, all these really serious

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:40.120
 suffering things are happening, right? Obviously, personally in our lives and on bigger scales.

00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:46.280
 When those things come, look to the mind. And if we can do that, then all these other Vajrayana

00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:56.040
 claims become self-evident. Maybe. More than maybe. Probably. Oh, it's probably true that

00:24:56.040 --> 00:25:01.320
 the Buddha taught Vajrayana before even he was in India. It's probably true that I could

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:05.920
 get enlightenment in this single lifetime if I really put my mind to it. It's probably

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:13.040
 true. And we're trying to get this type of certainty, a really heartfelt conviction whereby

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:18.300
 looking really clearly and closely at our own minds and in our own habits and really

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:25.400
 again and again in the nature of our mind. Activate bodhicitta. Activate bodhicitta.

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:32.200
 We're trying to get this certainty that no matter what happens, we won't waver. We still

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:38.360
 will stay with our nature of bodhicitta. Absolute bodhicitta, relative bodhicitta in their union.

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:42.400
 We can call it so many things and these great masters did. According to the readiness of

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:47.520
 beings, whatever helps pop that light on for all these beings, they taught all these teachings,

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:53.760
 84,000 teachings. All different paths to just recognize the same thing are what is the nature

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:59.240
 of my mind right now. And then Vajrayana is one of its distinct points of being so easy.

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:08.200
 It's known as the path of skillful means. If the nature is already there in our minds,

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:14.000
 if the nature of everything is fundamentally good, fundamentally free beyond all categorization,

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:20.180
 beyond any way we want to chop it up and hold on for a reference system so we can feel comforted,

00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:27.960
 if the nature is already actually open, then we can use anything to reconnect to that nature.

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:34.680
 We can use the internet, we can use food, we can use making money, losing money, getting

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:43.160
 happy, sunshine, internet fails, no water doesn't turn on, tap, no electricity, Netflix

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:58.680
 down, sickness, old age, death. The range of skillful means is so incredible for Vajrayana

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:04.160
 because in Sutra Mahayana the view is already taught by the Buddha in Sutra Mahayana, it's

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:11.240
 great Madhyamaka going beyond all conceptual designations in any fixation on there being

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:19.760
 an inherent existence. The simple way to put this is everything changes, literally everything,

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:27.400
 all minds, all material, all felt sense of self, all felt sense of other, it all changes

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:35.040
 all the time, it's fundamentally illusory. The Buddha taught that in the Sutra Mahayana.

00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:41.600
 There's all these additional techniques the Buddha taught as Garimbice, and it's all these

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:50.000
 great beings with Tantra Mahayana, the soak ceremony that we do regularly, reciting mantras,

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.740
 dedicating a portion of money we make for Dharma activities so that our profession can

00:27:54.740 --> 00:28:01.200
 always be looped into a Dharma activity, put five dollars away every week just to sponsor

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:05.680
 someone for a retreat or something. Then your whole career becomes a Dharma activity, rejoicing

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:12.780
 in other beings happiness, rejoicing in the good things we do, confessing having bi-weekly

00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:17.680
 confessions of the mistakes we make and forgiving each other. These Sangha ceremonies on the

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:21.520
 tenth and twenty-fifth days, all these skillful means are available to reconnect to our nature

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:33.080
 of mind and that and others. It becomes so easy. We don't have to fixate so much on what

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:41.400
 to accept and what to reject, but it comes down to the point of actually nature of mind.

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:47.620
 So if we take this seriously, there's these living masters that can help us see that and

00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:52.280
 not just see it but get more familiar with it and not just get kind of familiar, become

00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:59.960
 really certain about it, rain or shine. Whether we're on our first prostration or our hundred

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:05.080
 thousandth prostration or whether something just someone just said something shocking

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:10.200
 or someone just said something so loving, then we're trying to keep connecting to this

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:23.000
 nature. That's the path. It's really the practice. And that's all we'll just keep doing it and

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.400
 these great we have such a great fortune. These masters will keep using all the skillful

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:34.680
 means available. Mundane ones, lineage ones, you know, traditional ones, really unexpected

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:41.000
 ones and they'll keep introducing us that, oh, we're, you know, just like a mirror, right?

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:57.160
 You're fundamentally good. All that is so interesting comes to mind this idea of acceptance.

00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:00.560
 So many people, there's so many near death stories. It's so interesting. This is popping

00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:06.800
 in my mind right now. There's so many near death experiences. And a lot of people come

00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:11.160
 back and they really just really they come back in a hospital situation without going

00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:17.600
 into all these details. They come back and they say so many similar things. And one of

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:24.480
 the similar things that a lot of people report is, is the first time I felt really accepted.

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:33.200
 They're dying, dead. Somehow there's some experience of like just being seen fully and

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:43.880
 without any manipulation or any, any judgments, just full acceptance. And it's really similar

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:50.200
 what we're trying to do in Badriana. This is our nature. I fully accept it. This is

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:55.480
 your nature. I fully accept it. That's where I'm going to begin every moment. See you as

00:30:55.480 --> 00:31:00.320
 a Buddha, see me as a Buddha. And if we have to fake it to make it and take little steps

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:05.560
 and think a Buddha and like try to visualize and make all these additional skillful means

00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:11.920
 to orient our minds so that we can relax and just accept that fact, that the Buddha nature

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:20.040
 is already there, then we use whatever we can. That's the path. But the path is the

00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:25.320
 path and the result is the result. And the path is the skillful means and the result

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:33.600
 is actually being in our nature. That's the principle point, which is a really key point.

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:38.760
 The point of Buddhism is not to stay on the path. The point of Buddhism is to realize

00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:48.120
 the result and the result is realized by whatever path gets you there. And the easiest, quickest,

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:53.720
 most lightning fast view is you're already there because the nature of the cause and

00:31:53.720 --> 00:32:00.000
 the result is both emptiness, lack of inherent existence and beyond all conceptual designation.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.600
 And just saying that and just repeating the words or something, that's easy. Anyone can

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:13.120
 do it, an AI robot can do it. But actually abiding in Borichitta, then we're in the result

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:20.960
 right now and then it's not in the path. Then we're in the fruition and then if our recognition

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:28.040
 kind of closes and stops, then we use a skillful means to reconnect. The moment we think we're

00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:36.160
 not enlightened, we create the need for a path because we don't see truly, we don't see the

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:42.000
 fact of the matter that that's the enlightened nature. We don't see it, so ignorance happens

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.640
 and then we need a path to re-recognize the skillful means path. And Balcherana has so

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:54.000
 many skillful means. It's a function of our own occluded seeing that we can't yet reveal.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:59.840
 We can't disclose our nature right now. So we need all these techniques and Vajrayana

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:06.640
 is filled with techniques. So the great master of Amalamitra, also he taught that one, Vajrayana

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:11.040
 is so incredible and extraordinary because there's so many skillful means, which I very

00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:18.960
 kind of casually threw things out in like a very random list. And two, instead of believing

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:25.520
 that we're broken, we can actually use our destructive emotions for what they are, that

00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:31.320
 energetic expression of our mind. We don't have to see them as enemies to get rid of.

00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:37.720
 We actually can use them. That's like poison as medicine, right? This is very typical Vajrayana

00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:44.360
 view. Then three, it's easy because we don't have to give up the luxuries of the six sense

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:50.860
 pleasures from the Vajrayana view. We can use them like food offering. We eat food and

00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:59.840
 make a Ganachakra offering as we eat. And so there's so much merit involved in that practice.

00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:05.480
 And then four, it's so swift. Let's say, Balamitra said, and this isn't from the clear lamp,

00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:10.480
 his teaching called the clear lamp. It's so swift because if we recognize our nature right

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:21.640
 now, then the path is already, it's instantly done. We're at the result. And then we keep

00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:26.840
 reintroducing that to ourselves every day with Sadhna practice, doing, going for refuge, generating

00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:31.360
 bodhicitta, doing our nandra sessions, doing whatever practices we're working. All we're

00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:39.440
 doing is reintroducing what a teacher already showed us in us. We're just reintroducing it.

00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:43.440
 And then we check in with a teacher. If we get confused or lost or like kind of the thrill

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:49.240
 is gone, you know, and we can't kind of see clearly, then a teacher so kindly will help

00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:54.800
 us see it again. They'll fully accept our nature as we, in all this human baggage that

00:34:54.800 --> 00:35:01.520
 we come with, which is beautiful. They're not going to throw out all the ways we show

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:13.940
 up as human beings. They're going to use that because they're great Vajrayana masters. So,

00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:22.520
 I mean, from my own mind, when I hear, oh, this is, Vajrayana is the easy path, then

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:26.760
 the doubt can really come up, you know? What do you mean easy? I've put some years into

00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:31.280
 this. It's really hard. All this, get this sickness and have to keep doing the things

00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:41.840
 and struggling, struggling, all these things. So then it's like, well, how is it easy path?

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:47.760
 Then we can't miss these key points. We can't because we just waste a lot of time and then

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:53.280
 a life will go, you know? We have to get really familiar with them. We really do. I mean,

00:35:53.280 --> 00:36:00.120
 this is a practitioner, so we can really help serve other beings. I'm, like, throwing some

00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:04.920
 words around, like, very casually in one way. But in another way, a lot of this is really

00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:10.880
 technical. All this, I'm saying, really is a union of rangtong, shantong and zogchen

00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:16.680
 perspectives taught by Mipham Rinpoche. I'm not trying to break down all the analysis

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:22.460
 of how it's empty of, like, ego fixation and empty of the adventitious obscurations and

00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:27.680
 totally full with all the perfected qualities already accomplished spontaneously right now.

00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:33.580
 But if we really look at these teachings, we can go into the depths and really technically

00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:40.280
 pick this stuff apart as a rangtong, shantong and zogchen, mahamudra unions. And I've said

00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:43.800
 it all, you know, and these great masters, they've said this so many times, all these

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:48.880
 things, but we have to make more familiar with these maps and then also with our own

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:55.780
 direct personal experience. But just as Vajrayana is just this giant kind of display of using

00:36:55.780 --> 00:37:02.720
 all of experience as the path to reintroduce the nature, it can be, it makes sense that

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:06.120
 we get lost sometimes, or it's confusing, it's overwhelming, it's just so much. How

00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:12.240
 do we fit all this together? The principle point really comes down to nature of mind.

00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:18.960
 So we really should come back to that as much as we can. Find a teacher, a living teacher,

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:27.640
 a living teacher with lineage. And then really genuinely ask them, what can I do to do this?

00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:34.220
 How can I make myself ready to actually recognize this? If this is true, if it's possible that

00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:40.360
 my nature could be enlightened, what can I do? And that teacher, that's all they want

00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:47.880
 to do is help beings, they'll help you. And even if it doesn't make sense so clearly,

00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:53.280
 or it's not, they'll help us learn to stand on our own two feet, where we don't depend

00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:58.600
 on all these things to feel happy. They say not so sensitive like a blade of grass in

00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:05.960
 the wind, just moves here and there, sunshine, happy, you know, rainy, sad. Like Longchampa

00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:10.600
 again said, Oh, when we're, you know, on the beach hanging out, you know, we're great practitioners

00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:10.760
,

00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:17.100
 but when something goes wrong, then we're not practitioners at all. The nature of mind

00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:21.600
 is the same in all these cases. So I'm not saying that because I recognize that because

00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:27.160
 I'm in no way claiming that. But sitting here at the feet of great noble beings of Venerable

00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:31.040
 Camperum, which is they're saying this again and again and again and again and again, pick

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:37.160
 up one of their books, these unrestricted books, they introduce it again and again and again

00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:45.640
 almost every chapter. So this is really like kind of an interesting time. The seal is kind

00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:50.400
 of broken on this. Like there's so many techniques for us to recognize this. There's so much

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:54.760
 study. There's so many living teachers. There's so much we can do to support if we're really

00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:59.320
 curious and open minded about this possibility of maybe I'm enlightened already. Maybe this

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:04.480
 nature is enlightened. Maybe you have enlightened nature. There is so much that would support

00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:09.800
 that inquiry and that adventure right now. We're really in this time where everything

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:15.440
 is at our disposal. And once these teachings of the Buddha Shakyamuni conclude, like after

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:21.060
 he said about 5,000 or so years, for all the next Buddha's of this fortunate Aeon, the

00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:29.040
 next 996 Buddhas, they won't say a single word about Vajrayana publicly. So we have

00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:37.240
 some 2,400 years left where we can actually make this a living experience and use these

00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:42.880
 teachings to really get realization and like really get acceptance and certainty that this

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:49.240
 is our nature. This is the nature of all experience. It's fundamentally good. It is open and it's

00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:54.040
 creative. It is loving and it's caring and it's fully embraced and inclusive in all ways

00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:59.440
 beyond any conception we could have about it is Buddha nature. So we're in this kind

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:04.960
 of amazingly fragile, very small window in cosmological time to receive these teachings

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:11.120
 and to get together and practice them all together. It almost never happens. It happens

00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:16.600
 in Daewa Chin every day, every moment, but I'm not in Daewa Chin yet. I'm really praying

00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:35.100
 to get there. But right now, it's all up for us. Everything is in our favor. That's it.

00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:39.800
 I'm trying to list some key things that have helped me over the years kind of stay on track

00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:44.060
 a little bit and I'm still not on track, I would say, but like to help kind of avoid

00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:48.140
 some things or kind of get, you know, get myself out of the ditch in some ways like

00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:55.640
 Tibetan Buddhism really isn't about Tibet. And at the same time, homage to Tibet, homage

00:40:55.640 --> 00:41:01.840
 to any mother India, homage to this stainless noble lineage of masters. Without them, we

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:09.500
 would be lost as Vajrayana practitioners because we're just not ready to see the teachings

00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:13.400
 that are always happening all the time. We're not ready. We're not clear enough to see it

00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:18.720
 happening all the time. So I'm going to last point. As a secular approach, what does this

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:29.760
 sound like, you know? What is omniscience in a secular language? When we experience things,

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:41.520
 there's no noise. It's all signal. Everything is an avenue towards awakening. It's not like,

00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:46.920
 oh, big samsara, all these crazy things. Where's the truth? How do I make sense? What am I

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:54.400
 doing next? Where's the signal? From a Tibetan Buddhist perspective, everything is telling

00:41:54.400 --> 00:42:00.360
 us to wake up. Every experience, every emotion, everything that we hear, any thought that

00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:10.480
 we have, it is all only signal. There is no noise. The Buddha said they looked throughout

00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:17.960
 all of cosmic universes and they couldn't find a single speck of suffering. It's all

00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:25.400
 only pure. It is all perfect signal. Then the question is making ourselves ready to actually,

00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:32.760
 are we willing to consider that possibility? This is all awakened experience, all of body,

00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:37.520
 speech, and mind, all form, sound, and space, all thoughts, all emotions. They all are the

00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:43.440
 enlightened nature because this is where Vajrayana Buddhism begins.

00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:49.400
 As a point, I wanted to highlight really for myself and then hopefully that's helpful.

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:54.440
 This is totally doable. These living masters are here and we're so fortunate to be a part

00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:59.640
 of these living lineages and these terma traditions and kama traditions that are still being turned

00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:05.160
 in this very moment with our own experience and also with these great living beings. I

00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:10.120
 know I'm kind of bouncing around in my love letter to Vajrayana Buddhism, but sometimes

00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:20.040
 it's good to just be in the soupy mix of love. I'm okay with that. I like that. I like that.

00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:25.760
 In fact, all these great masters, we look at them. What do we see in them? Do you ever

00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:29.520
 have that thing when you're like a kid and you see someone come in the room, you see

00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:34.320
 something and someone they're like, they sparkle, right? They're like, have this shine like,

00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:40.920
 "Oh, this person, they know something." They really come with some and these great masters,

00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:49.640
 they help us see what's going on there. Ooh, and we look and they help us see it in ourselves.

00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:53.880
 So this is like a love letter to the world and all of Vajrayana practitioners and all

00:43:53.880 --> 00:44:01.880
 sentient beings. We all have this nature, so there's no discrimination. These are such

00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:06.600
 standard lineage teachings, so I hope I'm not in any way trespassing or saying something

00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:13.920
 incorrectly. So check me. If this is not according to the lineage something, please check me

00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:19.040
 because I don't want to deviate from the lineage teachings. So thank you. Love you. Love you

00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:48.640
 all. Enjoy. Thank you. Thank you. Can I make a little clarification too about something

00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:53.560
 I said? I don't want to be misinterpreted. So in the point where I was talking about

00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:58.280
 how Tibetan Buddhism fundamentally has nothing to do with Tibet because the Buddha taught

00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:10.520
 that long before Vajrayana went to Tibet that at the same time, Tibet, we all owe an incredible

00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:15.480
 debt, like an unrepayable debt of kindness to all the Tibetans and the Tibetan Buddhist

00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:22.280
 masters that have preserved Vajrayana teachings, ongoing for centuries through today and into

00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:30.200
 the future. Of all the cultures, they created a culture where their streams were designed

00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:36.400
 to produce prayers and their wind was designed to produce prayers with prayer flags. And

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:42.440
 most of their economy went to libraries and educational institutions and art projects,

00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:49.600
 painting deities, and it's a non-theistic tradition that how much resilience the Tibetans

00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:58.340
 have to forgive beings in the face of incredible tragedy, how much they intentionally left

00:45:58.340 --> 00:46:04.480
 valuable resources in the earth to maintain earth balance, the literal, the incredible

00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:13.840
 literacy rates of Tibetans for centuries. It's such a fundamentally disarmed, nonviolent

00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:21.680
 culture as cultures go. And to have bodhichitta be at the center of their culture, that's

00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:29.300
 the normative line for Tibet, bodhichitta. We owe them, it's such an incredible repository

00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:35.260
 of living lineage wisdom where they honor their elders, they dedicated so much time

00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:42.040
 to preserving centuries of tradition in informed ways that could actually benefit their people

00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:50.040
 right now on the ground. So I just don't want that to be misconstrued. It's like a living

00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:57.520
 repository of all these insights and technologies of how we can create cultures and also help

00:46:57.520 --> 00:47:03.360
 nourish current cultures all around the world to actually do something like that that Tibet

00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:10.200
 has done. So that's it. That's really important to say too. So sorry, I don't want that to

00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:14.800
 be not clear. Thank you, sorry. Thank you. Bye.
