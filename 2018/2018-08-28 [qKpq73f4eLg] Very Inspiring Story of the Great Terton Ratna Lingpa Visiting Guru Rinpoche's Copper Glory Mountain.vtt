00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.800
 Is it his own story? Yeah, he's part of his bible. He's his term. And that is now is actually what

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:15.360
 all these thetans every thetans that you know when you read the life story of the thetans

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.440
 they really goes to the period of the Copper Glory Mountain, Guru Rinpoche period around

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:28.240
 at least one time, times. And mostly it is a time in the dreams or the vegans of course,

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:35.040
 dreams and vegans, that every thetans. So it's very fascinating, fascinating and I just like to

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:48.960
 read that to you and tell you that. So this is now Ratna Lingpa and he said he was a good now

00:00:51.680 --> 00:01:02.880
 and so he discovered the Terma teaching at 30s. At 37 he has obstacles in his lives, lives that was

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:15.280
 said in the professors or in the predictions in at 37s. And so I should do some more practices

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:27.920
 meditation. So he's doing retreat for one year during that time and so well he's in a in a in a

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:38.560
 that this is doing retreat and he has a dream in the 10th day night, night the dream and

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:51.840
 part beautiful girls with the bone ornaments came to me. To me they all said let's go to the

00:01:51.840 --> 00:02:00.560
 sung area. The sung area is a Tibetan area and sung. It is all the same Tibetan but the

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:09.840
 none of us was born in the wood. So they said, let's go to the sung areas. There you have large

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:18.480
 length beneficial activities to do. And you don't have much beneficial activities in here,

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:29.760
 let's go there. And I said, I have not completed my teaching so what I have to do here. So I want

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.240
 to

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:43.120
 go for three years. I won't go for three years. And then they said, okay, noble son, this year

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:49.520
 you have some obstacles so therefore you should practice. And afterward you should do then more

00:02:49.520 --> 00:03:00.080
 beneficial activities. That's correct. So he dreamed that, that night. Then again at that same

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:10.640
 must be same night and another beautiful lady came with him with his ribbon shorts. Okay and

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:20.800
 with him, with him, with the dhammaru and the bells. And they also said, here you don't have

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:30.160
 much really beneficial activities. Why we don't go to the west? West, west. All goes, go some other

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:41.760
 areas. Why you go here? And so he had that. And then he thought, am I really die for a few years?

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:48.640
 Yes, I have to do a lot of this beneficial activity to fulfill my obligation. Then I will go to the

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:55.910
 building or some of them. But I still not completed everything what I have to do, do of these lives

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920
.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:08.560
 So I won't go. And then you should do, so that's what he thought. And again, that must be

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:15.840
 again that night. Night. Then maybe that midnight or that latter night. That latter of that night.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:26.800
 And so I did a lot of again praise, praise, praise. And then that moment, well I'm praying,

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:34.720
 there's prayer class, which is moved by the wind, wind. And then the wind of fragrance came, came,

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:45.200
 came. And then that moment in the southwest direction, I looked up in the sky.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:53.840
 There's a young boy, looks like an earlier old boy, really born on a man and holding

00:04:53.840 --> 00:05:03.200
 Kathanga, the trident underneath the arm. And with Dhammaru and Bill, he's dancing.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:13.920
 And together there's many ladies with born on a man's, again they are holding big ribbons

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:21.600
 that which has long, has like two elbow sides, long sides. And they are kind of playing that

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:28.480
 in the sky. Those ribbons are pluming in the sky, kind of just like, like this. Plucking, plucking,

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:37.120
 plucking that. And everyone doing kind of different, different dancing. Dancing moves like,

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:44.880
 when I kind of see these. That moment I was kind of, remember, strongly of the Gurbel Masambhala,

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:53.360
 Gurbel Masambhala, in my devotions it becomes so strong, strong. I said, kind of, I made strong

00:05:53.360 --> 00:06:00.080
 prayers, strong prayers and strong meditation. Kind of feel that we're tired and then I fall asleep

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.160
,

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:09.920
 fall asleep. And when I fall asleep, sleep, sleep. And again in the sky of the west,

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:17.600
 west skies, there's a beautiful sound of the bell and a Dhammaru king. And now he's sleeping,

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:24.960
 he's in a dream, dream. And there are also some, what's called whistles, whistles king.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:35.920
 And there is another beautiful lady, young girl. Five of them with the born on a man, with ribbons

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:42.400
 and with tassels and kind of, as a dancing tourist king. He said, they all came to him,

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:51.120
 all noble yogi. Noble yogi, why you're so kind of yearning or calling to that, calling to Guru

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:56.560
 Mooji. Have you really missed too much, Guru Mooji? Let's go to Gurbel Masambhala Beole Land.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:04.400
 And they are having, now in the Beole Land of Gurbel Masambhala, they have big, big ceremonies

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:14.480
 of the three root, Guru Deva and Dakini ceremony. So we actually come to call you brother to come,

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:22.800
 to come there. And extend or activate your realization. Let's go together,

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:31.920
 together. When this is that, I can't remember the privilege, the privilege that he's,

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:38.640
 the other day that when he's made the first time in Gurbel Masambhala, that he's hoping that 11

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:45.360
 activities of Gurbel Masambhala's story, life story of the 11 activities of Gurbel Masambhala.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:51.840
 He's hoping that day, Guru Mooji, he can't remember or he went to the Beole Land of the

00:07:51.840 --> 00:08:00.160
 Gurbel Masambhala. Some of them. So he can't remember that. But he said that when Guru

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:05.200
 Gurbel Masambhala went to the Beole Land of Gurbel Masambhala, he went kind of a bit

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:11.040
 long, long, understand the difficult way. So I thought, I won't go now. He thought, I think,

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:19.680
 thought, I won't go now. And every, ever I go there, you have easy method that I can reach

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:27.280
 there easily. He said, I can reach easily there. And there is one girl that which is white girl,

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:36.080
 white color, white girl, he pulled out from his head pocket, pocket, white scarf, white scarf the

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:46.240
 size of the one elbow, one elbow and to the length is about three, three length of the fingers or

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:46.480
 this

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:55.600
 finger one. Five inches or so, that means about 15 inches or 16 inches. And it, so he pulled and

00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:04.470
 two, two, two other girls, the two, two girls that hold the other side, the scarf, piece, you sit

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:04.640
 here

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:11.830
 there and do the practices and some kind of dancing activity, if you didn't miss it though, you

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:12.080
 should

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:19.360
 do those. And then you will reach through in front of Gurbel Masambhala very easily, easily, and

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:19.680
 they

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:28.880
 give him dirty and terrible, very dirty. So the four sides, Dakini, these four ladies, are left up

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:37.120
 his scarf. And they all left up in the sky, feel that he's living in the sky. They all dancing,

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:46.880
 dancing, dancing with the seven branch accumulation prayer, they're kind of joining that in the

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:47.200
 left

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:56.160
 up the sky. And I'm praying, I bring seven line prayers and three, Kaya prayer of the llamas,

00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:03.600
 I pray. So then now he left in the sky. And then when you kind of left in the sky, he saw

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:10.640
 above the sky, when he looked, he looked at the earth, he saw the Shambhana, which is in Nepal,

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:16.730
 very famous stupa, you see. They kind of said, oh, this is a beautiful stupa, that actually, all

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:16.960
 these

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:22.880
 symptoms really, when they went, I kind of read many times, had similar things. They left it up in

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:29.280
 the sky. And then Dakini's Italian, all these see this, they don't see the kind of different places

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:29.280
,

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:35.120
 the holy places in Nepal, in India, and all that. And they all went to the south west.

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:44.960
 West, that's so here. They saw this Shambhana, and there's a beautiful stupa, and as well as many

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:53.200
 other beautiful stupa. He saw the whole area of the Kathmandu, Kathu areas. And then went far away,

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:59.280
 and then he saw continually, they were walking for the west, southwest directions, southwest

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:06.240
 directions. And then he saw the Asura caves, southern Asura caves. And there's also,

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:14.000
 Asura caves is where the Murpema Sambhar practice, the meditator, where the guy practices. So this

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 is

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.120
 where there is really still beautiful hand practice, we see. And some say this hand

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:24.080
 practice in Murpema Sambhar, and some say it's maybe some other great masters, but whoever,

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:30.800
 it's very famous place. We saw that. And then he's continually moving now, moving. And then he said

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:38.640
 there's a beautiful Chudribas he saw, and Bhidwa there is a beautiful also big temples and stupas.

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:44.080
 And these ladies said, oh this is the Buddha guy, and they're making a lot of kind of great

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:44.480
 offerings

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:52.560
 to the guy. And I also met offering grace to them. And then went and went, so I went kind of really

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:52.560
,

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:57.120
 and then he said all the different things, one after another. So I went to the, from the

00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:03.200
 manipulations, then they reached above the Odhayana, and they said this is the Odhayana,

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:10.800
 and then they went, and there's a beautiful now ocean. Ocean is just looks like sky, it looks like.

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:17.920
 And the father, beyond the ocean, then he saw this red capo glory mountain places. He said this is,

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:24.720
 and he thought this is now another capo glory mountains. Maybe we have to come down onto this

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:32.720
 place or land down, landing on these places. And then in my heart, then I have thought maybe I

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:38.320
 now can go back to Tibet. Tibet, he kind of feel a little bit funny about that. Maybe I cannot go

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:45.360
 back to Tibet now. And then this lady said, brother, you don't have to be sad so much. This

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:51.280
 is now you're really approaching to the capo glory mountain. Look to this, this, and this, and that

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:51.280
,

00:12:51.280 --> 00:13:00.240
 they again showed many places. And then they reached to the capo glory mountains, and again there's

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:07.510
 a lot of land formations and beautiful places, and also practical places, one after another this.

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:08.240
 And

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:16.240
 these rocky mountains are like so steep and sharp, and standing up the top, and so many places, one

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:24.240
 after another, all that places. And then that when they arrived there, and then all those ladies

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:33.760
 are kind of like, they will come down to the ground, and they drop the holding the scarf,

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:42.960
 that they drop it, and they said, now you sit here. So then they sit or they stop their short time.

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:51.360
 And that moment, not on the on the scarf, now somehow they kind of lift up as the bird,

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.680
 and there is in the middle of the, this is all the drill them down,

00:13:55.680 --> 00:14:03.360
 and there's beautiful stupa, stupa, and there is now many beautiful flowers, and big flowers,

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:09.200
 and there is then the temple of the three, three Buddha, such as Avalokudishevara,

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:16.240
 Jayasay, Avalokudishevara, Manjushri, and Vayayaparnas. And so, and

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:28.400
 then they completed that one lady, lady who pulled out that scarf, for all, she pulled by that

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:29.120
 scarf,

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:35.200
 and she put that in the pockets. And then they went there, for the walk forward, there is beautiful

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:45.520
 crystal, bold, big border, where they also put footprint of the Gurbama symbols. And then, and

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:56.400
 they said, and then, now you should circle and balance it to this temple of simplicity.

00:14:56.400 --> 00:15:04.000
 When you go back to Tibet, you should write down all this experience, and what you saw is

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:12.880
 good for your future disciples, and your students, good, and should write that, so that they said

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:18.320
 that. But then they went all the, take different locations, different places, one after another,

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:25.760
 maybe so many, just beautiful things. And so that really beautiful sight, seeing,

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:32.480
 tools, everywhere, they went, manipulations to that. And now finally, they come back, kind of came

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:40.400
 to the very beautiful, what's called, boundary walls, beautiful boundary walls. And that is the

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:48.240
 situation there is, then, the throne of Gurbama symbol, Gurbama symbol. In that, when they entered

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:56.960
 nearby there, is one beautiful young lady, lady, about a 16-year-old, old, and she is white,

00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:06.560
 with the red edges, and wearing all the beautiful ornaments, such as gold, turquoise, and, and the

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:36.400
 happy. Let's go inside. And so, when she said that, and he couldn't recognize her, and he asked,

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:46.480
 he asked, who are you? Who are you? And she asked, you don't recognize me? And, and I am, and

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:46.880

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:09.360

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:47.840
 so many are lined up this, and then Yachim Todja asked him over here, said, Yachim Todja asked me

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:56.000
 to come to sit with him, so I came to stay with him, here with that. And they did big ceremonies,

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:04.720
 big ceremonies, big ceremonies, and then they did and feel that they did ceremony about 21 days,

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:11.520
 this. And then they all the detailed ceremony, involvement, everything is so detailed, and

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:17.680
 everything that Murpema Maasambhav told, Murpema Maasambhav said, there are so many things I couldn

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:17.760
't

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:26.560
 write down here, that's what they said, and give empowerment, and the teachings, everything's that.

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:32.480
 So those all, and then they give lot of empowerment, teachings, and see all the Buddhas, such as

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:40.960
 Buddha Amitabha, Avaloknishvara, Hayangirva, Thara, and Vedayogini, everyone, all that this is,

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:47.120
 and in the mandala, all, one after another, and this again, so many beautiful, really displaced

00:25:47.120 --> 00:26:01.360
 explanations. And then that, and so, and then he just, and then they had beautiful, again,

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:10.000
 ceremony, beautiful fruit, beautiful flowers, beautiful food, and then among that, and that

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:17.920
 one lady who came, or the girls who came with a white hand, and five girls, one of them came,

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:25.190
 came to me and gave me three prutas. Prutas, and I add that, it's just so delicious, I can't

00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:25.680
 explain

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:32.240
 how delicious it is. And then there's so many, also these men and females of the cannibals are

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:38.320
 receiving the teachings, and so many dakinis are dancing, and this beautiful stadium, there's so

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:45.040
 many beautiful flowers, flowers, and dancing, and having the big kind of parties, celebrations,

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:51.360
 briefings, so this is just, everything is just one after another, all that.

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:58.150
 And then now, so then, and we talked about all, there's so many, again, things, I'm not really

00:26:58.150 --> 00:26:58.640
 going

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:03.760
 through all that, but finally, Gautam and Masambha said, in Sri Arundel, Sri Arundel,

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:14.080
 listen, noble son, this year you have some bumpy, your life has some difficulty, but now is removed

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:14.080
,

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:21.360
 you should keep every teaching and practicing as you received. Among that, the hard practice of the

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:29.200
 two dakas, that is the my hard practices, and that is the trail of the Tibetans, and keep that

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:39.760
 practice, and share that to the others, and go, and keep the good conductors, keep your samayas,

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:47.360
 keep the the bodhicitta, and to benefit all beings, and everyone who's connected to you,

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:55.840
 welcome to this pure lens, and you're going to benefit, get ready for the whole world,

00:27:55.840 --> 00:28:02.560
 and particularly to the Tibetans. Tibetans, you will be going to benefit, and do that,

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:10.080
 and don't forget, don't forget what I said. He said that, and then I, he's going to come, and

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:18.240
 I feel kind of so happy in the joy, when he said that, that I hold, touch hand, hold his feet,

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:26.800
 and he said, now going back to Tibet is, is so difficult. Even going back to Tibet, even the

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:32.320
 Buddha, Buddha came to Tibet, is not going to really benefit. There's so many kind of like,

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:38.480
 things happening, there's so many emotions are coming, one after another, it's that, and I was

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:46.080
 really tired and bored, and so let me please, master, dear father, let me stay here, here,

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:53.840
 and I'd like to be here. This is good. Back to Tibet is so much. He said, again Gurbel Massama said

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:53.840
,

00:28:53.840 --> 00:29:01.280
 dear son, don't give up your bodhicitta. Do you remember when you allowed Rosa? Rosa, that means

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:08.800
 one of 25 disciples, or the predecessor of Venerable. Remember what you did, bodhicitta aspirations

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:08.800
,

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:15.360
 or bodhicitta aspirations, and that bodhicitta aspiration, you have to propel right now.

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:19.920
 Whoever connected to you, whether it's good connected, whether it's bad connection,

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:29.680
 you're going to help with that. Don't discourage it, increase your bodhicitta, and do benefit for

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:36.640
 all the sentient beings. And you have variety of the tools to benefit all the big, all the beings.

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:44.080
 Don't hold back those, share those teachings as much as you can, and your lineage will be,

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:50.480
 will be uninterrupted, will help. And this your teaching, what you're revealing, that will become

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:57.600
 hot vitality, or hot essence of the teachings, and I will bless you all the time. Don't,

00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:04.320
 don't give up, bless, I mean, don't give up your bodhicitta. So Gurbel Massama said that,

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:12.000
 I feel so kind of sad, and leaving the places, and I cry. Again Gurbel Massama pat me on my head,

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:21.470
 and said, listen son, you've been here 21 days, that is your pure perceptions. And it is your dream

00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:21.680
,

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:29.360
 your dream. And you go back to Tibet without waking up your dreams. Keep your dream yoga

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:35.840
 practice, because you are the power of the dream yoga practice. With that dream yoga, you go back

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:42.400
 to Tibet immediately, and then you will come back to me. You were never going to separate from me.

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:48.080
 So go back to Tibet, sit there. And then Gurbel Massama said, the more our instructions,

00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:54.480
 almost our instructions, that I didn't put all in here. At that time, particularly,

00:30:55.920 --> 00:31:07.680
 and I hold her, the Yichintzoya's Yichintzoya, I cried, cried. And please again, let me stay.

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:15.040
 And she gave a lot of instructions, and they have to go back. So I then, I finally touch their

00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:22.400
 feet, feet. And then they kind of assured me, assured me outside of the palace. And from there,

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:32.720
 then I kind of like, keep my dream, dream, and pass into the north east direction. And they went

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:40.400
 over to so many countries, and the lands, and the rivers. And then finally, I got back to,

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:48.000
 before the, I mean, sun light come. Somehow sun is hitting on the mountain top,

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:54.800
 that I, I went back to my Yichintzoya cabin. When I went back to my Yichintzoya cabin,

00:31:54.800 --> 00:32:02.880
 my wife, or his cousin, known as Chudizamo, he was sitting in a Yichintzoya hut, and he's making

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:12.000
 beautiful ceremony of the long light prayers. And so that is the, my, what's it called,

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:19.040
 the text dreams and the vegans, how he went to Copa glory mountains. And so that is a brief

00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:26.320
 story of the Renanam one. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, so I think we'll stop here. Thank you.

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:32.560
 It's Renanam. But yeah, we conquered this Renanam now. Really, thank you.
