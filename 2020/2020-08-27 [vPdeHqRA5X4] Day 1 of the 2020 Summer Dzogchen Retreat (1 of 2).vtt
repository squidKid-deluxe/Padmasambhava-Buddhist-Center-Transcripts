00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 Thank you very much again, everyone, for participating. I said already, thank you very much again

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.800
 for coming, and be together, and kind of following them, reflecting the teachings.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:48.710
 Now, we are going to again follow the teachings, and when we follow the teachings, that means we

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.280
 will be practicing, meditating,

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:59.280
 listen to the teachings, whatever we are doing regarding the teachings of the Buddha Dhamma is so

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.240
 important, not just so important, but it's crucial.

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:14.460
 It's the basic condition to correct that motivation, or attitude, because motivation is the

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.760
 foundation.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:26.480
 Motivation is the essential. Motivation is keeping up the practice, exactly as what we want.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:36.080
 Therefore, correcting the motivation, or attitude, that means our mind, we have to correct mind.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:46.720
 From what we have to correct, from our old habit patterns, those are so unhealthy, unbeneficial,

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.880
 not just unbeneficial, they're troublemakers.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:02:00.030
 Truly, all the troubles we're going through, experienced, is really fundamental, started from this,

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.440
 our mind.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:09.420
 Now, we have the life of the greatest teacher, Buddha's teaching. Therefore, we have to reverse

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.320
 that.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:17.200
 That motivation is not talking about the motivation of others. We're talking, or I'm talking, our

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.360
self, my motivation and your motivation.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:28.290
 That is what we have to change. So in order to change, we don't have to do any big things, or

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.480
 become different things.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:40.650
 It's just really bringing our normal, tailored motivation that we always see, and think, and tell

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.200
 to others, it's good.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:53.400
 What is that? It's joy, and appreciation. It's simple, it's basic. Joy and appreciation, really

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.320
 bring.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:03.360
 Joy and appreciation of our own life, precious life, and situation, circumstances that we have now,

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.240
 it's all that we have to glorify that.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:11.840
 Not let that fall in the midst of the old, old habit patterns and the troubleless death.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.380
 Then we really can't almost come to sink in the dark, and completely can't go in the wrong

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:18.480
 directions.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:25.120
 That which is samsara, this is samsara. Now we let you reverse, or at least change something to do.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:33.450
 Bring that light in our samsara dilemmas. That light is not just going to come from ourself, we

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.680
 have to start ourself.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:41.520
 With the assistance of the greatest teacher, Vada Chakra Muni, and work them assemble. So therefore

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.560
, for that motivation,

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:51.940
 joy and appreciation, our situation, our circumstances, and all teleposons, opportunities, what we

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:52.640
 have now.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.680
 Particularly, we are connected to the teaching. And in teaching, maybe we think, oh, it's casual

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.600
 and normal, and this and that.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:06.810
 But that is not just really like that. We really think it's not normal, it's not casual. Teaching

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.480
 is so precious.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:18.000
 Teaching is nothing but revering our own beautiful nature. Our own goodness highlights that.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:25.360
 That is loving kindness, the compassion. It's joy and appreciation. And that's what we want. That's

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.960
 what everyone wants.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.680
 So that is so special, to highlight that qualities.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:37.920
 Forget with that, in the second motivation, known as bodhicam, of course, you all know, vastness of

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.840
 motivation.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:46.760
 Of the bodhicam, for all living beings, it's best upon the compassion. Thinking of all living

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.080
 beings, how many living, going through the difficult travels.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:56.000
 That includes us. We all really go through. But what is really the solution?

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.340
 Solution is the compassion. Loving kindness. And we really bring up the compassion and loving

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.920
 kindness in our mind.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:13.150
 That well is, not just is, but it will dispel, it will extend, build a kind of expel out of the

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:14.240
 surface.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:21.520
 And not just expel somewhere in the teaching state, it will transform all the difficult travels

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.600
 into perfect, beautiful, natural states.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:31.920
 So therefore, again, bodhicam. Kindly, compare your thoughts to all living beings.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:38.230
 Today I'm going to practice meditating, reflecting on the teaching. Nothing but to help, to all the

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:39.200
 sentences.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:45.110
 May that remove all the suffering and difficulties, travels to every living being. And joy and

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:49.040
 peace come immediately in their heart and mind.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:56.960
 And we become without enlightenment. We wish that all very beautiful, as much as we can.

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:02.880
 And the next one is known as the motivation of the purity motivation in the teaching state.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.700
 Because today's teaching, what we're doing, and also practice what we're doing, is Vedayana

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:08.560
 teaching.

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:14.540
 And Vedayana teaching often measured everything in purity states. In the divine mandalas,

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.080
 everything is related.

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:22.880
 The mandalas of the Buddha's enlightenment. So we really see that purity status.

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:29.120
 In order to see this, what we see? All these forms are enlightenment. All the sounds are

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.880
 enlightenment songs.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:38.560
 And the mind and space are enlightened states. And in reality, it is all is death.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:46.720
 But why we don't see right now? Because due to our duality mind, and grasping, clinging.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:55.640
 This duality mind is like cataracts. It's completely blocked the pure vision of the way it takes

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:56.320
 out.

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:02.240
 So now, our practice means we are going to remove the cataracts of the dualities.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:10.920
 Therefore, we're going to reveal the nature. All these purity states. Subject is pure, object is

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.920
 pure, and everything is purity states.

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:19.360
 That is known as Vedayana mandalas. Everything is enlightenment.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:24.240
 When we do, for example, visualizations. Why are we doing the visualizations?

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:33.110
 Visualizations get way to discover of that purity. That divine mandalas immediately uses the

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:41.440
 powerful skill of meaning technique to dispel the habit of greatness and discovering the mandala.

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:49.520
 The purity. Thou subject is enlightened, object is enlightened, everything is enlightened states.

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:56.640
 That is part of the method. Immediately we're using that as Buddha taught, known as visualization

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:58.640
 or creation states.

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:04.380
 So that is really this. Therefore, again, even though we're not doing exactly visualizations,

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:08.640
 practice now, but at least open up that thought.

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:14.400
 Everything is beauty states. We distort and then reflect the teachings.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:19.920
 Now, teaching what we're going to talk. I'm going to talk, and you're going to learn, or you're

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:28.760
 going to reactivate your old understanding of your practices by this teaching, by the great Master

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:29.920
 Mohandaj.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:38.300
 This is, and what is it? Discover, promote your wisdom through the Jyotji meditations. That is what

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:45.440
 we're going to do in a little bit. It says, "Rum, Jungtak, Yishi, nimkhosya sambhosya."

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:52.540
 Now, I talk briefly again about the history of the teachings. Generally, where the teaching comes

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:53.040
 from,

00:08:53.040 --> 00:09:11.120
 it always goes back to the Buddha, Buddha Shakyamuni, who came 600 years ago. A great teacher,

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:14.640
 Buddha Shakyamuni came, came in his womb.

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:24.160
 8/24, he reached enlightenment, becoming enlightened. Seven weeks after the Buddha's enlightenment,

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.080
 he gave the first teachings,

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:32.690
 which according to the very calendar of a system that happened yesterday, turning the wheel of dh

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:33.200
arma.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:40.450
 First teachings that Buddha Shakyamuni gives. These first teachings, the teachings are known as,

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:44.320
 known as, the poor noble truth teachings.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:53.530
 Poor noble truth teaching is nothing but teachings on the cause and effect, teachings on the cause

00:09:53.530 --> 00:10:00.560
 and effort, cause and effort of samsara, cause and effort of nirvana.

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:11.380
 But also, there is nothing that is happening without cause and conditions. There is nothing that

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:12.640
 will happen.

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:21.520
 Everything is caused and conditioned through that combination, developing the result.

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:31.130
 That logic goes the same way to the samsara, same way to the nirvana. And so samsara is nothing

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:38.560
 happening by itself. It has cause. It has conditions.

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:49.970
 Cause is supported by the conditions and developing the samsara. Nirvana has cause and nirvana has

00:10:49.970 --> 00:11:00.830
 conditions, by the combination of cause and condition and actualizing of the development of nirvan

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:01.440
as.

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:10.490
 This combination system is known as in Buddhism, interdependent coordination. It is all interming

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:18.080
led, all connected, all cooperated, that means what cooperation?

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:25.920
 Cause is cooperating with the conditions. Conditions are cooperating with the cause.

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:36.130
 Mingling that very perfectly, beautifully and developing. This is not just only one cause and one

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:46.800
 condition. It has also many factors. Each of those is also connected and cooperated.

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:56.780
 Cooperated is known as interdependent, as you all know, you heard. Until nirvana. All in nirvana,

00:11:56.780 --> 00:12:03.040
 in nirvana, in nirvana, is connected, is nirvana. And through that.

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:12.030
 That teaching is, post-teaching is known as then, poor, noble, true teaching. So poor, noble, true

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:19.750
 teaching is teaching on the cause and condition of the, cause and effect of the samsara, cause and

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:22.000
 effect of the nirvanas.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:32.990
 Positive truth, which is suffering true and cause of suffering true. That is samsara. So samsara is

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:36.640
 suffering true and cause of suffering true.

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:47.870
 And nirvana is, seseyu true and the poor truth. These two are. What great teacher, Buddha Chakra

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:55.760
 Muni said, you must recognize the suffering truth. Recognize it.

00:12:55.760 --> 00:13:10.170
 And then he said, you must do a bending the cause of suffering truth. This is a very profound topic

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:16.960
, topic. First, we have to know the suffering. Of course, we all know samsara.

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:26.310
 Generally, there is two different sufferings. Gross suffering and a sudden sufferings. Gross

00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:35.520
 suffering, everyone knows. Everyone, even the animals, they know us. We all know.

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:41.540
 What we like to do? We like to remove. We don't like to have that. It's painful. It's suffering. It

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:46.640
's dead, difficult, it's trouble. I don't want that. We like to remove.

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:56.010
 What we are doing is samsara. What do we think? We look at temporary solutions. This is not what we

00:13:56.010 --> 00:13:59.120
 are thinking of. I'm going to do temporary things.

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:07.100
 But that is the habit better. You only think, "Oh, yes, I like to remove this." Because then, when

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:12.720
 you remove, it's gone. That's true for time being. It's subsided.

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:23.220
 But the fundamental suffering, the sudden suffering, that we don't know. What is that? That is ego-

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:24.800
claimings.

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:35.060
 All these attachments, emotions, that is really sudden sufferings. But same time, that way, this

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:44.880
 old suffering is gross and the sudden is coming because it's negative emotions and not knowing.

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:51.960
 That is, even if we have temporary solutions to remove the suffering, pain, it's difficult, but of

00:14:51.960 --> 00:15:00.240
 course it's there, convey it to the there. It comes. Then suffering is endless. It will come back,

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.960
 even though in that case, it's samsara to you.

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:11.040
 If something is solution, then it changes back. You can experience it. Then gross suffering comes.

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:17.960
 So that's how we think this samsara is. It's called and then for that reason, what would I say?

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:23.840
 When you should know the suffering truth, know the suffering truth, that should also know where it

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:24.960
's coming from.

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:32.560
 You should break the knowledge where the suffering is a difficult trouble or challenge is coming,

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:35.960
 because it's a cause of suffering truth.

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:43.440
 So if we don't want to relieve the suffering, difficult troubles, we have to go to the root. Root

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:45.960
 is negative emotions.

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:51.570
 Negative emotions, such as ignorance, attachment, anger. Ignorance is also kind of settled. We don

00:15:51.570 --> 00:16:00.840
't know that. The gross one is little more gross. Emotions are attachment, anger, jealous, head and

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:01.960
 thought.

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:10.720
 Those are gross causes of suffering. It's caused and is kind of pushed by the ignorance. We have to

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:11.960
 remove them.

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:22.320
 That, but in the teaching, says, "Pree from the old, kept up, read out the cause of suffering truth

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:22.960
."

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:29.760
 Now, in order to read out the suffering truth, what is? What is that known as? When you read out

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:34.960
 the suffering, cause of suffering truth, the suffering truth, when you do that, what is that?

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:42.110
 It's called the cessation truth. Cessation is free from the sufferings, free from the cause of

00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:46.960
 sufferings, not just the suffering, cause of sufferings.

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:55.690
 All cause of sufferings are, as I said, negative emotions. Ignorance, attachment, anger, jealous,

00:16:55.690 --> 00:17:01.960
 head and thoughts. All those, those are the cause of suffering truth.

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:08.960
 And that will be, that when you spread all that, what is done? Cessation truth.

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:15.960
 In order to do cessation truth, what do we have to do? Cessation is a result, result.

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:23.140
 Now the cause and the condition to purify or to remove, take off the suffering truth or difficulty

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:32.960
 check and troubles. That is part truth. Part. That is part truth.

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:43.200
 Part truth. Then, there is so many great teachers, Buddha Shaktamiri give. Part truth. Part truth

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:52.900
 including the Theravada teaching, Mahayana teaching, Shukramahayana teaching, and Vaidyana

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:53.960
 teachings.

00:17:53.960 --> 00:18:02.760
 All those teachings are known as part truth. Everything. It will lead to the real goal of the

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:08.960
 accordingly teachings, whatever you follow them. That is part truth.

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:16.040
 Now, teachings on this part truth, Buddha give, then Vaidyana teachings, those known as three Prit

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:25.960
aka teachings, three Bhaskar teachings, Vinaya teachings, Abhidhamma teachings, and Sutra teachings.

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:34.060
 Those are three principle teachings that will encompass the entire Buddha teaching. That includes,

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:36.960
 also is included Vaidyana teaching too.

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:45.090
 Vinaya teaching, Sutra teaching, and Abhidhamma teachings. Those are the teachings. The meaning of

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:47.960
 that, what we are going to practice.

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:55.880
 Meaning of the teachings of all the three Bhaskar teachings is, the principle meaning of the Vinaya

00:18:55.880 --> 00:19:00.960
 teachings is teachings on the conduct, teachings on the morality.

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:09.960
 That means despairing, reducing, and redirecting our whole habit of the negative immuteness.

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:17.960
 So, therefore we do the morality practices. It is the best on the conduct.

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:24.960
 And then, the Sutra teaching, the principle teaching of the Sutra is teachings on the concentrates.

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:30.960
 That is more dealing with mind, more dealing with mind, concentrates.

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:37.840
 And very more, meditating on the love and kindness, meditating on the compadres, meditating on the

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:44.960
 jokchins, meditating on the Mahamadras, meditating on the Vinayas, or meditating on the Madimamas.

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:52.680
 All those teachings are known as concentrated meditations. And which is also the worst practice too

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:52.960
.

00:19:52.960 --> 00:20:00.960
 And the Muslim practice, the Muslim essence of the Abhidhamma is Muslim, known as the Vastava.

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:05.960
 But what is that? It is understanding as it is.

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:13.960
 Exiling as it means, related to truth, exiling as it is, absolute truth, exiling as it is.

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:23.490
 So, that is what the really Muslim teaching is. Muslim teaching is, kind of like seeing everything,

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:28.570
 exiling the path truth, exiling as it is, and to avoiding or to kind of obstacles of the path truth

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:28.960
.

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:38.960
 Also, seeing clearly, it is like eyes of the old practices. So, that is the morality practices.

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:47.960
 Now, without understanding, and particularly this teaching, is known as the Dzogchi teachings.

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:51.960
 And it is path truth teachings, Dzogchi teachings.

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:56.960
 Dzogchi teachings is again, a real thing of this Dzogchi teachings.

00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:03.980
 But again, as I said, all these three Dzogchi teachings, but also at the same time, the path truth

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:04.960
 is can be.

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:12.960
 Also, Dzogchi, 9 different level of teachings, 9 different level of teachings, is all path truths.

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:21.900
 And that means, Dzogchi, a variety of joys for the practitioners, how to explore the meaning and

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:25.960
 the nature of the goals, or resolve the goals.

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:29.960
 But again, variety of teachings, one upon others.

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:36.060
 Eight teachings are, for example, post-teaching. When Buddha gives the post-teaching, post-teaching

00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:37.960
 is like Shravaka teaching.

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:41.960
 Shravaka teaching, then second teaching of the particular Buddha teaching.

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:46.960
 Which is not, if I say, the post-level, second level, 9 different levels.

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:54.550
 If I say, the second teaching is more determined, more clear, more liberated than the post-teaching

00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:54.960
.

00:21:54.960 --> 00:22:01.960
 And third teaching is more elaborated post-teaching, more clear, more profound.

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:08.960
 Poor teaching is like this. Poor, picked teaching is more clear, more elaborated, more clarityless.

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:12.960
 It's getting closer and closer to the natures.

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:20.960
 What did the teaching say? Clarity and expanding and completed.

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:28.960
 So, if you go high and high, it's more clear of the teachings of the natures.

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:33.960
 It's more clear, more precise, more detailed and more completed.

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:40.280
 What means complete? Completed to accommodate the merit, or the techniques are completed, more

00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:41.960
 accommodated than merit,

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:47.960
 and the techniques are more completed to put aside the negative video or response.

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:58.600
 So, in the debate, what the teachings say? Sar, ji, zop. Sar means more clarity, and ji means more

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:00.960
 detailed,

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:05.960
 and zop means more complemented. One hour.

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:12.960
 So, in that way, come to the peak of the teaching, which is ninth teaching.

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:19.900
 Ninth jnana teaching, the peak of the ninth jnana is known as Adiyoga teachings, or the Jockey

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:20.960
 teachings.

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:31.130
 Adiyoga is the peak of the teaching. Peak of the clarityless, peak of the detailedness, peak of the

00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:32.960
 completions.

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:40.960
 There's nothing more to explain than the Jockey teachings, or Adiyoga teachings.

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:49.990
 There's nothing more clarity of the nature, about the nature of everything than the Jockey

00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:50.960
 teachings.

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:55.960
 There's nothing more detailed than the Jockey teachings.

00:23:55.960 --> 00:24:03.960
 What is the teaching saying? Even one person, the Buddha, comes, progresses right now with us.

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:13.960
 There's nothing more clear, more explained, more detailed than these Jockey teachings.

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:19.960
 That is really the peak of the Jockey teachings. Jockey is the peak of the teachings.

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:28.960
 That means it's ultimate nature. There's nothing in order to go, to explore the nature,

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:37.860
 and there's nothing more, more polar, self-scary technique than the Jockey to discover in the

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:38.960
 nature,

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:44.960
 or the enlightenment, or Buddha-hood. So that is what the really Jockey is.

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:47.960
 That is the one we really connect with.

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:58.210
 So right now, when there's a Jockey teaching, the greatest teacher, the Buddha, did not give these

00:24:58.210 --> 00:24:59.960
 Jockey teachings,

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:11.960
 or even the Vedayana teachings, openly in India, when the Buddha came,

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:17.960
 two thousand, six hundred years ago, he did not give, openly.

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:26.790
 Then, when he gave, according to the teachings, he gave these all the Vedayana teachings in the

00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:28.960
 higher state,

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:35.960
 higher realm, at the same time when he gave the teaching of the poor novelty of the teachings.

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:40.960
 At the same time when he gave the second turning well of the downloads.

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:46.960
 At the same time when he gave the card turning well of the downloads, all the other times,

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:51.960
 it's not limited, restricted by the time in space.

00:25:51.960 --> 00:26:07.430
 Where even the readiness, the audience, who are capable to observe, to receive, to adjust the

00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:08.960
 teaching,

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:14.960
 that teaching is its own and a rewarding thing.

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:23.600
 So Buddha gave these higher realms, and this higher realm is known as Vaak, the Akanishta in

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:24.960
 Sanskrit.

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:31.960
 In a debate, it translated "Omen", and that ever translated into English.

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:43.460
 The realm of the within, not the duality. A realm of the beyond duality. Land of the beyond duality

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:43.960
.

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:50.960
 That's the one where Buddha gave these teachings.

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:57.960
 So for that reason, in the teaching saying, according to his story, when Buddha is entering Mahab

00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:02.960
harata in the Rangas, in 881 in the Kushina,

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:11.960
 that time many Sangha members are gathered. All highly-realizing great beings, the Bodhisattvas,

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:19.960
 and many many Shabakas, and Ahavas, many of those enlightened beings, really gathered around Buddha

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:19.960
.

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:23.960
 Buddha announced he was going to enter Mahabharata in the Rangas.

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:29.220
 In the teaching, in the Mahayana teaching, his story says, among the gurus, the many Shri, the

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:30.960
 western Bodhisattva,

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:39.670
 or many Shri, the great was involving all the Bodhisattvas of the westerns, many Shri was there too

00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:39.960
.

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:48.960
 Many Shri asked Buddha, all great teachers, "You give the teachings, all the causal teachings,

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:56.960
 causal teachings, but you did not give the result teachings."

00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:00.960
 When that will happen, that's it.

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:06.960
 And now these are two terminologies. I use causal and results.

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:11.960
 I'm sure many of you already know what that means.

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:18.960
 But few of you don't know what it means, causal and result.

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:29.960
 Causal means working with cause, with conditions, getting in line, or result, in line, is result.

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:38.160
 So more purpose, more purpose, more emphasize gathering the conditions with cause and trying to

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:39.960
 develop the result.

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:43.960
 That is known as causal.

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:52.960
 And that means what? This, all the subtle teachings, you work with cause for the enlightenment.

00:28:52.960 --> 00:29:01.960
 Cause, you already had the cause, but you work with conditions, cause and condition connected.

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:08.960
 One is a condition, of course, in the teachings said here too, great Master Mohanamud said here too

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:08.960
,

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:14.630
 that's, have to tell those things, have to explain and have to remind that things to all

00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:15.960
 practitioners.

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:19.960
 One is a condition of to get enlightenment.

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:25.960
 It's true merits, true merits are conditions.

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:30.960
 Here, great Master Mohanamud said, said here, at the end of this booklet,

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:39.960
 said here, said, the path is true merits, that must be true merits.

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:44.960
 Here, what in the teaching said, do not ignore the merit of the accumulations.

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:52.960
 The ground is the true truth, the path is true merit, the result is the union of the two guides.

00:29:52.960 --> 00:30:02.960
 It is important to have these additional words or the additional teacher or have to talk during

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:03.960
 these teachings,

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:06.960
 that teaching, but we are going to go through this.

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:14.180
 So in a way, it says that, so therefore, again, this is the condition of to get enlightenment, it's

00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:14.960
 true merits.

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:22.390
 So you're working with to merit and with cause and like to get enlightenment, and getting

00:30:22.390 --> 00:30:24.960
 enlightenment, it will get enlightenment.

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:31.960
 That is known as, working with cause of the enlightenment is called causal yanas.

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:41.830
 All these Mahayana teachings, Kerevada teachings, are considered as causal yanas, particularly Mah

00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:42.960
ayanas.

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:54.120
 Result yana means, you're working with result now, immediately result, the fruit, result, like to

00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:54.960
 get.

00:30:54.960 --> 00:31:02.960
 You're not really working with cause or you're immediately working with result.

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:10.960
 What that means, because Mahayana teaching has so many matters.

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:21.510
 You know, Mahayana teaching said, Mahayana has poor spell qualities or poor external needs, which

00:31:21.510 --> 00:31:21.960
 is,

00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:35.180
 Mahayana teaching is not blurred, view of the Mahayana teaching is not blurred or not vague, it's

00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:39.960
 so brilliant, so clear, so clarityless.

00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:47.960
 And the Mahayana teaching is not, kind of, limited, skillful means.

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:57.160
 Mahayana teaching has so many skillful means to apply, to remove, instantly, the negativities and

00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:58.960
 obscurations and habit dependence,

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:10.960
 in the world, in like magic natures, and then Mahayana teaching, therefore, it's not hardships.

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:17.960
 If you know the right way to apply, it's not difficult at all, not hardships.

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:27.960
 It's easy, easy life, easy comfortable, if you have the right skills.

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:36.960
 Why? Because all the Mahayana practitioners have highly culpability, highly alerted individuals.

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:39.960
 That's what in the teaching said.

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:59.960
 What in this is not known as Susan Gromis, in that teaching said.

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:14.960
 I said already, but this quotation, I like to grade it, it's not coming in my mind.

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:34.960
 But the meaning I said is tawa mamupas, tawa mamupas, tawa mamupas.

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:42.910
 Okay, so the meaning, what I said is really is to, the meaning, the will is so clear, will is

00:33:42.910 --> 00:33:44.960
 perfect, perfect.

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:55.290
 Will is perfect, and method is so many methods, meditation, and activity, conduct is so simple,

00:33:55.290 --> 00:33:59.960
 easy, and therefore, it is high culpability.

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:06.960
 Anyway, so that is what the Mahayana teaching is.

00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:13.360
 So, among the Mahayana teaching, among the Mahayana teaching, zouki is the peak of that, of all the

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:15.960
 teachings, is high as the teachings.

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:19.960
 There's nothing higher to go than these teachings.

00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:28.430
 So that is, so that teaching, how this teaching came, now, as the great Maha Buddha said, said,

00:34:28.430 --> 00:34:29.960
 when you feel it's said,

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:37.420
 or you did not give the cause, only you give the cause of teaching, did not expound the result's

00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:41.960
 teachings, and Buddha said.

00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:49.910
 And I said, those who are Buddha said, said, I give the teaching, those who are so keen and

00:34:49.910 --> 00:34:55.960
 interested of the cause and the condition teaching, I give that teaching so clearly.

00:34:55.960 --> 00:35:03.210
 But those who are highly, in high culpability and interested, and like to have that, that

00:35:03.210 --> 00:35:05.960
 immediately approaching enlightenment teaching,

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:13.360
 that teaching what I give already, in higher realm, and soon after Maha Maha Pari Narayana, that

00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:18.960
 those teachings will appear, as time is reading.

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:28.130
 As Buddha said, according to teaching, 27 years after the Buddha kept coming is Maha Pari Narayana,

00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:33.960
 and all the very other teachings are beginning to appear in one after another.

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:42.560
 What means, all very other teachings, Kriya Tantal teachings, Opa Tantal teachings, and Yova Tantal

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:47.960
 teachings, and Maha Yova teachings, Anu Yova teachings,

00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:53.960
 and Ahti Yova teachings, or the Doki teachings, all those are coming one after another.

00:35:53.960 --> 00:36:02.120
 It has very beautiful, long histories, how those teachings appear, one after another is dead, and

00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:04.960
 of course, you can find that more in the books and all that.

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:11.320
 I'm not going to trouble those things now. But particularly, among that, in the Doki teachings, how

00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:13.960
 these Doki teachings came.

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:15.210
 As Buddha already gave, in the higher realm, and the teachings said, all these Doki teachings are

00:36:15.210 --> 00:36:22.960
 in the Doki teachings,

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:30.420
 and these courses received so many, those highly, highly comparable practitioners, but it is

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:36.960
 preserved and gathered by the Vedya Panis.

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:45.960
 Vedya Panis, all the Sana Dorjus, Vedya Panis, and as well as the Vedya Sadas.

00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:54.960
 And so, these teachings then, appeared again around 27 years of the Buddhism Maha Pari Narayana.

00:36:54.960 --> 00:37:02.960
 There is, in the Urjana, west of India, there is remarkable, individually, emanation was born,

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:05.960
 miracle is born, known as Garab Dorjus,

00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:14.100
 or Asya Vethika in Sanskrit, it was born. The moment he was born, born, he was remarkable in life,

00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:16.960
 and he is completely awake in the way of death.

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:28.230
 And then, soon after, he was able to receive entirely teachings of the Doki from Vedya Panis and as

00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:30.960
 well as Vedya Sadas.

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:35.960
 He received entirely teachings. Entire Doki teachings made work.

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:37.960
 According to the teaching, there is in the teaching said, in the Doki

00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:59.780
 Dantara, over 60, hundred total Doki Dantas, that is transmitted to Garab Dorjus, from Vedya Panis

00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:01.960
 or Vedya Sadas.

00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:11.960
 So now, Garab Dorjus becomes the sole Doki lineage holders of this earth, earth.

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:19.820
 And Garab Dorjus, he shared these teachings. Then, according to the teaching, it is a single

00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:20.960
 lineage most of the time,

00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:28.880
 but three of the first students he shared, but among them, foremost students, it is mandatory

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:29.960
 matters.

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:40.950
 So, Garab Dorjus, how in the teaching said this? Garab Dorjus gave all those teachings to Manjich

00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:42.960
iri Madras.

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:49.000
 In Manjichiri Madras, when he received the teachings, he became the holder of now entire Doki

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:49.960
 teachings

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:57.960
 and Manjichiri Madras led to group Doki teachings in three sections.

00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:07.960
 Those are known as mind sections, and space sections, and pit instruction sections.

00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:15.960
 And also in the teaching said, outer sections of the mind, Doki teaching,

00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:23.960
 and inner sections of the space, Doki teaching, known as lungdeo, or the space section.

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:33.030
 And the essence, the secret sections of the Doki teaching is known as pit instruction sections, D

00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:33.960
oki teachings.

00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:38.960
 So those are three groups.

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:45.150
 And Manjichiri Madras also, many, many students, he was a very great scholar, very great master of

00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:45.960
 scholars.

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:53.730
 He is a many student, but Doki teaching, according to the teaching, that he only handed, shared to

00:39:53.730 --> 00:39:55.960
 the great master, Sirisa.

00:39:55.960 --> 00:40:03.960
 Sirisa. So, Sirisa has become the principal leading holders of the Doki teachings.

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:11.960
 Now, Sirisa, again, the third section, the secret section of the Doki teaching,

00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:22.620
 Sirisa, again, clarified, organized in a way that in four different sections, outer, inner, and

00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:23.960
 secret,

00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:33.960
 and very, very secret sections, four sections, that Sirisa clarified and created.

00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:42.310
 And that teaching, those old teachings, came then to the Hiri Sangha, the three students, these

00:40:42.310 --> 00:40:42.960
 teachings,

00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:49.960
 to the Merope Masambha, to Yana Sukhara, and Vumal Matas, three great masters.

00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:57.160
 All become, every one of those great masters, become transcendental what's the land body who

00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:59.960
 achieved, transcendental what's the land body.

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:09.960
 So, those are the three students. Among those three students, this Doki teaching is bored to Tibet

00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:11.960
 by great masters,

00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:22.960
 Gurup M Masambha and Vumal Matara. So, Vumal Matara and great master, Gurup M Masambha,

00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:31.060
 bore the teachings of the pit instructions, teachings of those Hiri Sangha's teachings, teaching to

00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:31.960
 Tibet.

00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:39.960
 Which is essence of the teachings. Then, in a minute, the very Buddhism came out, developing, in

00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:39.960
 eight centuries,

00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:46.960
 and around, maybe, eight centuries, twelve, like mid-eight centuries, centuries,

00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:53.960
 and then Merope Masambha, what I call it as a historic, and if I say roughly, that Merope Masambha,

00:41:53.960 --> 00:42:03.960
 Merope Masambha and Gurup M Masambha came, seven in the sixties, eighty, to Tibet, and establish

00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:03.960
 that,

00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:09.960
 and help to build the post-Buddhist monasteries in Tibet.

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:17.090
 And after monasteries are completed, so many students are gathered, because the king, the desire of

00:42:17.090 --> 00:42:21.960
 the King Joseph of Italy is really to bring the entire Buddha down in Tibet.

00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:28.120
 The entire teaching, the scriptural and the realisation practice, the lineage that he really likes

00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:28.960
 to bring.

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:31.960
 So now, the temple is complete, but the lights are not enough.

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:38.960
 You have to now re-alternate, train the debate from that soil, that country.

00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:42.960
 So then, as I said, with Merope Masambha, Gurup M Masambha, Gurup M Masambha,

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:51.960
 he gathered many students of young, brilliant, remarkable emanational disciples, or the young ones,

00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:58.310
 gathered, and among that, one of the brilliant emanation, reincarnation, or the emanations of the

00:42:58.310 --> 00:43:01.960
 Buddhas, or the creative beings, is Veroja.

00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:09.010
 And Veroja now, when he was growing up, and he started speaking the Sanskrit language, the Indian

00:43:09.010 --> 00:43:13.960
 language, and then he encouraged him to go to India.

00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:17.960
 He was courageous for it, and courageous determinations.

00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:27.800
 He had performed his mission of life, and we went to India, and met Magyutri mothers in the western

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:28.960
 borders, in the particular hirizam.

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:30.960
 He met the hirizams.

00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:37.960
 And he stayed a long time with the hirizam, and the entire teachings, the teachings of the Zokri.

00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:45.290
 Particularly from the hirizam, he received the teachings of the outer sections of the Zokri, and

00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:46.960
 the inner section of the Zokri,

00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:51.960
 which made, in the Tibetan world, simply in the long day teachings.

00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:59.100
 Both are received. I translate it simply as mind section, and the long day as spirit section, he

00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:00.960
 received all the teachings.

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:06.780
 Then, in the teaching said, in the western border of Garabdoji and the Magyutri middle, he received

00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:08.960
 all the other teachings too.

00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:16.070
 But, when he came back, he returned back to Tibet, and then he shared particularly the Zokri

00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:23.960
 teachings of the spirit section and mind sections of the Zokri teachings to the Tibetans.

00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:32.440
 So, this is 70 and the long days are really bought and told by, bought by the great Master Shandhar

00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:35.960
athata, the great Master Verojana, and the tax letter too.

00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:44.210
 And he shared and gave this to the Tibetan practitioners by the great Master and tax letter Veroj

00:44:44.210 --> 00:44:44.960
ana.

00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:47.960
 So, that's all the Zokri teachings are complete.

00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:56.210
 That means, 70 is completed in Tibet, lonely is completed in Tibet, and the Menadhi is completed in

00:44:56.210 --> 00:44:56.960
 Tibet.

00:44:56.960 --> 00:45:06.960
 That particular Menadhi is then highlighted and shared by the women, Madra and Marpana Suma.

00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:10.960
 So, that is the historian of the teachings.

00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:16.960
 And all those great Masters who received the Zokri teachings,

00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:23.960
 they all reached the tax letter of Master Verojana within their single life-time.

00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:32.160
 Not just only that, so many of those are ledundi, and the 70 practitioners really reached the tax

00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:35.960
 letter of Master Verojana, one after another.

00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:44.810
 So, among that, today's what we are talking about is the Mehmagdi, the pit structures, surface of

00:45:44.810 --> 00:45:45.960
 the teachings.

00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:49.960
 Mehmagdi has pit structures.

00:45:49.960 --> 00:46:00.960
 And that is, then, what, again, great Master Verojana, divided or clarified by the group,

00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:05.960
 two sections or three sections.

00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:13.960
 And two sections, which is known as the Gada Tachu and the Nandam Togaras.

00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:20.960
 Currently, the techniques of the Vero from the beginning, known as the Gada Tachu teachings,

00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:32.960
 sort of Togaras, spontaneously inherited, often leaping over techniques opposite of Togaras.

00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:42.960
 And then, how to ascend it, the moment of death, it will elicit it, ram the bodies.

00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:49.960
 Those techniques are the pit and surface of the teachings.

00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:59.960
 That is great is two Masters, Mumal Madhara and Gurba Masumbha, highlighted.

00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:07.950
 Mumal Madhara teachings, Gurba Masumbha teachings, mainly that highlights the teachings from the

00:47:07.950 --> 00:47:08.960
 Thermas.

00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:13.960
 Therma, hidden and rediscovered Therma lineages.

00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:18.960
 And, Mumal Madhara teachings is both.

00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:21.960
 Of course, also Gurba Masumbha is both too.

00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:25.960
 But that is how it is. Both mean the Gama and Therma.

00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:29.960
 Fourth lineages, that's very continuous.

00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:38.960
 And among that two methods of Tachu is highly, highly kind of like well-renowned and well-metered,

00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:42.960
 Gada Tachu and the Nandam Togaras.

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:48.960
 Among that two Tachu teachings, and today's, what we are going through, this old Mumal Madhara

00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:49.960
 teaching,

00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:53.960
 is on the Gada Tachu teachings.

00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:57.960
 Gada, Babur, Pranbighi.

00:47:57.960 --> 00:48:01.960
 Cutting Thoros, and that is what I am translating.

00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:05.960
 Cutting Thoros, what is cutting Thoros?

00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:14.960
 Now, all the happy Tibetans, that all the happy Tibetans,

00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:24.960
 deposits accumulated from the big list times, this technique, of the Duking technique,

00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:33.960
 is cutting that instant, without any trash, without any trace.

00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:36.960
 It's cutting that instant.

00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:46.960
 That powerful technique, and when you practice that powerful teachings with good foundations,

00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:56.960
 good foundations, rich enlightenment, is not measured by the eons or many lifetimes.

00:48:56.960 --> 00:49:05.960
 They are called the teachings. If you practice, anyone who practices, with foundations,

00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:12.960
 with tall instructions, with that, with heart, it's good enlightenment.

00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:20.960
 Of the enlightenment is only measured by the eons or even months in the teaching stage.

00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:24.960
 So that is what this great teaching is.

00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:27.960
 Today, we are going to talk about this.

00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:34.960
 Again, in a way, I am going to talk, as I said, you all read the books,

00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:41.960
 many of those Duking teaching books, and they read the teachings from many great masters.

00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:48.960
 And this year, it has, in a way, become one of the strange times in our times,

00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:54.960
 or maybe in many stories. The whole world is almost kind of locked.

00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:59.960
 Therefore, there is not many of those great masters are able to visit,

00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:04.960
 as often we have opportunities. So they are all kind of like this.

00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:09.960
 This really situation is completely, kind of like, kind of stuck with it,

00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:13.960
 all kind of completely changed for that reason.

00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:19.960
 And with my old Simba members, Dharma friends, assistants, with technologies,

00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:24.960
 I thought, we all thought, maybe somebody can help to activate it,

00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:28.960
 that will support to all your knowledge, all your understanding,

00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:32.960
 your practices by this, this what we are doing together, in a way.

00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:40.960
 So that means, I am, in a way, reminding, reminding, refreshing some degree

00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:46.960
 that can be benefitted to understand of your meditation and your Duking teaching,

00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:50.960
 and your support, so that we can move forward.

00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:54.960
 That's it. And also some degree doesn't end in this situation.

00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:58.960
 And the moral essence of Duking teaching is that it was still in a competitive status,

00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:01.960
 and some benefitted to all the other beings too.

00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:06.960
 This is, because our practice is really, is again, in Mahayana practice,

00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:10.960
 totally best upon body jettas.

00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:13.960
 Whether you are talking about the body jetta of the relative levels,

00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:18.960
 or absolute true level, Duking is absolutely best on the body jetta.

00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:24.960
 So therefore, when you practice that, also really, we are in a relative body jetta level,

00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:29.960
 we really extending and dedicating this merit for all living beings,

00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:34.960
 and to remove their suffering, difficulty is, and free from suffering and difficult trouble.

00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:39.960
 That's why we're joined. We also really, we mean, it's not just saying on the brain,

00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:44.960
 the kind of, as the mambar, with the kind of, as a robot, robot.

00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:48.960
 It's truly, we mean that. That, as the enemy of all, that.

00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:52.960
 So if we do that, that is really practice. That is not practice,

00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:55.960
 but that is also known, accumulation of merits.

00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:59.960
 Accumulation of merit, accumulation of merit.

00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:02.960
 And then Mr. Merit is the Duking meditation.

00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:07.960
 So therefore, this conference. So that's where we talk to go.

00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:13.960
 And now, with this, with this, and then now,

00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:18.960
 but I go over this now, titles, with this, this title here.

00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:22.960
 Here, as you all know that, I mean, you have title.

00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:28.960
 This title is, of course, here, and here.

00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:36.960
 It's called in this page, and as I said earlier, you all know this, you all have this.

00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:43.960
 Discovering the primordial wisdom through Duking meditation

00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:51.960
 and the importance of the stabilizing ripper for the practitioners.

00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:54.960
 So that's really, and very good for us.

00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:59.960
 We all received a lot of teachings, but now we have to stabilize this.

00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:02.960
 And also, we have to maintain this.

00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:05.960
 So this quote, that is what it is.

00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:11.960
 And now, if I go according to this title, and I'm into it, what is it?

00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:15.960
 If those individual who knows to read it, you can also read this.

00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:29.960
 Rengo Chung Tham. Rengo Chung Tham is method how to maintain the will of,

00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:35.960
 you know, of the raka or the awareness, how to move,

00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:39.960
 how to maintain the will of the raka.

00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:43.960
 When you maintain that will of the raka,

00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:47.960
 that is the essence, that moment.

00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:57.960
 We are with the essence of the wisdom, essence of the primordial wisdom.

00:53:57.960 --> 00:53:59.960
 When you maintain that.

00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:01.960
 So that is what it really means.

00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:08.960
 Now, I'm going to talk a little bit about this right in the page,

00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:15.960
 and how the primordial wisdom of this raka, also we have read about raka.

00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:21.960
 Raka, and of course, you all know, you heard, I mean, we all heard raka.

00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:25.960
 According to raka, raka has quite two different meanings,

00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:28.960
 or at least two different meanings.

00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:32.960
 Meanings, according to sattara level, meaning,

00:54:32.960 --> 00:54:37.960
 and according to zoti level meanings.

00:54:37.960 --> 00:54:44.960
 Even though it's the same spelling in Tibet, same grammar, same spelling,

00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:56.960
 but it changed quite big between context we're using this word.

00:54:56.960 --> 00:55:03.960
 Whether it's in sattara, or whether it's in zoti teachings.

00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:11.960
 In sattara teaching, raka is means mind, conception.

00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:20.960
 Raka, lord, raka, siva, those are in the very word, lord means mind.

00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:24.960
 And siva means knowledge.

00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:28.960
 Raka means again, talk, talk.

00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:33.960
 So it's all passing, talking about mind.

00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:36.960
 It's about mind.

00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:38.960
 Mind.

00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:45.960
 And dukki, when you talk about raka, it's not conception.

00:55:45.960 --> 00:55:47.960
 It's not talk.

00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:51.960
 It's not just merely knowledge.

00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:53.960
 What is that?

00:55:53.960 --> 00:56:02.960
 According to dukki teaching, this raka means it is primordial resistance.

00:56:02.960 --> 00:56:06.960
 It is pristine awareness.

00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:10.960
 It is cognizance.

00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:16.960
 It is the mind that, as I suppose you all used,

00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:21.960
 mind that which is free from dualities,

00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:27.960
 that pristine, the cognition, awareness.

00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:36.960
 Awareness free from the dualities, subject and object.

00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:39.960
 That is really the awareness.

00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:41.960
 That is raka.

00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:47.960
 So in dukki teaching, raka, it is said only in the sotrayana Mahayana teaching,

00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:50.960
 it is tathana dha garbha.

00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:52.960
 Buddha nature.

00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:55.960
 It is Buddha nature.

00:56:55.960 --> 00:56:59.960
 It is tathana dha garbha.

00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:01.960
 Tathana dha garbha or the Buddha nature.

00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:06.960
 Buddha sees what is in the teachings, what the great master.

00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:10.960
 Jimungenpa said, essence of the Mahayana sotrayana teaching

00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:15.960
 is the Buddha nature or the Buddha, essence of Buddha,

00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:19.960
 which is free from the three character states.

00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:21.960
 Three character states.

00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:25.960
 Or is the character's nature of the three,

00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:27.960
 number type of ghost of the intimate?

00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:32.960
 Free from the three character states, I have translate it roughly.

00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:38.960
 Means free from the character states, free from the identity,

00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:41.960
 and nature is emptiness.

00:57:41.960 --> 00:57:46.960
 That comment, which is essence of the nature of tathana dha garbha,

00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:53.960
 but that is known as in dukki teaching, is known as raka.

00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:56.960
 Or that is dukki.

00:57:56.960 --> 00:57:58.960
 That is dukki.

00:57:58.960 --> 00:58:08.960
 So raka is dukki or raka is tathana dha garbha, the pure nature.

00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:11.960
 It is ordinary nature.

00:58:11.960 --> 00:58:16.960
 This dathana dha nature or dathana dha garbha, ordinary nature,

00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:18.960
 I'm not talking somebody else.

00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:19.960
 We're talking here.

00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:24.960
 Buddha is pointing out us, right to each of us,

00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:31.960
 our nature, your own nature of the mind.

00:58:31.960 --> 00:58:46.960
 Right now it is the saint, woman, and what's called pristine at the cognitions,

00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:49.960
 free from the dualities.

00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:52.960
 That is raka.

00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:56.960
 That realization, when you have that, that is what the great master,

00:58:56.960 --> 00:59:00.960
 Thad Kannamma also said in teaching, said.

00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:04.960
 This has so many names, he said.

00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:06.960
 So many names.

00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:11.960
 Because since this raka, I'm using now as the dukki terminal in raka,

00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:18.960
 raka is free from the existing, non-existing, neither and either,

00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:25.960
 therefore it is known as matemaka, middle way.

00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:30.960
 Not any sides, not any directions.

00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:36.960
 Therefore it is matemakas.

00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:40.960
 So this is matemaka.

00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:44.960
 We are going today, the dukki teaching is again,

00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:49.960
 teaching to the cudepkad, right to the balls up.

00:59:49.960 --> 00:59:54.960
 It's not coming from outskirts, gradually to the center.

00:59:54.960 --> 01:00:01.960
 We are exploring from the center going outward, word.

01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:04.960
 Therefore it is an essence of matemakas.

01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:07.960
 That's what the Thad Kannamma said.

01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:10.960
 Again, more of again what he said.

01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:15.960
 Sense is free from all the conceptions.

01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:21.960
 This raka is free from all the conceptions, all the analytics.

01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:29.960
 Therefore it is matemakas, sorry, therefore it is Mahamudas.

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:35.960
 Therefore it is great Mahamudas.

01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:44.960
 It is free from all the analytics, free from all the conceptions.

01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:52.960
 That which is again, talking our own innate nature of the Mahamudas.

01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:57.960
 Then what again he said, this great Master says.

01:00:57.960 --> 01:01:04.960
 In this space, in this awareness, everything is completed.

01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:07.960
 Everything is completed.

01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:14.960
 That means the samsara is completed within this awareness.

01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:20.960
 Narvana is completed within this awareness.

01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:25.960
 Therefore it is known as great completions.

01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:31.960
 Which means another terminology of zokki, zokki in it a bit.

01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:34.960
 All is completed.

01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:43.960
 That means what? All the parts, all the bhumis, all the stages, all the teachings.

01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:48.960
 What the great teacher Buddha Shatyamuni gave is all completed.

01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:51.960
 And some other teaching, those many great Master said.

01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:59.960
 Buddha gave all those teachings, 80th portfolio namah, standard of teachings of the Buddha.

01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:07.960
 80th portfolio with different teachings, variety of teachings, give only to explore this.

01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:12.960
 Explore all this, with this rupa, the awareness.

01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:19.960
 Tatha natha natha natha natha, Buddha nature, terminology or Mahamudara, Madhemaga, or zokki.

01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:23.960
 That is what really he gave all these teachings.

01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:28.960
 So therefore, the rupa is the old in the nature.

01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:31.960
 Our fresh nature.

01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:33.960
 It is Buddha nature.

01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:38.960
 And we behold this Buddha nature as great Master Mohanudya is saying here.

01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:50.960
 Here, here we are beholding Buddha right with, right this instant.

01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:54.960
 What Buddha is? The Dharmakaya Buddha.

01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:57.960
 We are really beholden.

01:02:57.960 --> 01:03:03.960
 Dharmakaya Buddha, we are beholding, we are recognizing.

01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:09.960
 In order to discover, to maintain this, then the teaching says.

01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:17.960
 I mean, all the great Masters, one voice will include the Buddha Shatyamuni, the good foundations.

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:20.960
 All the Mundo practices.

01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:29.960
 These Mundo teachings, Mundo practices, is not a discursive or obstacle course for our practice.

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:35.960
 It is a reactivating, preparing tree, a just entry.
