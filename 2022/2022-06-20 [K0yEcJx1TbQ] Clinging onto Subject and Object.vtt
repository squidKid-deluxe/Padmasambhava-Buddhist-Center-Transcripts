00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.280
 "I, Kuntuzango, when this energy arises, I immediately recognize, and I call enlightenment,

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:17.680
 but sentient beings didn't recognize it instantly, and they kind of cling on the subject and object

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:17.880
,

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:25.400
 and then they kind of dilute it, dilute it, and they lack the mindfulness or thelessness,

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.080
 and because of that, now what the sentient beings, they are constantly doing something

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:39.800
 this thinking is good, but reality is more obscuring our self. So, kind of all that occurs,

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.120
 the other people. And this is different, six different activities, and that it looks like

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:52.040
 same as going through the nightmare or the dream stages, just endless nightmares, endless

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:58.400
 dream stages, even though it's not really solid existing, concrete existing, but truly

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.240
 we are really going through this. All the sentient beings are going through it. So therefore,

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:08.520
 I, Buddha, summon the Buddha, a Buddha, a person to put him or your Buddha, in order

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:16.960
 to benefit all the beings of six realms, I, by the power of this, my praise, as with its

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.560
 spray of the Kunduzangho, this, may every sentient beings immediately reach to the enlightenment

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.720
 or back, returning back to their organ state of the Buddha-hood. Really, we think that's

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:35.200
 strongly in the heart and mind, so that is the last ones there. And then again, this

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:41.880
 is the final ones, and how this, we should do this praise, who will do this praise? And

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:50.360
 those are the, Aho is again, our joy, exclamations, and happy in joy, this powerful praise of

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:57.200
 all of this teaching I met. I able to receive this powerful teaching, now how I'm potent,

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:04.080
 how I'm potent, how I'm blessed, living with that attitude. And then he said, in the future,

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.760
 with powerful yogi in the yogi-ness, who will do that with powerful yogi in the yogi-ness,

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:15.000
 who has some realization and understand of the Zokki teaching or the meditation of the

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.400
 bodhicitta, bodhicitta, relative to bodhicitta, absolute to bodhicitta, then they are powerful,

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.680
 powerful yogi and yogi-ness. And when they have, when that, those people individually,

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.640
 but even you don't have those realization, with a clear mind, with devotion, with confidence,

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:40.640
 with stone presence of the bodhicitta, and as well as all the bodhisattvas of every light

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.640
 being, and do this praise. And keep this, that how it is. With a clear mind, with any awareness,

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:53.600
 with all the delusions, and perform this powerful praise, this powerful praise of the absolute

00:02:53.600 --> 00:03:01.200
 truth, powerful prayer of the Zokki practices, powerful prayer that will reconnect back us

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:09.600
 to true nature, where we belong. So therefore, it's powerful. And when we pray this, pray,

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:18.000
 what we pray? We pray this that the kundasango praise. And also, whoever heard this praise,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:27.400
 praise, all those who heard it, and what result? Result is, after three rebirths, they will

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:34.920
 get enlightenment. That's the kundasango, in a way, granted. After three years, after three

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:41.120
 light times, they can get enlightenment. And then, particularly time, when it's good to pray,

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:49.040
 and how should you do prayers? And which, how? And that is, time is, if any time is so good,

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:55.480
 but particularly, for example here, time of the collapse of the sun and moon, when the sixth sky

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:04.840
 hundreds, all the earthquakes, or the, yeah, during the earthquakes, solstice, or at the beginning,

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:12.640
 or the changing of the years, those are the perfect times. How we should practice that? At that

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.940
 time,

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:19.520
 if you can visualize yourself as a Buddha, some of the Buddha, that we have many times as tankas,

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:29.040
 tankas, that means, our own inner requires, awareness of kundasango now transformed, exactly

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:34.840
 the Buddha. So now, we are not just, we are imitating something, we truly were Buddha,

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:42.320
 we went here to study, there is a different aspect of emanation, or just kundasamos. Our nature is

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:48.800
 kundasamos, our own awareness. Now, our own awareness transformed as the Buddha, Samhita Buddha.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:56.640
 But, and really see clearly with confidence, with joy and devotion. And then, you can also think,

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:04.080
 think that kundasamos, even you can think, quite big and strong and illuminating powers, and all

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:10.570
 that, and then, joining these prayers. Here, see, the recites, these prayers, they're all well-

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.640
heard,

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:17.520
 everyone heard. That means, what is everyone? All the beings of six realms well-heard this.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:24.400
 When you like to meditate, when you join this, you think, all the beings of six realms are hearing

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:32.000
 these teachings, hearing these teachings, these prayers, essentially. Then, it really will help

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.840
 to, it will help ourselves, one who is residing, it will help with others. Others, and perform

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:39.040
 these

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:46.080
 prayers with the yogi, and yoginis, who are that? Oh, that. Every day, you're not yogi, and the yog

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.160
i

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:51.850
 is in that realization. But, you pray this. That is really what it is. It will release the suffer

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:52.640
ings.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:57.760
 Oh, that means suffering, cause of suffering too. All that will release, immediately,

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:02.400
 and eventually, they get enlightenment. And you can get enlightenment. So, that is,

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:08.880
 and then, this call of honor, thus is, we already read yesterday, this one, thus is said. So, all

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:15.120
 these call of honor, and thus is really teachings on the kundasamos prayers, and thank you,

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:28.160
