00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.200
 "The great master of Chiang Runbudin, he used examples, such as the unpleasant sound of the pox,

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.320
 the pox's sound, as well as the crow's sound."

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:23.240
 "That's what he said, so he's always following, according to the villages of our areas, or in Tibet

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.560
."

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:31.560
 So they must talk in villages, talk about the pox world, the pox, the sound of the pox, and as well

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.560
 as the government.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.560
 When the government is talking about the pox world, the government is talking about the pox world.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.560
 The government is talking about the pox world.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.560
 The government is talking about the pox world.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.560
 The government is talking about the pox world.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:51.560
 And because in our area, the usually when the pox are talking about the pox world,

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:59.560
 in the night time or in the certain evenings or like that, pox make sound.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.560
 And villages, when they hear this, oh, this pox make noise.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.560
 Almost they check that as bad omens.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.560
 I mean, it's just their sound, so they're not really happy.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:20.560
 So therefore, he's just following that instruction, such as the unpleasant sound of pox.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.560
 So they cut that, ah, ah, ah.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.560
 And then in our villages areas, also they use the crows.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.560
 So they don't like, the crows always say what this is, ah, ah, ah.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.560
 And then into the way, the ah means what, what, what.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.560
 So the crows are talking all the time, what, what, what.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:59.560
 And then what we were in this country, songs, such as maybe I heard or we heard many times,

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:08.560
 the garbage truck sound, don't like, the garbage truck is making such a bad noise all the time.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:19.560
 So maybe the garbage trucks, trucks, garbage, those songs.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:26.560
 And then maybe also in this country, the cuckoo sound maybe is not good, because it's cuckoo.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:38.560
 Because it's never heard cuckoo sound here, but even in the east, cuckoo sound is very happy with

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.560
 the cuckoo sound

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.560
 and that is called the sign of the spring is coming and then even the sun.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:03:11.560
 Cuckoo sound hurts and at that moment, all the animals become their life force come back.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:19.560
 They use it because it is in high altitude and winter is long and then, and so it's all frozen.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.560
 But cuckoo comes in springtime and that really shows now spring is coming soon, there's more grass

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.560
 and all that will come.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:33.560
 So animal won't die and always, the village you say, oh, that really makes a stronger moment.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:40.560
 You heard the cuckoo sound, that moment, life force of the animal, domestic animal, is stronger.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.560
 They say that sound.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.560
 In the Tibet, they say the cuckoo sound.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:55.560
 The cuckoo sound is called cuckoo.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:04.560
 And then in the Sanskrit, it's called cuckoo.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:10.560
 And then in another synonym of the cuckoo is in the literature already said,

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.560
 "messengers of the spring queens".

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.560
 Or "messengers of the spring queens" or "cuckoo herself is a queen of spring".

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:25.560
 We're going to say cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:39.560
 And in the sound of a cuckoo, we say this is the one that you can hear, cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:45.560
 We heard the cuckoo sound in Russia.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.560
 Russia, definitely.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.560
 So it must be in Europe too, all the Europe's.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:56.560
 Yet somehow it didn't close the Atlantic Ocean to here. We never heard a cuckoo sound here.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.560
 But Russia, definitely, is good.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:21.560
 And then the very worst and unpleasant sound is then here.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:31.560
 A very unpleasant word is then kind of criticized to you, such as "dummy", "stupid" or "ugly".

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:38.560
 And you, a bad person, I mean, any of those are then very unpleasant.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:46.560
 And then what it brings, brings when we heard this noise or the sound,

00:05:46.560 --> 00:06:01.560
 it brings immediately the conception of the thought of rejection.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:07.560
 The conception of rejection thought, when it comes to rejection, comes.

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:17.560
 Instead of following up with that conception thought, immediately look to that conception,

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:28.560
 that rejection conception, like to be rejected, or unacceptable conception.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:37.560
 And not giving up or holding that, nothing. Just immediately look to that point.
