00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.440
 Welcome everyone and thank you again and with us. Now I'm going to talk a little bit of teaching

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:17.840
 on the way, slowly of this teaching by the great master of His Holiness Dudjoom Rinpoche.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:26.640
 Just a few lines for every day then for this time. So I'm just going to speak this. I'm sure

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.680
 many of you already have this copy and so you can look to these facts and I will go over this.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:40.560
 The first I talk a little bit about His Holiness Dudjoom Rinpoche and many of you already know

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:48.000
 that but even you know we just remember of this one of the great masters of the 20th century

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:59.600
 of the Tvit Buddhists and he was so beautiful humble and simple, daunted art. Even though he's

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:06.000
 one of the great master, honored by so many great, I realize that the base of honor comes to you

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.240
 but

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.880
 yet he's so humble and simple. That's what I'm saying, daunted art. He's not just a kind of like

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:19.840
 sanctity because he's a great master, he kind of acts that way. He acts so simple, so ordinary,

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:28.320
 so kind of like casual and he meddles with all the every students, particularly those who are

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:37.840
 weak and uneducated person. He's so more kind than even same looks to the others. That really is so

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:45.280
 humble and simple and yet his knowledge, his realization is so brilliant and powerful

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:53.520
 and his kind is a compassion. It's just an overwhelming thing. He was also predicted by

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:00.800
 Guru Pemma Sambhava in the 8th century, his upcoming and as Guru Pemma Sambhava predicted

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:14.980
 he was born in the 19th of Tov in southern Tvit, the hidden body, the sacred land of Guru Pemma S

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:15.680
ambhava

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:22.720
 known as the Pemma. He was born and he grew up there but immediately the moment he was born,

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.640
 he conserved in the mother's womb, there's so many extraordinary things happening around

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:36.960
 around family and around the area and the villages and he was born and beautifully and part of the

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:44.480
 child without giving any difficulty to the mother and he was born and as a grown-up he did so many

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:51.360
 great works, works to benefit for all the sentient beings, to the teaching, to the dharma and he

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:57.840
 became the one of the principal teachers, master, all the peoples, everyone devoted person, not

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.160
 just the

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:05.520
 only the great master's really, he's the teacher of everyone, everyone and that's what really he

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.000
 was

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.520
 and he was great scholars, he was great partners, he was great historians, he wrote over 25 volumes

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:20.880
 of the books, books that which is now combined and published there. So this is the great master's

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:28.000
 and he has many many numerous teachings that explain essence of the Buddha teaching

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.960
 and vanishes the heart of the devoted practitioners. So simple, so simple, easy

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:40.400
 and kind of complicated teaching but absorbed so easily in the heart and mind and this is the one

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:47.920
 of the his teachings and then many of you all have this. So I'm going to talk about these teachings

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:57.280
 and so this is the, here like this is the one of the, he's the writing, he wrote this letter,

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:04.880
 senator is one of the students, student and is named here, Lama Dawa, he's still alive, he's

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:11.840
 very one of the really beautiful practitioners, helmeted yogi still alive and he so he wrote this

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:20.720
 teaching to this devoted student of him, the Lama Dawa, Lama Dawa's. This is similar

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:27.520
 as like Navarjuna wrote letter to his friends, similar many times the great master's write

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:34.000
 letter to send that to the students as they are close it and that kind of, so during their

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.080
 retreat the practice though can have the really something special arsenal blessings that can

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:47.200
 sustain and activate their realizations practices go smooth. So this is one of the

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:55.120
 these teachings. Teachings and so now here see first I mean I got these first three lines

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:02.990
 dedicated to the practitioner at the yamne shoes so that explaining area where yamne shoes is the

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.760
 area

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:12.960
 where this lama is doing practices. This lama, Lama Dawa is also disciple of the very famous

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:21.120
 nima master, the master known as his wholeness Chhadra Rambojir or the Chhadra Rambojir, his

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:30.560
 student too. So Chhadra Rambojir is organized and he and he is guiding the retreat like a retreat,

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:36.640
 three-year retreat, three-year retreat and Lama Dawa was one of the retreatents in that

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:43.600
 retreat center and his practicing. And yamne shoe is the very famous

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:51.760
 central mountain central cave where Gopin Masambhava attained the realization of the

00:05:51.760 --> 00:06:00.400
 Vaidya Kalya. Kalya or Mahamudra state, or Mahamudra Vida Dara state, state he achieved that. So

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:00.720
 here

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:08.000
 he said how this that area how this Lama Dawa is practiced. He said the poor kind of ones you have

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:16.240
 again he's reminded you are the poor kind of ones generally he is having the beautiful life

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:22.720
 and the beautiful human human life is very fortunate it's not just kind of simple easy to

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:32.000
 get it's very special that we all know and we all are fortune ones truly everyone is fortunate

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:40.160
 everyone is very very very like lucky lucky that we have this opportunity and similarly Lama Dawa

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:46.960
 and not just only they have obtained beautiful human body or precious human body but you are

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:54.640
 dedicated to practicing and activated teaching into the heart mind that makes even more precious

00:06:54.640 --> 00:07:02.000
 you have taken the meaning of the lives the various lives for that reason I give you this

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.720
 instruction

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:10.400
 with the love from my heart that means with affection with love with personal caring

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:17.360
 thought I will give this advice to you but here his only the new motive mentioned to Lama Dawa

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:24.000
 but reality to all of us this is the message of from his own to the new motive to all of us

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.680
 not just the only one this is the one really how we should follow our practices how we should

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:38.240
 activate our the teaching with the disease or the empowerment we received so that is the post

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:48.080
 few lines of that kind of in a way history of how this teaching came came and now we go with

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:54.800
 these portal lines that is the belief actually teaching begins this but we are again to speak

00:07:54.800 --> 00:08:01.520
 of the teachings always in the teaching said what when we practice and as you all know

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:07.200
 we receive the teaching always correcting our motivations

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:16.240
 motivation is so important and motivation is good correct motivation is so important

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:23.520
 when we resume in the teachings when we are starting the teaching when we meditate in the

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:33.280
 teaching on practice with practicing always have good motivations why motivation is so important

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:43.200
 because mind is the principle of our that means what our what we have our sub means

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:51.920
 body verbal communication is active talks and mind those are in the teaching open name

00:08:51.920 --> 00:09:03.520
 the three principles that symbolize individuals body speech and the mind these three among that

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:12.320
 three the mind is the most powerful mind is the ruler of that for those reasons always in the

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:18.880
 teaching said at the beginning of the very practice the meditating or or starting the teaching

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:19.280
 always

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:23.360
 have the good motivation what kind of good motivation we should have

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:31.200
 motivation generally there's so many motivations but among this time good motivation what is that

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:39.280
 good motivation best up on the joy in the appreciations love and kind is a compare your thought

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:45.520
 that is known as good motivation that is the positive motivation

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:54.320
 when we have that good motivation everything turns into good good so therefore

00:09:54.320 --> 00:10:00.320
 mind is so powerful mind is so important but therefore positive joy in the application

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:10.160
 application as i said alien and you all know no to obtain this human body is so special

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:17.760
 we had a beautiful life even though we're going this challenges that but this still there's so

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:25.280
 many things to fill up in joy to ourselves our situation our circumstances so feel happy in joy

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:32.960
 joy of this then this joy is not just only kind of a light in our side but we're going to share

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:40.800
 that joy application and to all the living beings with the compassion with the loving kindness

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:48.320
 which is often known as then both each other mind of enlightenment really wishing good things to

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:54.960
 every living beings that is always necessary actually buddha teaching is you all know

00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:02.560
 it's teaching of non-violence teaching of equal limits every living being is equal

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:10.720
 and every living has because equal why they have so many levels we are equal every levels

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:20.720
 feeling level equal equal our desire level equal equal and wishing level equal whatever we're

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:29.600
 wishing same we are wishing same wish good things to everyone oh our self and we no one wanted

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:35.840
 sad and suffering difficulty we are equal and the potential level equal the direct teacher

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:44.880
 buddha hektamali said everyone has same potential same nature as buddha himself there's no

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:45.440
 difference

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:54.560
 so therefore physical level level we are equal biological level we're equal and

00:11:54.560 --> 00:12:02.480
 feeling level we're equal natural level we're equal and we share the same planet or same goal

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:14.880
 same a same sun same moon same water therefore we share everything same thing for that reason

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:24.640
 everyone want happy and peace and joy joy and that therefore for us following the teaching of

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:30.880
 the buddha hektamali really for that reason we wish everyone is happy peace even for example

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:36.610
 together we are practicing listening and reflecting teaching we that may become the one of the

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:36.960
 great

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:44.720
 souls souls and cause to remove all the suffering the difficulty tumbles of the world right now and

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:50.720
 beyond the world why i'm saying beyond the world because the greatest teacher buddha hektamali

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:58.160
 explained there's six realms even though many of them maybe we don't see immediately but there's

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:04.880
 six different realms those realms and even that whether we see or we don't see we share the same

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:15.360
 same feeling same thing same desire desire so therefore wishing happiness wishing good things

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:21.520
 with the body together it is so powerful that is hard essence of the teaching of the buddha dharma

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:28.000
 particularly the mahayanas then many of unique practice maybe very early on too then often

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:34.880
 teaching said also brain realization of the perfection status reality or true nature where

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:41.840
 things are in the in the reality levels reality level according to teaching everything is

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:48.400
 enlightened status those are known as the three radial status or the three kaya status

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:54.400
 that we read in the book and it received the teaching from the great masters masters some

00:13:54.400 --> 00:14:03.280
 some intellectually where we also understood what that means realities is everything is in that

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:10.800
 period state so without the kind of interference of the duality and a skeptical hesitation

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:19.920
 bring that kind of divine the purity dawn of light in our heart can see everything purely status

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:26.560
 and it's everything is purely state our mind is a love and a kind is a competitive with full of joy

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:34.000
 in the application then we create a really beautiful in a way pure land our perceptions

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:41.360
 our conceptions we make it pure beautiful there's nothing higher and a better field than a love and

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:48.000
 kindness and compassion compassion love and compassion that don't have any boundaries

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:58.000
 restrictions raise it to every living beings freely all good good heart prevail and the whole

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:05.520
 universe and space is so special so beautiful that week is the very foundation of the buddha

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:13.840
 teaching and our practices that we should always try to remember that and even fail out from there

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:20.480
 trying to bounce back to that stage of that platform or that status that is known as the

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:29.520
 practice of the dharma so that is so important and that is really my my brief talk today and just

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:37.040
 reminded to all of us and also maybe i'm going to follow the the schedules what we planned to do

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:43.840

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:51.120
 and then the meditation thought to do but now we do together the meditation as all you do see the

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:56.880
 teaching you all receive the teaching your own practices now really we do the meditation and

00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:03.680
 again when we do the meditation we should have the same body vector joy and appreciation and

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:09.680
 both each other we meditate in this may really become the one of the greater cause to benefit

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:15.440

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:41.920
 special devotion is me there is no skeptical no hesitations no kind of like doctors that

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:50.320
 interfering our spiritual deepening practices you are embracing the reality nature where things are

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:57.600
