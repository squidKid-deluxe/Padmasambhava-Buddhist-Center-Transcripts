00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.320
 When we follow these texts, again as in the great masters of Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche,

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:13.280
 we should always tell many talks, and as well as I had great opportunity to meet also and

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:21.520
 receive some other teachings from great other masters, and they always explain as very

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:31.680
 lineage systems. So I like trying to follow my best capability to that systems. In that way,

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:38.560
 when do you understand that kind of let foundation lay out from that, and now I follow with it,

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:44.320
 with these texts. These texts, when you follow, and they always teaching said,

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:56.800
 this text has three meanings, kind of both divided in three, the beginning, middle and ending,

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:07.280
 concluding. What is the beginning? Beginning is title, middle is the principle topic of this,

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:14.560
 and concluding is then concluding of this text with girlfriends. Those are the three

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:25.200
 principles or the divisions of these texts. And so now, in that way, I follow with this title.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:36.880
 Title is the general meaning or aesthetic in the general meaning of the Madhyamaka, that is

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:51.360
 known as the enjoyment, enjoyment like, like L-A-K-E, like of Nagarjuna. That is roughly my

00:01:51.360 --> 00:02:01.120
 translations. So that is title. And now, I already mentioned about things, but however, again,

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:08.400
 then the post, this is a subject, it will come all, but now we talk about Madhyamaka. Madhyamaka

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:17.200
 is a Sanskrit word and translated into English, I think middle words, middle words. In a debate,

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:27.760
 it is known as Uma, Uma. And now, what is Uma, or what is Madhyamaka? And what is middle word?

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:45.920
 Middle word means not best to any extremes. Not standing on any, or not standing on any extremes.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.760
 Lyle is talking with him, he is just loud.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:09.440
 Oh, okay, oh, oh, this is what is called, excited, excited.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:18.560
 Buddha is already popular.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:27.120
 I told you, when you go to all those offensive department stores, you always see Buddha.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.960
 I mean many times, many times you see Buddha. So that means they like Buddha.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:40.480
 And this is how Buddha becomes a part of the patient. I hope Buddha will be going someday,

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:49.040
 running on the runway, or probably will see, on the runway, with a lot of many glamorous.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:04:00.880
 So anyway, okay, now back to our topic, Madhyamaka. Madhyamaka in Uma. Uma, again I said,

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:08.720
 is translated as middle, middle word. And now what that really means here, Uma, or middle,

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:22.480
 middle word means, means, means not standing on any extremes. Or, or maybe you don't have to use

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:32.080
 excellent, any places, any places that you don't. Who, who is not, who should not stand?

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:45.600
 Primarily talking about our mind. Your mind, my mind, not standing, not ordering anything.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:55.920
 If you're not ordering anything in your mind, then it is.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:07.760
 Pretty much Madhyamaka status. So that's not holy, not holy. That meaning, what the great master

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:18.640
 Buddha said in his great teaching, known as Samadhi Raad Satras, or sometimes is also known as

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:45.520
 Light Satras, known as Light Satras. In that teaching said, "Holding, holding existing,

00:05:46.560 --> 00:06:01.200
 not existing, both are extreme. And holding, this is clean, this is dirty, it is

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:15.920
 edge." The expert, or sorry, wise person, should not stay any of those places, nor even if you

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:25.040
 not stay in the center, should not stay even in the center. That is the what, is the Madhyamaka.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:39.680
 So that means, not free from the existing, non-existing, neither, either dirty, clean, neither,

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:46.560
 either free from that everything, even we're thinking holding the Madhyamaka or the center,

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:55.920
 that should not stand. Release that. When you release that, again you continue that text,

00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:09.840
 see it. Then you reach to the, it is beyond the world, beyond the level, beyond the sun,

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:23.200
 as like natural, like the sky. When you realize this natural, that individually knowledge will

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:34.880
 be bursted. Knowledge is not stopped. The wisdom is not stopped with any edge, it's free. That

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:45.040
 knowledge and the fearlessness, this is that in wise persons, the knowledge and yeah, knowledge

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:52.960
 and wisdom become the endless, infinite. That's what the great master says. So therefore, this

00:07:52.960 --> 00:08:01.360
 Madhyamaka means not just holding something here, not holding Madhyamaka or the middle.

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:13.600
 That released, that removed. Total free to every aspect of the grasping and cleaning.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:24.640
 As like middle sky. And for that reason, great master, Nanaarjuna said in his root tracks,

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:35.200
 with there is no edge, if there is no border, how should be their center? He used logic.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:44.080
 If there is no border, there is no middle. That is what Madhyamaka is.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:55.200
 That is the view. That is the view of the Madhyamaka and that is the nature of what it is.
