00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:27.050
 Thank you everyone again. Welcome. Welcome everyone. Thank you very much. Welcome to Palden Sherab

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.800
 Pema Ling.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:37.720
 This is the center of the sunshine state of this part of the beautiful country. I'm so grateful and

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.600
 thankful for all of you. Welcome. Welcome everyone.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:53.600
 And this is our beautiful Brixi land and beautiful Brixi land. We will be completely off and free

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.700
 by the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha. All of them will be free.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:04.620
 This will become one of the real places. They were beautifully cherished and glorified, the

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:11.150
 flourished, the teaching of the Buddha Dharma, that which means the practice of love, kindness, and

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.200
 compassion.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:21.630
 And that completely saturated themselves, ourselves, and as well as others. And continually ongoing

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.900
 until the samsara is completely emptied. All get enlightened.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:48.440
 So we thank you very much. Thank you everyone. Thank you. Thank you. Then today I'm going to offer

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.010
 the empowerment of the Gaurav M. Samboa, known as Odhi Fandana as blessings of this land,

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:54.430
 officially with again Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, Honguru, Devadakini, and Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, and

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.600
 all of us together as put inside.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:04.900
 Inspiration, aspiration, dedication. So this will become the beautiful spot, as I mentioned that.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:11.900
 So we bless this, only in the presence of all these enlightened beings and lineage masters.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:18.870
 So again, as I said, I'm going to offer you the empowerment of the Gaurav M. Samboa, known as the

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:28.380
 Odhi Fandana, or M. N. Gaurav M. Samboa, whether of prosperity and uprightness, and I don't give it

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.700
.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:37.770
 In order to do this, I'm going to give brief introductions for the empowerment itself. This is

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:46.030
 again the teaching of His only Dhul N. M. J. As I said yesterday, whenever you know, know, and also

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.700
 that will talk more, is coming here.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.520
 So I'm just going to follow the exact instruction that Gaurav provided, His only Dhul N. M. Samboa,

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:58.700
 when he presented the empowerment, these two, many hundreds and hundreds, both in the purpose.
