00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.840
 Good evening, everyone, and thank you very much for organizing this event and inviting

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:27.340
 me and Lorraine in this beautiful city once again, and also I had the opportunity to visit

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:33.520
 again this beautiful insight meditation and be here and discussing that with knowledge

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:39.640
 of teaching that I learned, and so I'm so grateful all those opportunities. Thank you

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.760
 very much, everyone. Thank you for coming. Thank you, everyone, okay? Thank you. Before

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:51.600
 I begin to talk, I'm going to join few prayers, which is prayers of all those great masters

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.280
 of Buddhism. They did this to removing, freeing the suffering, the difficulties of every living

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:04.000
 being in a very beautiful nature of the joy and peace and harmony. That is the meaning

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.880
 of these prayers, and I'm going to join those prayers tonight. So please, please, you all,

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:18.080
 we all meditate. Yes, and then while we are meditating, I'm going to join these prayers.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:42.880
 [Singing]

00:01:48.080 --> 00:02:02.480
 Okay, so tonight I'm going to talk about how to heal the sufferings according to the teaching

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:09.320
 of the Buddhist masters and what they practiced. And to do this again, just to talk really

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:17.760
 about what is the sufferings generally. The sufferings. Sufferings generally we're thinking

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:25.440
 of is something that unwanted feelings that we have to go through. Why it is coming, or

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.760
 why is it there? According to the teaching, or when we think of this, generally suffering

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:41.840
 is very natural. It's nothing alien and nothing bad. It is part of what we are, where we are.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:50.800
 It is like a season, when we have the different seasons, spring, summer, autumn, and winter.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:57.760
 When those different seasons come, what are those? Is something newly arrived, or is something

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:04.000
 kind of strange things? What are those generally? We start thinking. It's nothing, any strange

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:12.160
 thing. It is part of the systems where we leave this universe or this world. It's exactly

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:18.560
 the same way. If we want spring, or we don't want spring. If we want spring, we don't want

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:25.360
 spring. Or we have to analyze with the summer, season, autumn, and all those autumns, whatever

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:33.600
 the seasons. Even we like to do those things, but what we can do is part of the season,

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:40.800
 part of the nature. That's the way we are now. That is the part. Suffering is part

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:50.160
 of our systems. Not just only about suffering, we have also happiness. Happiness and suffering,

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:59.800
 that goes side by side. Is there something that suffering is invading us, or no happiness

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:05.960
 is escaping with it, or drowning away from us? It's a part of the systems. It's all

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:12.880
 that. If we don't too much analyze on these systems, systems, kind of take that as more

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:19.920
 natural approach, or natural rhythms, then we won't, I don't necessarily we will suffering

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:27.920
 too much as we suffer. And what is Buddhism called? It is samsara. Samsara has all these

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:36.400
 frustrations. It's not something that time we came in this world, time we lived in this

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:43.320
 world, there's always these play games of this something that we want, something that

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:51.040
 we don't want. It's all is going on all the time. This is also not just happening casually

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:59.120
 and randomly or without any kind of religious by itself. It's not. It has cause. It has

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:06.000
 conditions. Cause and conditions are bring up whatever that circumstance according to

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:13.240
 cause and conditions. If it's suffering or unpleasant, then that cause and condition

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:20.720
 must be played the role similar things what we don't like. Even though cause and conditions

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:26.920
 are times, maybe we don't pay attention too much. We're always kind of looking. Our human

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:32.560
 mentality or the in the Buddhism teaching always a duality mind is always picking up

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:38.720
 the kind of what the duality mind like to be, like to be that. We don't pay attention

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:45.800
 of the how it's developing in a bottom down on at the root, root levels. But this all

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:54.240
 happen is not just a happen by itself. I said it has cause and conditions. So samsara cause

00:05:54.240 --> 00:06:03.960
 is samsara is is the result of this on stable situations, changing ups and downs. That is

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:12.000
 all samsara. And that's what the Buddha named as difficulty challenges is not just a Buddha

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:19.880
 named because is when that began to experience by us, it is difficult. It is a challenge.

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:26.080
 And for those reasons in Buddha teachings name suffering, suffering truth. Why the Buddha

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:34.400
 named as suffering truth? Because it's truly experienced. Whether that is the illusion

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:45.800
 or whether that is just whatever it is, we experience it is uncomfortable. It makes uncomfortable

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:51.960
 suffering and we experience that therefore is called suffering truths. So this suffering

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:59.720
 truth is not just a happen by itself. It has cause and conditions as I said before, and

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:06.510
 that you all know called things are not happening here just by itself. It has cause it has

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:07.440
 condition

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:14.280
 behind the scene on the scene and far beyond the scene far beyond that we see all that

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:22.760
 came together both that result that what we see is a result that cause of suffering that

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:31.440
 one thing that we can tell a result is suffering. Definitely it has cause similar with that

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:41.520
 something unpleasant, uncomfortable and kind of un peaceful cause and condition because

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:49.480
 of that cause and condition both result as as a difficulty in troubles. Then the other

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:56.700
 hand if it's happiness and good that also not just happen by itself. It has a cause

00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:03.280
 it has a condition it has every all same thing and the cause condition must be also something

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:09.000
 very pleasing something kind of appealing something nice and comfortable and that because

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:15.480
 of that then sis light and formulated and cooperated to each other those cause and condition

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:23.480
 right way and both the result as happiness and called happiness and goodness. So therefore

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:29.640
 that is what cause of suffering truth what the Buddha said in the teaching this cause

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:35.080
 and suffering truth and suffering truth is a part of the samsara. That's what we call

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:41.680
 samsara where there is a kind of rotating situation all the time that we cannot rely on anything

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:48.080
 is unreliable things always happening one after another. What we like to see is happiness

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:55.520
 goodness good things but that is not happening all the time. It's always kind of really changing

00:08:55.520 --> 00:09:02.360
 and all that going on and on and that is as I said before time we came on this earth or

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:11.560
 the time we was we born and time we will live we'll have this change changes always. So

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:17.960
 this is a part of the nature part of the systems part of the as as as I used example as any

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:25.480
 seasons summer spring winter and autumn it's part of the whole systems even we want to

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:33.480
 reject that we cannot cannot reject it's part of that and why we don't suffer with the different

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:40.360
 changing seasons because we accept it. We know these things we know that we not become

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:48.360
 tempted with this. Therefore what we do one is a according general level different levels

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:55.880
 of the Buddha's teaching how we transform or how we heal the sufferings how sufferings

00:09:55.880 --> 00:10:02.040
 there's a different levels of the teachings what Buddha taught as I kind of like remember

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:08.640
 or as used to the practice of these. The first and the most important is to transform this

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:15.560
 or to bring the heal the suffering. We all have to be strong we have to be strong we

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:23.400
 have to be courageous we have to become a fearless we should not be tempted. As I say

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:29.960
 to use the examples the seasons why we don't suffer with the seasons all changing of the

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:39.360
 seasons this is just a roughly examples because we accept it we accept it and we are not when

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:45.240
 we accept it we're not bothered by too much even though season is changing all time is

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:52.200
 changing but suffering is something that we don't accept and that means what in the Buddha's

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:59.720
 teaching said we become terminus always we are so sensitive and terminus we won't be

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:05.360
 always going to have the fears that we get sufferings we're going to get sufferings we

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:16.600
 get more fears more fear and more fears what this fear does it then has timidity timidity

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:24.680
 then so sensitive when you become the more sensitive in timidity timidity then suffering

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:32.800
 or the situation become so powerful so pressure so tense and then you just can kind of completely

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:42.480
 be corrupted so order to to first place to really heal the sufferings we have to be strong

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:49.920
 that is the number one the foundation foundation fundamental we have to stone courageous and

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:57.680
 we have to be think more fearless in the states we have to be as one's called never mind never

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:05.680
 mind attitudes we have to open heart never mind I'm going to go through this I'm going

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:12.120
 to take care of this at it cannot crushed me I'm not going to bother every you have

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:19.760
 bad attitude or not just you and we have that attitude that is what we called in a generally

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:26.520
 in the samsara or in war the warriors challenge in the difficulty comes when they take care

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:32.640
 of that something that that very very beautifully and that challenge the difficulty not crushed

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:42.840
 our self self that is known as warriors these war friendships the bravery is a hidden call

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:49.760
 it over our nature our nature of the mind according Buddhism is beautiful brilliant

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:58.760
 enlightened peaceful status is fairness status but remedy and this sensitive issue is bought

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:07.000
 by or bought by our duality or every I pink one kind of pink don't this is the ego cleaning

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:14.360
 ego self attachment self-centered thoughts always can relate can be very protected thought

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:22.480
 of our own self and then as much as we have that thought we become always timid sisters

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:29.600
 therefore instead that can open our heart be fearlessness bring up the our nature of

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:38.840
 the warrior ships our nature nature of the mind natural mind is beautiful brilliant enlightened

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:46.120
 pristine that's what the inner in it all those great masters great teachers from the Buddha

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:54.400
 everyone say nature of the mind is pristine beautiful he roving very very brave very natural

00:13:54.400 --> 00:14:01.040
 mind cannot be drawn by anyone's even the buddhas cannot do anything to the mind the

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:09.400
 Buddha is considering in the Buddhism the most powerful things that should kind of overcome

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:15.040
 complicate everything overcome everything and Buddha is totally kind of freedom to every

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:21.280
 nature kind of rule the natural as it is but even that brother cannot do anything to our

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:29.520
 mind we have that distinctly beautiful unique nature each of us own way distinctive that

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:35.600
 call it every bring up that call it kind of bring up that reality with the fearlessness

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:44.240
 and with the with the courage and our warrior ship is really entrusting in the growing growing

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:49.600
 and then we become powerful then suffering and all these difficult things what we think

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:57.480
 we not be crushed by we not have to begin too timid timid all the times we can easily

00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:03.880
 pass through that so that is a number of control very very fundamental have that attitude have

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:09.800
 that stone in the Buddhism do you see that if you have that thought you can transcend

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:17.320
 that the transcendent or free the suffering heal the suffering into the positives suffering

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:24.880
 is not all the time bad suffering is in a way message in a test of our courage our knowledge

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:31.280
 our understanding how we handle the skills methods that in other world then also other

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:37.840
 side another world another way look to the suffering is to cleanse in the our karmas

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:43.480
 cleansing the our negative it is it is we are purifying that so there is many beautiful

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:50.240
 aspect of the of the suffering is not suffering is always bad bad when you look and read the

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:55.800
 life story over all those great masters for example brother shakti muni's and all the

00:15:55.800 --> 00:16:01.800
 great masters when you read this life story when you look to that they are a compliment

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:09.280
 bought by the beginning of suffering suffering ignited their realizations suffering ignited

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:16.640
 their courage and commitment and that warrior ships then they become the great enlightenment

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:23.400
 is the buddha's bodhisattva's all that without that buddha without the suffering buddha won't

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:29.560
 become the buddha i call the buddhism without the suffering the difficulty troubles bodhisattva's

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:35.680
 the one who walks for all the living beings not become the bodhisattva's so bodhi this

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:43.160
 suffering is not something bad bad bad have you really turned the suffering for the right

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:50.840
 way it is the mostly powerful things there is no history happiness bought enlightenment

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:57.160
 at the beginning time happiness ignited the in life to call it there is no the suffering

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:04.040
 the difficulty challenges both this beautiful realization one after another to read life

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:10.800
 story of such as buddha shakti muni's buddha was totally fully reached youth for apprentices

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:18.440
 athletic beauty skill method the knowledge every in luxuries and now everything is that

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:25.480
 he has the best in that time but we see the suffering the difficulties of the subjects

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:33.680
 subject that has inspired him to become as a buddha as buddha's and then all those great

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:40.520
 masters that when you read life stories everyone is really become that great bodhisattva great

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:47.720
 in life beings because of the difficulty in the sufferings one after another and then

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:54.720
 for example kishanates jesus christ because also extended relative level he experienced

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:59.160
 a lot of sufferings through went through them through the difficulty suffering and even

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:07.640
 what they call the cross fight cross fight on the cross cross because of that it ignited

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:16.720
 the glorified him as the great beings and the save of the all the mankind's it's not

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:24.480
 just his relax on the beach and enjoy trying to get the sun tan's and you become the jesus

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:31.440
 christ i mean who is they stay and enjoy the result result area all those luxuries area

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:37.600
 and then become that there's no history you look you look all those great beings that

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:44.320
 what we cherish what we honor everyone went through those challenges and they didn't cross

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:51.400
 by that and really that rise up then their warriorships their glories their beauties

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:57.480
 their technique they said then not just a day that that affected so many million million

00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:03.600
 beings throughout the generations this is how they owe the sufferings the difficulty

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:11.880
 troubles something unwanted things happened that brought up that so therefore so many

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:17.840
 times in the teaching you say suffering is not the suffering but suffering is the great

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:25.020
 teacher great who give the lessons and bring up our worship our realization so that we

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:32.480
 can defeat it we can transcend it we can change our directions not just ours but also can

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:42.120
 help to the other being same way in that beautiful status so that is how this generally about

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:47.960
 the sufferings or these situations now i talk a little bit that generally in buddha's teaching

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:54.600
 what how this is and now in the tutorial about the generally now again to convey more how

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:59.840
 we deal with the sufferings how we take care of the sufferings there's many different teachings

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:06.560
 the techniques i mentioned in the buddha teachings and this is though again those are what buddha

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:14.760
 said in the teaching said but through the power of the power of the meat meat or substances

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:20.160
 healing the suffering through the power of the substances healing the sufferings through

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:26.920
 the mantras healing the sufferings through the meditation and healing the sufferings

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:34.880
 through the attitudes or other things so those are the different way again to deal more closely

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:41.640
 with the deal with that watershed with that that courage and confidence fearlessness and

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:50.560
 accepting the situation not dealing this so with that and then heal the uh the sufferings

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:58.240
 and first these substances secondly is like mantras cigarette songs and the third is concentration

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:05.480
 or the meditation and the fourth is like attitudes what we have two attitudes and this is now

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:11.040
 we talk about the substances substances generally now when we're thinking about the sufferings

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:17.080
 suffering is what is really actually one now looking to directly close to the sufferings

00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:22.040
 is suffering is object or is suffering the subject if we're thinking of the object the

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:30.280
 subject levels what are these sufferings suffering is not object is something is subject and

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:37.960
 subject when we start thinking a code of buddhism what are called five aggregates form aggregates

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:44.800
 feeling aggregates conception aggregates perception aggregates and conscious aggregates so there

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:54.680
 is five aggregates among these five aggregates what are these suffering is suffering is of

00:21:54.680 --> 00:22:02.240
 course is a mind but it's more related with the feeling it is a feeling aggregates so

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:11.000
 that is what the feeling what is this feeling is feeling is where feeling is how it started

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:20.880
 feelings it is it started with the mind started it reflecting to the physical it reflecting

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:27.520
 to the mentally so it reflected at least two major places started fundamentally started

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:36.540
 with mind and then is reflecting to the physical to the mentors so now that feelings and how

00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:42.720
 many feelings according to the teaching there is the many feelings thing is but can summarize

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:50.080
 all the feelings into three feelings those are the the the wanted feelings or please

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:57.320
 and feelings unpolised and feelings and the neutral feelings so now suffering is about

00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:04.200
 is unpleasant feelings something that we don't like to accept something that I don't feel

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:15.040
 comfortable comfortable that is what the suffering is so it is the feeling that on on on unpleasant

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:22.560
 feelings and when that how this reflecting that is a two major way to meditate physical

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:29.920
 and mentors physical way when this suffering comes then physical troubles all the physical

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:37.880
 troubles is can be summarized into the physical feelings mental feeling is something that

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:44.200
 not necessarily immediately started with it physically but it's mentally started mentally

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:51.600
 mentally is also kind of like mind is something that don't want accepted it's all thought

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:55.800
 mental suffering started with thought I mean it's all a cure of Buddhism if you read the

00:23:55.800 --> 00:24:01.280
 books of the Buddhism actually is all everything started with the mind particularly for example

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:11.440
 mental suffering or mental suffering is started the mind and how again don't like to even

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:19.800
 is a thought we don't like to accept that thought something that we highlighted we have

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:25.760
 trillions of thought goes through our our mental state or our brain states every day

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:32.200
 but among that trillion thought we highlight one and we don't like to see that we don't

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:38.680
 like to see that as you highlight we don't like to say mind is playing the double game

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:44.440
 and again it become more tense I don't like that and then you made this kind of a lateral

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:49.560
 not a concept of thought alone that trying to reject that but thoughts are coming back

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:54.480
 thoughts are coming back you trying to reject that and thoughts are coming bigger and bigger

00:24:54.480 --> 00:25:00.880
 so now almost the mind is playing two games subject and object event within within the

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:07.520
 mental states that is how the beginning of the mental problem or sufferings when mental

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:14.160
 problem sufferings comes that there is so many again psychological troubles mental problems

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:21.160
 emotional troubles I mean so for all that arises one after another all this way is happening

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:28.520
 that all is all is happening on the brain or the mental states all is happening when

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:34.480
 sense of mind is become so powerful it ruled the whole our environment mind is the ruler

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:41.200
 of the our all you are our environment sense is ruling then it is sizzling in the brain

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:46.400
 or the mental status it becomes stronger and strong then of course we need to become stronger

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:52.400
 strong and our wind according to Buddhism our wind is become more stronger the running

00:25:52.400 --> 00:26:01.040
 wind on the physical is become more strong more rapidly rapidly moving remind wind is

00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:08.240
 of running mind is joining and is going to circulate it through the old nervous systems

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:14.400
 brains cha and then according to Adyana or the esoteric Buddhism and the jakras and channels

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:22.280
 and all it's just still become then it created very arm please in the environment in the

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:29.280
 mental states mental states and that is known as then the mental sickness or mental feelings

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:37.840
 mental problems and that is as I said emotions related psychologically or any that all those

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:43.600
 troubles came on after that even though is mentally related that truly we go through

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:50.800
 that it's not something that is it's a male mind it is just it goes away because our mind

00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:59.200
 is supported to that our conceptions and support to what we started is continually maintaining

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:08.400
 and then it becomes the troubles so now how to heal this heal this this all this troubles

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:15.280
 if we divide again I went back to this what we discussed is forced to the this is feeling

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:19.600
 feeling can be divided into two in this time we're talking more about the feeling of the

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:25.400
 suffering or the unpleasant and the suffering has can be divided into two physically and

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:32.560
 mentally these two now how to heal to heal is as in the buddha sicham or those great

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:40.480
 master always said teaching the substances and then as well as the mantra meditation

00:27:40.480 --> 00:28:00.280
 and then substance mantra meditation meditation and then overall kind of attitude or how we

00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:05.560
 will take care of this this so those are the four things so now when we are the trouble

00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:11.280
 of this if we're looking through the point of the substance levels what means substance

00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:18.360
 levels substance a god of buddhism is for example all the medicines all the medicines arbor

00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:19.320
 medicines

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:26.120
 as well as like modern science developed the medicines what are your those relatively substance

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:32.720
 and our kind of like we're eating good food or the we have the living standard all those

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:39.480
 things are known as a substances so whatever for example to heal these things difficulties

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:45.560
 then go to kind of experts such as the doctors doctors they give their stockings whatever

00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:50.240
 they say whatever that those experience a doctor say according whatever you like to

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:58.120
 abroad abroad and that will heal it will help help so that is really known as then the helping

00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:05.680
 through the substances they have different medicines a different food and then medicine

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:13.920
 to be urban medicine or ancient ancient those technology the ancient those by the western

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:19.640
 mind develop the author or the experience develop the medicines and use those arbor medicines

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:25.160
 and all those anything that really with the substances if you take those take care accordingly

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:30.760
 that that and then target with that when they give also the instructions that you're where

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:39.720
 you're living where you're where your activity where your behaviors or our behaviors right

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:47.120
 you understand behaviors so all the conduct all these things is known as the substances

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:53.520
 so use those techniques and they apply that definitely it will help that so this is one

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:59.240
 of the techniques of the through the substances and then throw them mantras mandra is a secret

00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:06.120
 song the secret words to reward and there's many mantras again and throw the mantras then

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:14.200
 you can also heal that not just only the mantra according Buddhism mantra is goes with meditation

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:19.800
 not just you're reciting chanting something but also with meditation you're concentrating

00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:27.280
 with that so as you meditate reciting those secret words what it does it deep down is

00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:34.280
 really like clearing and touching to the our mental status mantra and meditation both deals

00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:40.960
 with the with the mind mind and that's what called the mantra is Sanskrit word if we translated

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:48.360
 that into English mantra means protector of the mind one protractor or civil sound there

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:57.240
 well protecting our emotion mind or duality mind that is what the matter is and so reciting

00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:02.160
 the mantra with the concentration with the meditations every reciting the mantra that

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:07.920
 when you reside in the mantra immediately it really affects us to the our our system

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:13.200
 of the all the chakras and channels it is when you reside in the mantra is not just only

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:19.400
 wobbling on the on the here but it's all going that sound systems are going all the way to

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:26.400
 the our physical systems so in the way mantra reciting mantra is like sound therapies therapies

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:32.040
 you're really going through everywhere and cleansing and a transcendent thing and then

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:40.440
 healing the all those scarves of the emotions or the feelings that really healing completely

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:47.480
 that and that is known as reciting the mantra practicing through that will heal heal and

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:54.920
 then through the meditations meditate meditation meditation is a code of Buddhism is very profound

00:31:54.920 --> 00:32:01.520
 because these are all generally this started with the this uncomfortable feelings start

00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:07.360
 with the mind mind so that it goes to the root meditation goes to the root and when

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:14.360
 you meditate that it really cleans away cleanse with that and then also during the meditation

00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:23.800
 generally there is also quite two three different ways the first of all that way when you started

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:30.120
 this meditating pause also in the Buddha teaching said this suffering is not just happening

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:36.720
 by itself as we said before it has cause and conditions this cause and conditions is maybe

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:42.840
 something really connected with us that ourself and a Buddhism you all know basically we're

00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:49.520
 not first time in this human world this is not our first time we are here we've been

00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:57.400
 here only samsara so many times lifetimes so many lifetimes that time we also did a similar

00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:05.720
 activities similar activities and that activity is known as that karmas karmas are not opposed

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:12.080
 nor is it not bad there is a good karma bad karma and a neutral karmas but this suffering

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:17.480
 is related with something a code of Buddhism is something that the action that which is

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:24.440
 not pleasing things at that time and because of that that shadow what we started it that

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:32.000
 shadow is a effect as now now so therefore is not just a happening by itself it is something

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:39.720
 that maybe has to do with our own action so now I'm going to purify that with that attitude

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:46.200
 with that understanding with that understanding we do the meditation meditation and then who

00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:53.040
 did that karma karma is no other than our mind fundamentally is our mind and who is

00:33:53.040 --> 00:34:01.000
 doing our meditation it's our mind so now mind is using the purifying what the mind

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:08.920
 did before is like homophobic systems using the antidote the same thing to remove that

00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:19.280
 obstacles or that that uncomfortable things so using the mind power and then cleansing

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:28.360
 healing the root of those suffering any difficulties so if you you must know those meditation and

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:35.960
 use meditate meditate meditating such as the chamadhi meditations inside meditations both

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:42.360
 are important chamadhi is very good because it was brained on our mind more settling more

00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:50.040
 gently more stable status inside the meditation will bring the whole whole inner natures it

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:56.040
 can't open in the window it brings the skylight to our mind mental state so we are totally

00:34:56.040 --> 00:35:02.920
 completely vast and infinite and freedom states relax on that nature states in that nature

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:07.160
 when it relaxes in that nature state even there is no even the names of suffering the

00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:14.920
 difficulties of existing at all is all healed all blended in all transcendent liberated

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:23.520
 within that nature status status that is known as the basically healing the by the meditation

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:35.920
 of the sufferings this and then this so that's a soul it aboard the substances aboard the

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:41.760
 mantras aboard the meditations that and then meditation also sometimes there's like such

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:47.520
 as zuktin meditations sometimes said that time you're not looking searching any of those

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:52.880
 the kind of thinking and like any anything that but immediately when we send this difficulty

00:35:52.880 --> 00:36:00.080
 sufferings immediately that time looking to direct to your own mind mind without kind

00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:06.320
 of going analyzing status immediately look into your own mind who is experiencing suffering

00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:13.280
 who is saying that it is suffering when you ask that question and look to your mind there's

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:20.640
 nothing really answers at all there's nothing you find and then you reach that is the kohri

00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:25.360
 doki teaching or the buddha teaching you teach the highest state of nature there's not no

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:33.200
 more answers at all you reach to the speechless states relax on that nature states is all mental

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:40.080
 publications mental games you relax in that they're freed out of that all and relax on

00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:48.880
 that nature states it is then known as a healing healing the sufferings suffering through the

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:57.920
 meditations levels then the fourth one is the attitudes attitude is again is when the suffering

00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:03.920
 the difficulty comes comes what we think you know most of the time we we kind of projected

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:04.400
 suffering

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:10.400
 the difficulty comes somewhere outside to us that's what we really projecting that most of the time

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:15.840
 and when this happening happening or that happened before and there's a effort now

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:24.560
 what happened to attitude we have to keep the attitude of the positives positives such as as

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:31.040
 that of this happening i'm going to not going to pay attention with this i'm going not going to

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:37.760
 for attention that with that at the same time i'm going to excuse that i'm going to forgive that

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:44.640
 forgive that i'm going to not bother with that now i'm going to let it go that happened happening

00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:51.600
 i'm let i'm going letting go this this case i'll forgive this or i excuse that have you have that

00:37:51.600 --> 00:38:00.240
 mental attitude that is positives we're cleansing and purifying that that at the same time is

00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:00.640
 healing

00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:07.760
 to us you're really giving that this is like our one of the very special attitude positive attitude

00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:14.800
 that we can forgive we can execute and we accept that that means you accept courageously

00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:19.920
 fearlessly you accept that and now you're not going to thinking of that all the time just let

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:26.560
 it go you forgive it you accept and when you do this what is called in buddhist it's bodhisattvas

00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:34.000
 that is bodhisattva you're not chasing that shadow shadow and let it go you're going to stay

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:39.760
 in the now and you're going to look into the future future not going to bother by what but

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:45.920
 what happened in the past or what happening now i'm going to look future future i forgive i

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:54.240
 excuse and i'm let i'm letting go this have you have this thought that is one of the very

00:38:54.240 --> 00:39:03.520
 beautiful attitude that we really healing the suffering and the difficulties also then another

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:09.360
 world also difficulty troubles when it comes according again another attitude that was the

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:16.160
 famous master known as the shanti devil he said in the teaching said this this one very famous he

00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:22.400
 said when suffering the difficulties happening to us again as he said before is not happening by

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:28.960
 itself it has cause and condition that so it's something because maybe we have connected that

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:36.960
 so now i'm cleansing i'm purified i'm cleansing i'm purified and i'm happy i'm going to i'm better

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:44.000
 i have to deal these things sooner or later i'm happy to deal now i'm cleansing and i'm

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:52.960
 purified i'm going to accept it is the same time when you what's called when we're cleansing that

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:58.560
 when we're cleaning the chimney chimney chimney or when we're clean cleansing the

00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:10.000
 septic systems when you clean the septic systems sure you we won't feel happy that smell

00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:18.880
 but we were happy we're cleansing we're cleaning it need to be cleaned one day also now the septic

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:27.040
 system or the chimney we it have to be cleaned one day so i'm dealing now better to better uh not

00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:35.280
 not to let it's better now than to let let i'm cleansing and therefore i'm cleansing i'm

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:42.720
 glorifying well i have the capabilities and with that attitude and really let it go let it go it's

00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:49.440
 true according to buddha's teaching this is not just happening by itself it's not just coincidental

00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:56.160
 suffering difficult it has many factors from our side from other side factors but if we let it go

00:40:56.160 --> 00:41:03.520
 except it won't create more more shadow more difficult things things so therefore then we

00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:12.640
 cleaned we cleared with that so and that is the what reason then this this attitude all is very

00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:20.000
 special way to heal suffering any difficulties difficulties and so that is generally kind of how

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:28.640
 healed very kind of like brief explanation or talk about how to heal the the sufferings and then

00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:35.920
 many times as i said suffering as i said quite a few times already that suffering is not really

00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:42.960
 always bad bad and suffering if you look to the other side of the suffering it brought so many

00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:51.120
 good results it gives us a stone makes ourselves a stone it makes ourselves more more kind of

00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:57.520
 thoughtful to the others it makes ourselves more humble and more humid more respectful it makes

00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:04.240
 better knowledge to our the whole the whole system of the world how things are and it gives then

00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:10.240
 ourselves more hardy stone more compassion in mind more soft to the heart mind and this is what the

00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:16.640
 sufferings does if everything is so good and all that we won't have this kindness the compassion

00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:23.440
 and thoughtful really things it makes ourselves more humble simple more down to the earth it is

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:30.000
 suffering is not always bad bad but of course when it comes to the earth then it's very difficult

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:35.520
 challenging those are different ways to understand we kind of overcome that and then you use that

00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:42.000
 suffering to grow our our natural natural realization to deepen our qualities to grow

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.960
 our beautiful quality of the fearlessness of love and kindness compared to the other beings

00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:52.880
 and it truly then it makes our self very beautiful beings in this world the shining stars that

00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:53.200
 really

00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:59.200
 we can help to ourselves help to our family friends and with that knowledge understand it so that's

00:42:59.200 --> 00:42:59.680
 how

00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:06.400
 the suffering is and how suffering we can heal the suffering you know something more positive

00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:12.640
 more beautiful more beneficial way and that is my brief talk about this evening if you have some

00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:35.280
 questions and i'm happy to discuss thank you thank you thank you

00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:42.000
 i was wondering about the comment that you made regarding when you are meditating and you ask your

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:49.760
 mind who is suffering and there's no answer immediately i'm thinking that no matter what

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:55.040
 there will be an answer i'm suffering this country is suffering these people are suffering

00:43:55.040 --> 00:44:05.120
 is there no answer when you practice a great deal or is that i'm just having a hard time

00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:12.480
 understanding that that is like for example particularly to heal our sufferings what it

00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:19.040
 said that when you ask that question who's suffering and every going really heavy our mind or

00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:24.960
 our self individuals are going very heavy hearted and mind and it is really making pressure to our

00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:31.520
 self that time you should think and this is the one of the techniques then you should think who is

00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:39.440
 feeling that who who is thinking that who is that thinker who is that thinker who is that

00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:47.920
 who feels feeling that every look to that to that that ask that question and look to that person

00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:57.840
 moment is to that to your mind right that moment then there is no answers that is like it's not

00:44:57.840 --> 00:45:03.760
 something that we're trying to hide and escape from the feelings but that is really the nature

00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:10.000
 of the mind if you look to generally every this object everything looks like a truly existing

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:18.640
 but if you look at every item in every this malakusa every this system there's nothing

00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:26.560
 extent substantially existing core at all to any things therefore is what in buddhism is called

00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:33.120
 relative truths all is it relatives all is relative there's no substantial solid existence

00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:39.760
 so this is the way that universe is like like as illusion magic the disciplines similarly

00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:45.840
 suffering the difficulty all these things are magical display of the illusions illusions so

00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:52.640
 now for example i'm suffering i'm experiencing difficulties that that that and all these things

00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:59.680
 but when that happen is strong tense thought thought happening then you ask who is me who

00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:07.360
 is me who is saying that suffering where is that me saying suffer if you ask that question put that

00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:14.080
 inquiry to your mind and to your feeling there is no answers and there's nothing that you can find

00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:25.280
 that is the like the space state of the preformed suffering that state is free from suffering but

00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:32.000
 due to our dualities it really due to our grasping cling in feeling and attachment to the sensitive

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:39.360
 it won't last long term but it is really you healing that moment that moment you heal that

00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:47.280
 all that conception or the feeling that suffering thought into the the wisdom or into the into the

00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:53.920
 great emptiness states into the states so you really the way this suffering come from actually

00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:59.920
 where that come from is also come from the the great emptiness or the great wisdom see so

00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:05.440
 so it went really back to that natural status now again due to our unfamiliar of the

00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:13.200
 meditation of a true absolute truth it won't last long time definitely that maybe next second it

00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:19.280
 will come back that and that but how even that's the one way to heal this but if you're thinking

00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:25.600
 of all the others and the sufferings are sufferings you can think that that technique you can think

00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:32.480
 but same time you really put lateral aspiration bodhicata prayers such as mantra of meditation

00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:39.120
 weak normal suffering such as in buddhist days in mahayana buddhist days called poor boneless

00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:40.000
 prayers

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:45.680
 may all every living beings from the preformed sufferings may they ever have the or always have

00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:52.240
 the happiness may they always stay the joy and they made the what's called if i join that whole

00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:59.360
 praise that's me may all sentient beings happiness and cause of happiness may all living beings

00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:05.760
 free from sufferings cause of sufferings may they always have the supreme happiness

00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:13.520
 which is free from sufferings may they always have the great equanimity understanding great like

00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:20.480
 equally understanding all the time so really giant kind of that kind of prayers we every

00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:25.600
 sentence means free from the all the suffering the difficult sincerely thinking your bottom of your

00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:30.800
 heart we there such as the prisms of with the buddhist and bodhist or in light join that that

00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:37.760
 is you're really sending the great healing healing message healing energies to whole world even

00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:38.000
 though

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:42.560
 it looks like so small but that i'm doing this maybe it's not an effort but according to buddhist

00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:49.360
 teaching that will have the ripple effect really it will affect to all everywhere it really will

00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:49.840
 help

00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:55.760
 that's help so this is a very special very good to do okay

00:48:55.760 --> 00:49:09.760
 yeah here's one

00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:22.480
 there is no

00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:36.400
 it's true in the buddhist teaching or i'm a coder in the true level reality level there's no i

00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:44.000
 i and then what do you say no suffering well if there's no i then then there can be no suffering

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:49.280
 there's no sufferings yeah that's true then there's no sufferings that's true there's

00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:57.440
 therefore have you ever read hard sutra there's a sutra called hard sutras there's more i there's

00:49:57.440 --> 00:50:05.040
 no all this teaching said and there's no sufferings there's no suffering there's no suffering

00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:13.920
 pre-formed sufferings true so all those teachings say this so it's beyond the all the levels of the

00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:21.710
 conceptions conceptions they're true is there's an according absolute absolute level in the budd

00:50:21.710 --> 00:50:22.000
hist

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:28.720
 buddhist teaching say there's no i is only on the absolute level on the relative level yes there is

00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:28.960
 i

00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:36.800
 there is you there's me even buddhist chaktamuni said i am staying in the water speak mountain

00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:45.360
 or i i am in a varanasi with my students but i see it so in the relative level truly there is i

00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:57.200
 but absolutely level there is no i as most of us think as thought so on the relative level

00:50:57.200 --> 00:51:02.080
 there is suffering definitely relative level suffering that's what we have to do healing

00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:10.000
 wow substance the healing mantra healing meditation healing attitude healing all those are on the

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:16.320
 relative level level and suffering is a relative level truly we have sufferings on the relative

00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:24.800
 levels yeah in the relative level we didn't i mean you we all know this is nothing something new

00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:25.360
 that

00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:32.000
 we have a lot of like difficulties and changes in our lives time we born as i said in time we go

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:38.000
 in the buddhism say the time of the time when we born is also when we're taking the birth even

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:45.280
 though we don't remember but our birth is not always pleasant it's not pleasant to the mother

00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:51.040
 it is not pleasant to the the child who's taking the birth and then when you grow up there is also

00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:58.160
 lateral difficulties self troubles and then getting old is not easy and then similarly

00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:05.680
 sickness is not easy and then leaving this body is not easy so this is those are like kind of

00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:12.800
 major uncomfortable things that we have to go through and then beside there is so many groups

00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:20.000
 of these these feelings it comes it is all definitely the relative truth relatives

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:31.040
 okay yes thank you yeah

00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:40.720
 it's funny just last night i was thinking about you leaving to that and

00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:46.240
 what i would consider incredible suffering that you went through

00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:52.640
 and it's really hard to get mine around

00:52:52.640 --> 00:53:04.160
 i mean there's such a strong compulsion to want fewer things to go bad in my life

00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:10.640
 want less hardship and then you know then i think of you and it's like oh you know it's nothing

00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:14.240
 compared to that but still um

00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:23.840
 i'm not sure exactly what my question is but it's like there's um

00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:30.160
 there's a desire to accept what is

00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:42.400
 but there's also a desire to have what is being nice

00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:59.600
 i don't know is it just just a it's like you know you're obviously it makes sense to try and

00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:02.080
 make things sort of nice

00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:13.360
 but it's like

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:19.200
 i get so tired of hardship

00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:28.240
 and definitely the suffering in the heart here is difficult really difficult but however

00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:36.960
 i think as i said said it's not just i'm saying this but it's true we all have to go through

00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:44.720
 this is not something that one is exceptional that even the enlightened beings an external level

00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:50.240
 of how they're feeling side of course is not really as we are what we feel is suffering

00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:56.240
 their feelings are different but external level they went through larger hardships and difficulties

00:54:56.240 --> 00:55:02.160
 and then we are going that and it took and within ourselves each purpose that's what in the buddh

00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:02.320
ism

00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:07.600
 called karma or buddha teaching say the karma but individually we all have the different varieties

00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:07.760
 of

00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:14.640
 the challenge and the difficult each each of us has these things and also we have very similar

00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:20.240
 kind of challenges that we all share together these things so so that they grew the level kind

00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:26.880
 of similar but individually again quite different these all go through this but was whatever it is

00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:32.880
 is i think that the mostly important that is the all the experience those great teachings say that

00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:39.760
 we have to really be very courageous and strong and accepting their situation and accept this

00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:45.120
 situation is really mean that we just live like that but with that acceptance we're trying to

00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:52.080
 solve the problem we're trying to heal the two problems that that if we do this and we use those

00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:59.920
 as kind of like reminders or the as like or make ourselves stronger and the courageous ones

00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:05.680
 to really help to the others others and they're kind of know that by our difficulties and the

00:56:05.680 --> 00:56:11.520
 troubles and the sufferings know that how others are going through that every seed is and kind of

00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:17.120
 their more more compassion and more kind more prey but trying to support and help with that

00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:23.680
 those all activity will also really will heal to our difficulty troubles too so that is really

00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:28.880
 what that you can heal yourself you're trying to heal others and support and help with that

00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:36.880
 that and then also same time as you said when you thinking of the poversa like kind of for me like

00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:42.160
 when we left it to be the all the more refuge and all these things in a frightening situation they

00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:47.360
 really go through this and it's not just that they don't have the troubles at all but they have the

00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:53.760
 all the troubles what we have now but beside they have troubles then losing their lives they're

00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:59.200
 losing their families immediately so they're escaping from the really dangerous place how

00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:03.760
 they're frightened and plus maybe they don't have the food they have don't have the cloth

00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:09.280
 wearing that so they have more extra troubles and difficulties also really that and seeing those

00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:14.800
 things that they can more compassion more kind they do lot of praise or whatever we can help

00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:21.280
 support in the accord our capabilities those are really known as then virtuous activity

00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:29.120
 and the dharma activity positive activity it heals to our self karma and the difficulty

00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:35.120
 it then benefiting to the others so those which is wonderful really wonderful and the same time

00:57:35.120 --> 00:57:40.400
 when we see those difficult troubles in other part of the world all this and when you look to us

00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:46.800
 then we also should have a lot of reason to feel happy and joy how great for how beautiful how

00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:52.480
 nice and it's like just a being great for great eat you too and you know all those things really

00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:59.360
 is important this is many times that's what the sufferings are reminding of our our joy

00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:05.440
 and our appreciation our great eat you to see that so so all those reasons the sufferings are not

00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:12.080
 like bad as what many times we think that is it has beautiful another qualities that really

00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:21.760
 brings the good things yeah i think there's an aspect of um maybe incorrectly assuming that it

00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:29.280
 means i'm doing things wrong yeah if i'm having troubles and and and so do you think that

00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:36.800
 what i'm hearing you say maybe is the key is to stop thinking about myself and and let the

00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:37.680
 suffering

00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:45.280
 help me develop compassion yeah that's really true of course isn't it mean that you stub yourself

00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:51.040
 thinking that definitely you have to think how to solve the problem your best capabilities whatever

00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:57.200
 the way to really make that more comfortable more easiest and that that definitely we need but same

00:58:57.200 --> 00:59:04.560
 time we should really also take that examples and then trying to also as much as you can help to

00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:09.840
 the other beings according in yandere in the buddha sichin or the great master shanti deva is one

00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:09.920
 of

00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:15.520
 the teachings the thinking of our sufferings and that kind of combined that we both each other so

00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:20.400
 my suffering become the main substitute the suffering of all the sentient beings every living

00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:26.640
 but not experience any sufferings because my this difficulty troubles and we have that courage and

00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:33.360
 confidence commitment and that is really again another big way to develop your courage your

00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:40.320
 confidence fearlessness and the same time is a great bodhisattva activities there's so many stories

00:59:40.320 --> 00:59:46.000
 that buddha give his own lives to benefit to the other beings even we couldn't do that stages like

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:51.920
 as that but at least our current situation suffering is what we're going through through that

00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:59.360
 difficulty kind of use that and may this become substitute of everyone's difficulty suffer

00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:06.800
 sufferings so that there never been any any no one is the uh suffered suffered like

01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:16.560
 what i'm i'm i'm that my suffering become the substitute of others and so is there

01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:26.480
 you know in the future or something a time when there will be suffering according buddha sichin

01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:34.080
 when you become the become buddha buddha then there's normal sufferings sufferings

01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:44.960
 that's true when you reach enlightenment when you when that means when you realize

01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:52.400
 the true nature absolute truth as it is when you realize that then even though it looks like

01:00:52.400 --> 01:01:00.800
 suffering but it's not really suffering even this is just like like use less example when you're

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:10.000
 dreaming now when you're dreaming in the nightmare if you recognize that nightmare is a nightmare

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:17.600
 it's it's it's dream it's not just really happening so then you won't have the pressure

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:27.280
 of the nightmare rather it become like playful playful so that's this is it so this is all

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:32.960
 that when we have the have the when we get a realization of the absolute truth exactly as it

01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:42.560
 is this is all display is all place shows even though there's absent wrong different things

01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:50.160
 but our mind had to understand what it is so is like playful is this like nothing really

01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:58.080
 absolute level happening before us this moment when these things happen is really true happening

01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:04.080
 happening is so solid it's so strong and so truth truth and then it's crashing crashing

01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:10.000
 reality level with a reality level whether you have the realization or not realizing

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:21.440
 reality level is like all magic shows all magic yeah all is magic all is like display

01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:26.880
 okay yes thank you

01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:39.600
 thank you thank you I have a question

01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:48.640
 that has to do with people who have spent much time and years in war zones

01:02:48.640 --> 01:03:01.440
 people who have spent years in a war zone and then come back and practice and meditation

01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:14.560
 purification by Drosophila and attitude correct attitude and do quite well Tomlin and also the

01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:26.560
 that may my suffering be the of all beings who are suffering the same at this very moment

01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:40.000
 but yet and can keep pretty present present state except for when something happens in

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:49.360
 the environment which immediately transforms the body back to that state of the war zone

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:59.200
 whereas the body is just gone with the reaction of a prior experience in the past

01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:05.280
 even to the point where your mind you can know that that's what's happening you're having a

01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:13.200
 flashback and you can go to mantra or various Tomlin practices or breathing even just trying

01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:22.960
 to bring yourself back but the body has responded so strongly that it's very hard to do that do you

01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:32.560
 have any recommendations or it almost seems like at that point the body is separate from the mind

01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:40.000
 I think so really I would say still even though that happening I will say still

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:50.240
 trying to keep up the attitude and as well as mantra meditation and all the health experts

01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:58.640
 healthy experts like the instructions whatever they really the best trying to keep up that so

01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:05.120
 I think really those are the best but keep the positive mind keep the kind of like courage and

01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:10.960
 like keep the hope I think keep the hope and keep the competence and with that and then

01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:18.880
 do the all those like spiritual like meditation mantra mantra then that and then together with

01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:26.160
 the expert those doctors and stockings really be strong and then also listen with a friend

01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:32.960
 family members how they they can help their kind of kind advice anytime if they have got those

01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:41.040
 really keep up that but shouldn't lost today or like vision or the goal or the hope and keep up

01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:48.160
 that still keep up the happy and the joy that I'm I'm beautiful human beings I'm good I'm just

01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:48.880
 really

01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:55.840
 don't feel that kind of like trying to not feel kind of like very hopeless and just like lost

01:05:55.840 --> 01:06:02.800
 everything really bring up that even we're going to to the throw that tunnel in a way a tunnel that

01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:08.400
 there is a window of light ever you you keep the courage and competence and your vision and the

01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:16.800
 goal identity up up that and keep the principles and or attitude really is I think it's really

01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:21.920
 important with that day this Dharma like spiritual meditation toning the breathing all those

01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:22.800
 wonderful

01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:28.640
 mantras that definitely help but this is it's just one of the obstacles obstacles we go through

01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:29.280
 this

01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:34.800
 even the great practitioners went through so many obstacles even we read the life stories

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:40.800
 like I mean all those great masters and in the ancient time now too I mean there's so many great

01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:47.600
 practitioners so masters when we read life story they had lot of also very kind of good days and

01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:53.520
 sometimes a very difficult hard days but their goal then they lost their hope or the vision

01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:59.360
 their identity their principle then they lost it and that really brought up that then that

01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:06.880
 become that so I will say the same way apply that techniques and just keep up that really that and

01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:13.200
 bring more trying to bring more joy more appreciation not looking always the weak side of the our

01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:13.520
 our

01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:18.720
 things what happened in the life we kind of not thinking but even though we can make the mistakes

01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:25.120
 we can happen these things happen we give excuse we forgive we accept it and keep the vision and

01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:33.360
 the goal I think really can change that we can turn that back yeah the forgiveness and the

01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:39.840
 acceptance is a big part and I know the neuroscience are saying well that mantra is one of the best

01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:49.360
 things that can be done my question is even with the acceptance and the forgiveness and the

01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:50.000
 practice

01:07:50.000 --> 01:08:03.200
 that it seems like the body sort of separates from the mind at that point yeah that could be

01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:08.080
 sometimes that could happen in that but definitely we keep the vision and we give the call

01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:16.800
 keep the goal vision and identity and still the kind of like keep the looking upward really not

01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:25.440
 just stone looking upward kind of held what's called head held high head held high and big stone

01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:33.360
 and keep drawing the things that what you need to be good or good to do what as doctor says really

01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:40.400
 that I think really we can change change that and that but however we should also all these

01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:46.640
 past things whatever happening things we have to accept that we have to accept in gender level

01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:53.040
 individual level and very personal level we have to accept and we have to accept and the same time

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:58.800
 let it go let it go don't there's many times those things are not holding back past our memories

01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:04.400
 past this and that thing as we hold back that then it just become the past we chasing still

01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:10.400
 the past now is that maybe happened many years ago many months ago i mean long time ago it happened

01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:16.960
 and still is bring back that it that that kind of shadows our destination our direction i think

01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:24.480
 really that so let it go give the forgiveness and excuse and let it go and then do the

01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:29.760
 purification practice of the various southwest and that i mean it's wonderful all that i think

01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:38.240
 really can change that that and just whatever that is also we're not so kind of like hesitate

01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:44.880
 status and just whatever the situation comes i'm happy and there's this one great master known as

01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:52.240
 in the tibet tommy's uncle he joined in his prayer or his song said one he got sick sick that he

01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:52.800
 said

01:09:52.800 --> 01:10:00.860
 if i'm sick i'm happy i'm cleansing terrifying my karma's if i'm not saying i'm happy i can do a

01:10:00.860 --> 01:10:01.040
 lot

01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:07.440
 of good things to benefit to the others so whatever it is is good for me that's what really he said

01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:07.520
 in

01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:12.960
 the teaching that and then there's a great master uh lung kimba he's the one of the again great

01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:22.960
 masters he said similar things if i'm dying i'm happy happy happy that is the journey of the dharma

01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:28.880
 kaya or journey to the dharma kaya if i'm alive i'm happy i can do that will continue to do good

01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:35.680
 things good activities is like narmakya status narmakya can perform lot of beneficial activity

01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:42.480
 so whatever the situation comes i'm happy and whoever making me trouble i'm very thankful

01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:48.000
 because they're the one who really push me to this status i'm now what i that's what i got this

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:48.720
 result

01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:55.120
 that statement so i'm thankful for all those obstacles and those uh man whom are troubled to

01:10:55.120 --> 01:11:02.160
 me i'm thankful to that and also he said this is truly really i mean when we think this really

01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:08.320
 what the achievement of what the result or what this great master god truly that's what because

01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:13.680
 that situation really bought all that things so then it becomes such an open mind and

01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:18.240
 freedom mind they're not caught in the hop in a pair like this just open

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:24.000
 what you just said brought me back to the songs of campo salter

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:35.360
 oh that's wonderful thank you okay

01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:44.640
 thank you for your teaching and your presence

01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:54.560
 sometimes when i meditate i get to a wonderful peaceful state with emptiness

01:11:54.560 --> 01:12:00.320
 and i don't know why it's up here but up here it's like my ego but some people are called

01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:06.240
 anybody kind of looks down on me to fold their arms and says all right now just take a few more

01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:13.040
 minutes of bliss a few more moments take a few more moments but then come back i know i know i'm

01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:17.760
 grouchy and i've got a lot of reason pain and anger and you're much happier there but

01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:23.920
 you know people won't recognize you unless you're out here being abandoned people won't recognize

01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:29.440
 you and then i go that's okay they don't have to recognize me it's much nicer here and then

01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:37.200
 the ego up here says you know he worked so many hours and so many years to get to this emptiness

01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:40.160
 and there's not going to be anybody to enjoy it

01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:48.400
 so if i just keep my back there and practice and try to ignore the voice would you have any words

01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:56.960
 that the empty me can say to the ego so the ego and the empty have a big debate i think

01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:02.240
 i think big debate and i think so you have to say i'm not going to listen to your ego

01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:10.720
 i'm not going to listen your ego i think maybe that's it i think this is

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:16.560
 i'm very happy that you made it any and i'm very those really good but however this is just a

01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:23.760
 little again testing or the hindrance that happening to you and that is what is really

01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:34.640
 the important not pay attention not pay attention at all it is fundamentally speaking it is display

01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:41.840
 or your mind display of your mind mind there's nothing is is all mind is playing that game

01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:49.840
 game and so therefore not pay attention and then is somebody also little bit is kind of like

01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:54.320
 handiness as i said that also happened for example buddha shakya money too

01:13:54.320 --> 01:14:01.600
 if you read life story buddha is going to get enlightenment that night for example you sit on

01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:09.520
 the another body today and a full full moon night and then meditating and then what there's like

01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:16.320
 according the teaching said the mara came that why you stay here underneath the body this tree

01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:23.920
 what are you going to gain what are you going to gain in in the back to home your kingdom is

01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:32.080
 completely controlling and controlled by or the ruling by the devadathas and many others others

01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:39.120
 so why you stay here what do you will gain here go back to home home and nobody will

01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:45.760
 appreciate you anything those really in the teaching said those all came that in either way

01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:51.600
 the obstacles so similar things these things are happening for example you or many also

01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:52.320
 practitioners

01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:57.920
 can experience these things but when that happened our confidence and courage are not really

01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:03.920
 lost anything and keep strong and when that happening generally why this happening many

01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:09.200
 times in the teaching say it is because happening that your practice is going quite good

01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:15.760
 when your practice is quite good you have those experience and our practice is not going at all

01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:21.520
 anyway we won't have any those experience so that is truly the sign of your practice is let it

01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:27.520
 developing and it's don't make getting let it stronger that's what this experience happening

01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:34.320
 is a lot don't let fell down or fall down on those obstacles or those like hindrance

01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:43.200
 really keep strong keep strong and be meditating in continuity and don't ask those questions

01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:50.640
 don't listen the answers any of those you trying to stay present state feel strong presence such

01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:55.680
 as the buddha shakya money money all all those in life to both the south of the city their

01:15:55.680 --> 01:15:56.240
 blessings

01:15:56.240 --> 01:16:03.040
 strongly and then just not even those feelings allow that merge to the your emptiness states

01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:09.040
 and the free from the ego state and the relaxed and that really i think is the best it will

01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:13.840
 that's what in the teaching said that's what we do thank you thank you okay

01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:24.640
 okay anyone yeah thank you i wanted to ask you about the the dreamlike nature of experience

01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:31.760
 you said really like the magical display so um the uh the playwright william shakespeare

01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:37.680
 in one of his places said the world where we live here is really just a stage and all of this is

01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:46.080
 just actors going back and forth it's a display it's like a story so um i wanted to if you'd say

01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:52.480
 something about the self because uh there appears to be all these selves we relate we have friendly

01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:59.200
 relationships but you were saying to look inside to see if that's self the way the story we have

01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:06.000
 that really is true so that the story we have of self myself if i look at that it's all bits

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:12.880
 and pieces there's no there's no solid thing there stories and stuff but in in the tantra

01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:19.840
 with the empowerment to a dt then you have introduction you can be a different actor

01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:27.280
 it's like this actor this this mask and this costume this body that can be like a divine being

01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:32.320
 and play with other beings and do little things to make them happy and see them as enlightened

01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:39.680
 beings and when i do that for a while there's the regular self i forget it's a much nicer act it's

01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:46.080
 much more fun to do so are you saying so this examining this hard self if we look at it and

01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:53.680
 let go or be more playful see more as magical display that immediately leads the suffering

01:17:53.680 --> 01:18:00.320
 so that's definitely yeah yeah yeah that's definitely when you have when you when you

01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:04.880
 bring that realization or when you bring understand of the you become the divine

01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:12.960
 or boring according to vagina and stochine and then whole universe is transformed or in that state

01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:20.720
 as a divine state it's not just myself is in that status that whole everything is in in that divine

01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:27.520
 status so so that when we have that realization when we keep that mental state of meditation

01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:35.120
 then definitely it changed or there's nothing any uncomfortable or anything it's all is like

01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:40.880
 playful natural status really truly that is like definitely big transformation that is immediately

01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:47.600
 transforming suffering into the into the great divine mandala or the samsara is immediately

01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:56.160
 transforming in the divine or the buddha mandalas mandalas and that is also according by jana tiki

01:18:56.160 --> 01:19:02.640
 is not just we play games that we are kind of like trying to be pretending that in the reality of

01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:11.840
 according by jana tiki truly we are in that status this is is like delusion of ours it's not really

01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:19.200
 really this is what we are now is not really according by jana tiki that divine mandala

01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:28.000
 is the real but why we are not seeing because our dual cataract cataracts of the duality

01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:36.720
 blood blood and then we are not seeing that it's blood blood or we diluted our self then we don't

01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:48.240
 see but reality level our nature of the mind or nature is so pure so pure is just a buddha status

01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:54.400
 and therefore our senses are also in a buddha sense status therefore all the object of the senses

01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:54.640
 are

01:19:54.640 --> 01:20:01.600
 also in that divine sense status so therefore what we what we call the realizing that what we

01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:02.240
 realize

01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:08.000
 and not we trying to pretend in something but we are really going back to the ordinary state

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:17.120
 exactly what we are and not letting obstructed by the dualities so that's that's and when we

01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:24.480
 did that and when you have that real thing then everything is in the divine everything is that

01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:30.560
 ordinary enlightened state so therefore i mean according that most of you know that buddha is

01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:36.880
 buddha who the enlightenment is not just you're trying to gain something that which you're not

01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:43.760
 now you're coming back to the ordinary state what you are ah so for that reason that buddha

01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:51.120
 enlightenment is natural it is true it is natural it is not artificial and you just

01:20:51.120 --> 01:21:00.400
