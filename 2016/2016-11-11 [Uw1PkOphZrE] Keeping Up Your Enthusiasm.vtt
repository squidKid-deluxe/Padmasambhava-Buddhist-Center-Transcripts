00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.840
 Perhaps fifty or a hundred prostrations, I get tired, my enthusiasm disappears, and I am wondering

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:19.530
 which is more important to remain, just do enough while I feel enthusiasm, or is it more important

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.000
 to build accumulations?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:30.960
 Generally, it is definitely, enthusiasm is very important, and that is really essential. Therefore,

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.000
 we have to reactivate our enthusiasm.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.490
 We should feel joy, we should feel appreciation, we should feel the importance of the pozzama, the

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:53.000
 prostration. The prostration is so important. It is really, in a normal level, in a regular level,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 the prostration is we are doing exercise.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:01.680
 Just body exercise, and exercise, and that means when we do the exercise, and what it does, it does

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:10.010
, we become athletics, truly we become, and also it is very shrinking to our unwanted, all those j

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.000
abbies.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.080
 No, it is really, I am not kidding, as long as our knees and the joints are correct, we are really

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:25.950
 making slim, slims, and that also means that we have to invite the coolness to ourselves, we become

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.000
 cool, cool guys.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.360
 So those are regular kind of like concepts. It is true, I am not just making jokes, I am making

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.610
 that. Truly it is, really that, it is really, and we are building the muscles, we are joining the

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:40.000
 object.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 And then in the spiritual level, we call it dharma level, it is really we are purifying all the

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 body obstacles, the teaching said, channel obstacles.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.680
 Body is best on the channels. We are purifying channels, cleansing, purifying in a straight, our

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:04.000
 channels has so many corkets, so many kind of like banded, all that in the teaching said that.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.890
 And also so many like corkets, all nuts and all these things. By doing all stations, it is really

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:18.550
 like we are purifying, prying and cleansing and the body obscurations, and that is what it really

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.000
 is the teaching said.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.330
 And then also those are just generally physical kind of things, but if we combine our motivation

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.000
 with that, join the applications, join the applications.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.730
 That means that our wind energy, flowing energy through the channels are really like joy and wisdom

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:51.680
, beautiful, that air and energy is moving through joyful energy and clean, calm, soothing, and that

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.000
 really like you are moving through all the channels.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.270
 And walk in the wisdom, wisdom more and more that, and then with that motivation, and then fill the

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:05.000
 presence of the Buddha or the refugee right in front of that.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:18.370
 And you will think also when we are doing the bodhstach and we are not just doing bodhstach

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.640
 according dharma level, we are following the footsteps of all those ancient great masters who did

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.000
 this, who followed this path and reached enlightenment, become the great masters.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.100
 This great master, not just the born with great master, with their joyful effort, the courage and

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:33.000
 commitment, their devotion, then result they become we call great masters.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.150
 So we are really following that great path of the great masters and following that path of great

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.000
 peace. So for that, it is really so wonderful, so spacious.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.560
 And then we also extended this motivation by this doing these bodhstachians, may all send a peace

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:57.560
 of cleanse and put it by their body obscurations, fill their all channels in those with great

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:03.000
 energy of wisdom, and they have the great realization of pure motivation of the mind.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.010
 And we think that, and we expanded that really whole thing is transformed, such beautiful,

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:15.000
 beautiful, beautiful things, beautiful that environment in enlightenment things.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.670
 And then what the Buddha's teaching said that, said, and also what the teaching said, when you do

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:23.000
 the bodhstachians, everything is a great thing.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.730
 You are doing the bodhstachians, along with all the beings of six awareness things. You are guiding

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:35.000
 with them, for example, all doing the bodhstachians, same way in every living beings.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.360
 So the ripple effect of your motivation is ignited throughout the universal world and going beyond

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.000
 that.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.540
 And it is really one of the bread and food for accumulation. And then in the teaching said, what

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:56.790
 the teaching said, said, the way you do the bodhstachians, bodhstachians, that, atoms of that sport

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:00.000
 has become the optimal venerations.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.680
 In the teaching said, because such beautiful motivation, beautiful intuition, beautiful meditation,

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.000
 you do the bodhstachians.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.160
 So the area in the teaching even said, that is really become the optimal venerations. That atoms,

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:21.740
 atoms of that area, and that atoms of the old man, that sport is, as much as that atoms, that might

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.000
 be accumulated merits in the teaching said.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.900
 So this is the one of the very powerful meditation with the combination of all these things, like

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:38.750
 also in the teaching said, for example, joint target is this folded hand, which is like lot of blo

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.000
oming mother, mother's forehand.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:51.150
 And you put this, by putting this folded hand, putting on the koranjaka, may all my body obsc

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:57.000
urations of the mind and all living beings clean.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:03.370
 And when you put this to the speech center, my speech obscurations and all the sending beings speak

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.000
 obscurations clean.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:15.620
 When you touch to this, this is to the heart center and may my mind obscurations and all mind obsc

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.000
urations and all the sending beings cleanse and put in pride with that.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:25.480
 And then when you touch the five point or the straight on that, may every living beings, five rims,

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:29.000
 in some times there will be six rims and five rims.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:35.910
 And five rims, this is when you touch to the five point on the ground, may all the five rims of the

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:40.000
 sending beings are completely out of the troubles.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.760
 May that happen. In the teaching, it is so, I mean, it is all, one way in the post section is

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:51.000
 combined entirely with the teachings of the Buddhas.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 And then also when you touch to this, all the koranjaka Buddhas are pleased.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.500
 When you touch to the speech, all the speak koranjaka Buddhas are, and when you touch to the heart

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:08.000
 center, all the heart koranjaka Buddhas, inner levels, all Buddhas are now glowing there.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:15.690
 And then when you touch to the, everything on the floor, five point, the entirely Buddhas, infinite

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:20.000
 Buddhas, peaceful, wrath Buddhas are glowing state.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:28.200
 So you glorify our inherent Buddha college. So therefore, post section is really so important and

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.000
 Hindu practice is so important.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:37.320
 As I said yesterday, as the Buddha Shakyamuni said, part truth, this is the part truth. We are

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:40.000
 following the part truth, one after another.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.800
 And part truth, when we follow, there is always kind of difficulty in the challenges, absolutely

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:51.000
 all those comes. This is normal. It's nothing unusual that we experience.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.300
 All those enlightened beings, all those great masters, when you read the life story of those, they

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:58.000
 really experience that too, I mean.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.700
 The teachings, their lives will see those things, definitely, all that can experience it. For that

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:12.000
 reason, what we need, courage and commitment, devotion and determinations and joyful effort.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 And that's it. This is truly, it is nothing as any kind of negative condensation this practice has.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:28.130
 It's all peace, it's all will of love, commitment and devotion. It's nothing else. It's revealing

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:30.000
 our goodness college.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 Why we need to be kind of skeptical, doubt and hesitate. It's revealing our goodness. Beautiful.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:47.530
 We're removing our emotions, negative behaviors, arrogance. And then exposition is the most

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:50.000
 powerful of the antidote of arrogance, arrogance.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:56.660
 Arrogance is a combination of the ego and ignorance. And I tried to do all that. We are knocking

00:08:56.660 --> 00:09:00.000
 down the head of the ego clings.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:07.690
 So therefore, it is really one of the very beautiful and for that reason, all of us like to

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:15.000
 activate a beautiful joy and appreciation is really very, very special.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 Thank you very much.
