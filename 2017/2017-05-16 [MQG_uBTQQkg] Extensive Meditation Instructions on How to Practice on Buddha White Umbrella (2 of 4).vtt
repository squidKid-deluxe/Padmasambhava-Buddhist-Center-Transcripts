00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
 "In open we quote, many times we quote, oh now we are going to meditate. Loosely this

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.920
 visualization is not meditation. But visualization is the most important meditation. It is a

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:19.120
 skill who means meditate combined with the wordslessness. This is very animal meditation.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:27.560
 It is not just that we are meditating only one aspect of the nature. Nature of the mind

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:39.480
 is full of wonders, not just only open emptiness states. This Vedayana visualization is open

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.920
 emptiness and wondrous calling both all together. And then we are now embracing that nature

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:58.680
 without any disconnected or without any kind of leftover. And therefore it is so special.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.560
 To begin these practices, then I think many of you heard and you said so many times, you

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.800
 said so many times, this meditate has different styles. And according to my teachings, open

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.480
 group and my symbols, which repeatedly emphasize with the three samadhis, and those are known

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:25.640
 as the satinist samadhi and then manifestation samadhi, sit samadhis. And those are more kind

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:32.600
 of graduation ways, one after another. First is satinist samadhi, meditating on the great

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:39.640
 emptiness. Then manifest satin samadhi, arising energy of the compassion, meditating mainly on

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:46.840
 compassion level, without any divisions or the discrimination. Pervasive compassion though.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:53.560
 To all beings, as like building sunlight, heat in the sky in the morning time, free from the

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:01.480
 cloud and the dust. Just that compassion. Brilliant spread out that to all the same beings.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:07.000
 And then union of the compassion in the great openness, emptiness or wisdom, then see the

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.080
 syllabus comes, instant. Those are the graduation ways, one after another. And then those are also

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:19.720
 known as a more kind of Mahayoga meditation and Anayoga system of the building of the meditations.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:27.240
 And the Dzogki teaching often says, instant to reconnect with meditation. This is Dzogki style

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.360
 of the meditate. There's not really many stages, even though here, for example, in that way,

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:39.080
 it says, in the way, personally, every kind of follows graduate ways. First, we join the 'I'.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:48.840
 'I' is the connecting to the open state of the nature of the mind beyond the dualities.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:03:02.040
 So 'I' is key. And 'I' is the symbol to touching our self or to connect our self to the whole

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:10.040
 inner nature, free from the dualities. The moment we joined 'I', that moment we are in the nature

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:18.600
 status. The moment we joined 'I', that moment we are on the, in the way, cruise levels. We reach

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:24.280
 already cruise levels. The moment we joined 'I', that moment you're in that state, cruise levels.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:30.600
 And now, relax. There's no need for more effort, anything. You're already on the cruise level.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:38.760
 You're already on the state of the deep 'I'. How that 'I', that state is, that is the great master

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:47.720
 city. The all phenomena are empty, inexpressible beyond the consumption. That is this cruise level

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:56.600
 is. That is the nature. This is our inner cruise level. We reach that status, deep open state.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:03.960
 The moment we joined 'I', that moment. You are there. And this is the absolute state of the mother,

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:14.280
 white umbrella. My white umbrella. This is the absolute Mother. This is the Pandya Para Mother.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:21.160
 This is the Samana Buddha. This is the Dharmakaya status. And this right, this moment, we are there

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:21.400
.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:28.440
 You see in the, in the Dantara, or the Madhyana Tithi, Dharmakaya is not just waiting for to come.

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:34.360
 Dharmakaya is right here. It asks you to teach, teach you, or the Buddha asks you to ask,

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.880
 and point it out. We are right here. Here, we are in these orchestrates. We are from the beginning,

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.880
 Dharmakaya status. And that's it. So, if you have time, for example,

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:51.480
 time, and back to the short time, per second, really, kind of feel that power, feel that nature

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:59.160
 beyond the duality, analyzations, thinking, just relax in the present status, without any thoughts.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:06.680
 And bring the brilliant 'I' kind of like that clarity in the mind, without any division,

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:15.640
 without any ideas. In that moment, what happened? Then, here, by own syllable, an umbrella does,

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:27.400
 umbrella does figure, or does what? And there is the own syllable, some syllable.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:33.720
 This is of course, the teaching has to be one after another here. But with this teaching here,

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:41.000
 as in the third one, I said, the moment I collect it into a primordial, inseparable wisdom,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:48.680
 and a samayvi, that moment, we ever, I'm now completely in a very wide umbrella status.

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:55.400
 State, of course, teaching have to say one after another to introducing, I should have asked that

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:02.920
 status, that. Otherwise, it is called instant recollected meditation. As teaching opens,

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:09.640
 sometimes you use example, as fish jumping out of the water. Fish jumped out of the water,

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:15.880
 and that moment, fish is already formed, is not something fish gradually formed when it's jumped.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:21.080
 Instantly, when we recollected that, we kind of, out of the midst of the duality,

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:33.480
 later, when that duality disappeared or disappeared, removed, at that moment, we are already

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:39.480
 in a wide umbrella status. The moment I recollect, that moment, or the moment I think, that moment,

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:45.400
 you're completely in a wide umbrella status, or we are completely in a wide umbrella status.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:51.800
 So, therefore, again, to begin with this, again, to this, the moment you say the "ah", at that

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:52.360
 moment,

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:59.160
 a period of the "om" syllable, a wide "om" syllable, with full power, blazing power,

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:05.320
 and then with a wide umbrella, as the rainbow body, that all happened. And that all instantly

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:11.720
 performed the different activities, as yesterday we went. The white light to the pure land,

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:18.360
 and the light going to all the beams, those all did simultaneously, one time, one time,

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:24.360
 and that moment you become white umbrella. You are in the old, in the state of the white umbrella

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:24.760
 status.

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:34.440
 This, this figure, this is so fast, so instant, there is not really time to kind of count. And

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:39.160
 we use the examples of the great masters in the Buddha's teaching. You say, for example, there is

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:47.000
 like 60 lotus patterns, or 64 lotus patterns, and start out one after another, another, another,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:54.040
 and you put the sharp needle, push down, it just, moment to you, but this moment, it went down,

00:07:54.040 --> 00:08:01.720
 and it's going all the down, and where it went, it pushed the one after another, those 64 patterns,

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:13.880
 one after another. So this is, is, this divided into 64 parts. But in that one part, one part,

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:20.200
 we are in that, all this activity happened in that one part, we are in the state of the white

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:20.680
 umbrella.

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:28.520
 That is known as the instant recollecting, zogchen, meditation, art style of the

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:33.720
 virtualization, as fish jumping out of the water, they appeared everything, completely.

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:42.200
 And then when she appeared, oh, now we are in that status, in that status, how she is,

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:48.200
 then in the teaching set here, already is, Vedic Chrome, she is known as Vedic Chrome,

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:56.120
 and the great reversal, reversal, reversal. And that means the all negativity,

00:08:56.120 --> 00:09:02.920
 obscuration, reversal. It's not just something kind of dropping that negative, somewhere else.

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:09.400
 It is reversing instantly in the dharma-dhatu, great emptiness states. Even there's no trace.

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:15.560
 That is the reverse. It's not just taking from somewhere and reversing that somewhere else,

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:22.360
 or leaving that somewhere else. And that is what is. And then she is Bhagavati,

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:33.640
 Bhagavati. And this is in Tibet, Jungni-dhema. Jungni-dhema is Bhagavan, is for the Buddha,

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:40.920
 for the male, and Bhagavati is for the females, so she is a female Buddha, and Bhagavati,

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:47.960
 the mother. And that is also, I mean, it has many different meanings in, for example,

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:54.200
 Jung, in Tibet, this Bhagavati is translated into from Sanskrit by those great monsters

00:09:54.200 --> 00:10:01.240
 as I said yesterday, Choro, Yamsi, Kava, Parsa, Veratana, and Hanyeshi, they translate,

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:09.720
 this Bhagavati is translated into Tibet, Jung-dhema. And this has three meanings. So, I mean,

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:16.440
 Jung means destroyed all the four negative demons, four demons. Then is the position,

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:23.080
 position, who has all the goodness qualities of the, of the, there's six different qualities,

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:29.480
 and they means beyond in Tibet, means beyond the samsara and the nirvana. So that means fully

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:36.280
 enlightened beings, who possess all the enlightened qualities, remove all the obscuring obstacle,

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:43.960
 she is perfectly, totally embodiment of all enlightened beings. And then her name is then

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:52.600
 white umbrella or dog carpamum. And this time she has then the five, one thousand, the past,

00:10:52.600 --> 00:11:01.720
 as, as is said, and so one thousand and two hundred in this side, the front side, as we have

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:09.240
 this illustration you see here. So see, and two hundred straight up this side, and which is in

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.040
 white,

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:19.320
 and two hundred in the left side is a yellow face, and then back side two hundred is a red,

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:26.120
 and then left side two hundred is in the green, and the upper there is two hundred,

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:40.440
 that is then is, is in blue colors, blue colors. And this, yes, this post is generally what and,

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:55.480
 and generally he is, and there is vrata-buddha, and peaceful Buddha, and semi-vrata-buddhas,

00:11:55.480 --> 00:12:05.000
 and he is as semi-vrata-ful or vrata-buddhas. Vrata-buddha has nine colors,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:13.480
 alternate set, I mean that is principle connected, principle connected, nine, nine colors,

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:20.440
 three colors to the body, three colors to the speech, and three colors to the verse to mind.

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:29.240
 Nine, three are, and in a debate called gupa, I'm just, maybe you write it, gupa, power,

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:45.100
 Next row. Get back. G-E-G-P-A. P-A. Group up. And the power. Power. P-A. W-A. Power. Next row. G-I-

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:57.860
J. G-I-G-S-U-R-U-N-D. Next row. Those are three qualities of the body.

00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:13.350
 And then. Go here. Now. Go here. And three qualities of the speech. Go-pa. Go-pa. G-G-O-P-A. Go-pa.

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:18.100
 Go-hi. Go-hi, taksho.

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:35.720
 And she. S-H-E. She. Go-pa. He-wa. S-H-E-W-A. He-wa. And then taksho. D-R-A-G-S-U-L. Taksho. Taksho

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:36.100
.

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:43.600
 And then. Then. Those are three qualities of the speech. And then. Three qualities of the mind. And

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:56.100
 those are known as tingi. Tingi. N-Y-I-N-G-A. Tingi. Tingi. Namba. She-wa.

00:13:56.100 --> 00:14:12.200
 And namba. N-G-A-M-P-A. Namba. And then she-wa. S-H-E-W-A. Namba. She-wa. She-wa. And what it means

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:14.100
 now? Go-pa.

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:20.400
 Go-pa means, of course, rata-buddha. When we talk, kind of, think of rata-buddha, it looks very f

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:30.100
ussy. But also, same time, time, go-pa means very attractive. Very passionate, I think, go-pa.

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:42.850
 Very attractive, very, very attractive, very passionate, or very, I think, western, very like macho

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:47.100
. Macho style. It's very beautiful. Very, very beautiful.

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:58.970
 So, go-pa. And power is very courageous. Courageous or very, very, very powerful looking. Powerful

00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:02.100
 looking. Powerful looking, powerful looking.

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:12.010
 And very beautiful proportions, perfect proportions, and perfect. Perfect and beautiful. And sexual

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:18.100
 is very dominating. Very dominating and very frightening.

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:26.900
 It's very majestic, very majestic, right? You cannot, kind of, like, kidding, kidding, or cheating,

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:29.100
 cheating. It's very powerful.

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:39.100
 Those are roughly three beautiful symbols of the body. So it is attractive, it is powerful looking,

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:45.100
 and it is very dominating and very...

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:49.100
 Your Majesty and Firstful. Firstful.
