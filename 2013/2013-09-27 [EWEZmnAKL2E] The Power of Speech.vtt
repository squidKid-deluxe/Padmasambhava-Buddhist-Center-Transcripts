In this video, Khenpo Rinpoche teaches about three types of speech: (1) honey speech, (2) flower speech, and (3) dirty speech, and how important it is to always try to speak with \"honey-like\" speech.",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.360
 The next one is again about the patience, and the patience one is to help the patient to get upset.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:29.080
 To get angry. The number one tool to make proper upset or myself upset is the language that we use.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:35.560
 And power can read our mind, or your mind, or the other's mind.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:44.840
 Power can hear your words. Power can see you, or see us, and can hear us.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:53.070
 And then this language is so powerful. External things may be, of course, powerful, but this

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.080
 language and speech is so powerful.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:04.680
 It goes deep down, deep down. In the teaching you say that this language, the speech, the world

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.760
 goes deeper than the bone in the body.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:14.120
 In the bone of our flesh, or the bone, it really goes there. It goes deep down the heart.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:21.280
 Every kind of heart-speech, every time you make that speech, it almost purses the individual's

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.280
 heart. Heart, it gets up, so goes deep, and then get angry.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:35.540
 Then get angry to differentiate, to protect that. Because that feeling that is so strong, then

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.080
 immediately we react, react, and then get angry.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:48.190
 The reaction is anger. The reaction is anger. So therefore, we have to be always thoughtful of our

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.560
 speech when we speak.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:57.810
 Speak is powerful for that reason in the Buddha teaching. Among the eight novel parts, one of the

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.280
 novel parts is not perfect speech.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:10.210
 Speech is so important. Speech is calming, peaceful, respectful, and appreciate. If you use that

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.640
 word, it makes people happy.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.290
 And you also make happy. When people are happy, you feel happy to do it. It's not something that

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.800
 you make only others happy, and yourself instead.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:29.620
 You make happy others, and you make that happy to you. Whatever we do, it reflects back into it as

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.440
 a matter of emptiness, that is.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:41.640
 Therefore, speech is so important. Soap-speaking, nice-speaking, respect and appreciation, kind and

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.440
 compassion-speech, and then, after all, this is practice.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.250
 This is dharma. That is dharma. Dharma is not something that you have to do strange, different

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.920
 things.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:59.240
 Dharma, we mingle with our activities. Our activities of the physical, our activities of the world,

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:04.800
 speech, verbal, our way of thinking, that is dharma.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:11.030
 Dharma, that means we make it so beautiful, ourself. Beautiful in, beautiful out, beautiful,

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.320
 beautiful. Beautiful. It's so beautiful. That is dharma.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:22.050
 And that means also we are accumulating a lot of merit, good energies, accumulation of merit,

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:28.260
 beautiful things, really beautiful things, and helping to others, and then we are practicing both

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.440
 each other.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:36.690
 And that is the morality. This is what we discussed before. It's morality, keeping respect and help

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:44.440
, and so to speak, and also, oh, it's good, moral. Good, humble. Good, moral. It's so good.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:51.680
 And with that understanding, here, Buddha said, "Pobha can say it in three different ways." Again,

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:58.600
 Buddha said, "Buddha said there is three different ways to our speech."

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:08.810
 First is honey-like speech. Second is flower-like speech. And third is the dirty-like speech, or

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.640
 dirty speech, dirty speech.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:19.870
 Among that, among these three things, we should always try to speak as honey-like. Even here Buddha

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:29.830
 said, not mentioned in the flower-like, flower-like, good to you, but always try to speak honey-

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.640
like speech.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:41.430
 And that, when we speak that, what does that mean? It always comes down to be beautiful in heart,

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:48.640
 just the same in heart, not with heart. Heart becomes so mellow, mellow.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:57.280
 And then, also, this is true. It is true. And then, this is so, therefore, dirty-like, like this,

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.640
 again, I think, identical to the beginning of this.

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:08.920
 So, Buddha said, "There is three speeches." One comes, sings to the heart, and that is true. And

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.640
 then, wearing the strings from the throat.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:22.700
 These three are, as examples of the honey, flowers, and the dirty, or the, yeah, like garbage, the

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:33.640
 smelly garbage. These three, among that three, try to always speak with the honey-like.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:44.490
 Honey-like speeches. And among that, he again, one says, trying to give up the third one, third

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.640
 speech. That is dirty-like.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:56.060
 So, the flow-like is fine. Honey-like is the best, but the flow-like is fine, but give up the dirty

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.640
-like, good-like speech.

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:12.390
 So, that is the really about this world's teachings, where we speak. That is, because speech is so

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:16.640
 important, it becomes the cause of anger.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:25.440
 Speech becomes the cause of anger, therefore, and then it is good to remove that, so that our

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:32.640
 patients continually remain strong and beautiful, not disturbing anyone's state.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:38.640
 So, that is this statement, or these teachings.
