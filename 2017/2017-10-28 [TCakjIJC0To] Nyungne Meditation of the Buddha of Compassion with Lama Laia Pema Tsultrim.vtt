It came to Tibet around the 12th century, and the practice continues to flourish today. It is a profound and powerful practice of silence, fasting and purification.\n\nThe Nyungne retreat is a Tibetan Buddhist meditation practice based on the Buddha of Compassion known as the Thousand-Armed Chenrezig. It\u2019s designed to purify negative karma and accumulate merit and wisdom by continuously mingling the mind with compassion, the speech with mantra, and the body with perfect morality. In this way, we will begin to purify and heal ourselves and others.\n\nLama Laia Pema Tsultrim was ordained in 2003 as a monk by his teachers Ven. Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche and Ven. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche at the sacred site of the Buddha\u2019s first teaching in Deer Park, India. He is a resident Dharma teacher at Padma Samye Ling (PSL) Monastery in New York, where he has lived since 1999 (padmasambhava. org).\n\nLama Laia is a senior editor of Dharma Samudra Publishing, leads daily meditations at PSL, and regularly helps with the Padmasambhava Buddhist Center (PBC) monastery and nunnery in India.\n\nHis younger days were engaged in traveling the world, training in the arts, and exploring expressions and paths of spirituality and world peace. This lead Lama Laia to take refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha under the close guidance of the Venerable Khenpo Rinpoches, abbots who mastered the ancient living lineage of the Nyingma school of Tibetan Buddhism. With their blessings, Lama Laia continues to deepen his training in the \u201cthree wisdoms\u201d of study, contemplation, and meditation.\n\nLama Laia\u2019s unique style of communicating the essential pillars of Buddhist tenets enables him to impart tranquility and joy, while encouraging great enthusiasm and inspiration in others to develop mindfulness, compassion, and wisdom.\n\nwww.padmasambhava.org",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.640
 Welcome. This is our twenty, maybe twenty-third Nyungne practice we've had here in glorious pure

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.000
 land of Padma Samye Ling,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 led for many years by our very precious teachers, Venerable Kenshin Pauld and Shera Rinpoche,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:28.330
 and Venerable Kenpoche Von Dondyo Rinpoche, who established this beautiful oasis for everyone to

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:29.000
 come,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 explore their nature, and the Buddha's teachings, and Guru Padma Sambha's teachings,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 and just make this beautiful living lineage of wisdom and compassion available for all the beings

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 of this time

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 and long into the future is our aspiration. So, again, just so precious and special to be here.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.560
 I know maybe several people have been here every one of those years and beyond and others different

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:04.000
 degrees

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 or had done the Nyungne practice before, but welcome wherever we are with our practice.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:25.360
 We're all here in the spirit of love, peace, compassion, joy, appreciation, courage, and commitment

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.000
.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 And like our Venerable teachers always say, really, everything is circumstantial.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 It's our motivation and our intention that makes all the difference.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.650
 So, just as we begin, again, just reminding each one of us, reflecting on how beautiful and

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.000
 precious this time is,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:03.480
 that of all the situations just in this world that are going on, that we are free to be here

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.000
 together,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 again, with this beautiful profound teaching, which like Raga Asya, the great Karma Chakme said,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 "Just practicing the Nyungne practice once closes the door on all lower rebirths."

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 And Buddha Shakyamuni, Guru Padma Sambha, so many teachings on how powerful and profound

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 contemplating,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 you know, Chenrezig and reciting Om Mani Padme Home is just a very special, rare time.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 So again, just like we always do, beginning, really connecting with our beautiful motivation

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 and reflecting on our beautiful situation, that we're not only just within this world,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 but all within all of the myriad, some trouble, some situations and traps of some sorrow.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 We're free of so much. And we have these beautiful facilities.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 We have this beautiful Dharma that is here and alive and living with our great teachers

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 and the Sangha coming together to explore and embody them.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 It's really so special, so precious. And we shouldn't forget that.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 Like when Kenpo Sambha Rinpoche says again and again,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 this connecting with our joy, our appreciation, looking at our situation as it is,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 that's the whole Buddhist path. That's why always connecting with our intention,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 our motivation is so critical, so vital, so important.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 So when just reflecting on, again, how precious the situation is for us,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 all of our freedoms and endowments that allow us to be here.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 And then, again, within the great display, you know, that's just ceaselessly ceasing.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 We all have reflected to some degree upon impermanence.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 You know, this beautiful opportunity, we're all here together,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 but the sun in two more sunrises will depart to other lands and worlds,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 but all in the same spirit. But again, this weekend is just here for a couple days,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 a very strong practice, a beautiful practice.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 And again, just reflecting again for all of us on these four thoughts, impermanence.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 And then, the laws of cause and effect, of karma.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 Again, what has brought us here is, like Rinpoche says so much, it's not co-accidental.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 We all have a beautiful connection with the true nature

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 that's very clear and resounding and putting us all together in this life.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 And in this moment, in this beautiful place, perfect place, perfect time,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 perfect teachings and practice, perfect assembly,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 perfect, beautiful, vast view, meditation and conduct we'll be engaging with.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 And so, you know, inevitably, the benefits of this practice are just going to be huge.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 Maybe we'll just see the tip of the mountain, the tip of the iceberg,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 but we can go move with confidence, you know, again with our pure motivation

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 and our actions of body, speech and mind we'll be doing, you know.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 And just reflecting again on karma, there's suffering in the world, you know.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.000
 There's all the six realms of samsara, so as much as we're connecting with the beautiful view,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 also keeping our eyes open to all the situations of samsara, all the sufferings, you know,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 with wide-eyed, open, tender hearts, and also keeping the great view

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 of the openness and the purity of all phenomena.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 Like they say in the beginning of the 37 practices of the bodhisattvas.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 Togme Rinpoche is saying, you know, although you see all phenomena exactly as they are,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 which means empty and vast, open, free, pure from the beginning,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 still you, Chenrezic, look on all beings with the eyes and compassion.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 So we're fusing again, we're doing this great practice of wisdom and compassion together.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 We're generating, purifying our own, increasing our own wisdom,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 doing all these meritorious actions, generating on that,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 bringing all these beautiful conditions together for our practice.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
 And again, connecting with our bodhicitta just as vastly as we can.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 This is fundamentally vast bodhicitta practice.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 So again, just as much as we kind of reflect on the four thoughts in the beginning,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 during, after, again connecting with the motivation of our bodhicitta,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 and the ultimate level of bodhicitta is our beautiful innate nature

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 and the nature of every single living being, the Buddha nature,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.000
 which is nothing but limitless wisdom, love, compassion.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 It's just the degree to which we recognize that.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 That's the only difference between ordinary sentient being

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 and fully enlightened Buddha is the degree to which we recognize that beautiful nature or not.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 But we all experience love, we all experience compassion,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 we all have wisdom and intelligence to some degree.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 So again, we're starting right where we are and we're opening,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 opening beyond into the great vast beautiful nature,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 connecting with our bodhicitta.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 That's the absolute bodhicitta on the relative level.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
 We're really thinking of all the beings of samsara.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 We're remembering the four boundless now and throughout our practice,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 just really opening our mind and heart inseparably without any discrimination

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 as far and wide as we can to every single living being

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 with loving hearts and loving minds to the best of our ability,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 wishing everyone have happiness and the causes of happiness

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 and be free of suffering and the causes of suffering.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 That's compassion and rejoice that all beings have the ultimate fulfillment,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 knowing the true nature which is not even the word suffering is there.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 It's a great bliss, great happiness, knowing the true nature

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 as well as all fulfillments that we can go to in the more ordinary level.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 That's our boundless joy.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 And again, thinking not ignoring those close to us,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
 whether it's loving relationship, neutral relationship,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 troubling, challenging relationship,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 keeping every single being we know directly that's in our lives and through them,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 letting that just be the door to open and open and break down

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 like the cheek in the mountain of our regimented, fixed conceptions

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:52.000
 to open our heart, again, with wisdom and compassion and love.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:58.000
 And so we'll do that with this beautiful practice of the new nyang,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
 which again
