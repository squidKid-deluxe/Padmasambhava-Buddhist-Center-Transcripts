00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.680
 I already said that, and those of us sincerely want to practice that which is seven spatials

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:26.480
 from the two practices. The fourth one is not too much attached to these worldly things.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.920
 And that is generally in the Buddha's teaching, and generally when we talk in the Day of Man,

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:40.160
 the Buddha's greatest teachers, Paul Noble Truth teaches. Paul Noble Truth teaches to

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:50.880
 are what? To are suffering truth and a cause of suffering truth. This samsara is what we

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:59.840
 call samsara. It is suffering, it has suffering truth, it has cause of suffering truth, it has.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:08.000
 Even though it is all that kind of suffering, which is suffering truth and cause of suffering truth

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.000
,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.560
 but also it has a lot of good things we can learn, we can develop from this.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:23.200
 The fourth one is what? In the teaching samsara. You should bring up everything what you do,

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:30.240
 you bring up the knowledge, you bring up the knowledge of samsara. Samsara is generally

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.160
 speaking, as I said, greatest teachers say, suffering truth and cause of suffering truth.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:42.080
 What is the cause of suffering truth? The cause of suffering truth is

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:52.960
 emotion and it is activities. Or many times we say negativity, it is activities. Those are

00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:00.960
 cause of suffering truth. Those also we can talk later to you, but that is what suffering truth is.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:11.200
 The result of suffering truth is samsara. Samsara is what? All the six rams is samsara.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:20.000
 Among the six rams, what we see now? We see human rams, that which we are human rams.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:29.520
 Then we see some part of the animal rams. Rest, four or four and five rams are,

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.840
 we don't see, we don't see. But according to the greatest teacher,

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:43.440
 the buddha kyamuni is existing. Hell ram is existing. Hungry ghost ram is existing.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:51.360
 And animal ram is existing. We see half of that. Half or just we see some part. Maybe we not have,

00:02:51.360 --> 00:03:00.960
 we see part of that. And then we don't see the asura ram. We don't see the god's rams, god's ram.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:06.240
 But whether we see or not, they all are known as samsaras.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:13.440
 Samsara is also known as a quote, quote, no but with the terminology, it is suffering truth.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:19.760
 It has sufferance. It is the result of the cause,

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:30.240
 cause of suffering truth, cause of suffering truth. Therefore, result causes suffering truth,

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:37.120
 therefore, result what is to be loved. It has also suffering or uncomfortable,

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:44.960
 challenging, difficulties, hardships. It's not smooth, easy going always. It's going.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.400
 And those are known as what? In the buddha teachings,

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:59.920
 teachings, but however, all this suffering, among them we are human beings. We are all human beings

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.920
.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:05.920
 Also, we look to human beings. There's a variety of the human beings. Of course, we can divide

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:12.160
 into different countries. But even in one country, there's a variety of human beings

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:20.080
 that are going through their karmic beliefs. All are going through karmic beliefs. Even we are,

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:27.120
 for example, this country is one of the great countries on this planet. Even this country has

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:33.360
 varieties of the purpose. And we look, I mean, we know that. It's not something that you have to do

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.360
.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:44.080
 Some are very, very fancy and happy and joy and luckless. And some are so powerless.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:51.200
 Even worse than maybe third countries. Some are impoverished. Some are constantly fierce,

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:59.200
 fierce, scared, and tortured. All that what buddha said, the greatest teacher buddha said,

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:05.440
 six raim, what they're experiencing, that all things are happening to the human beings.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:14.000
 Even these human beings, all that, even this great country, experience something like that. Many

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.080
 are

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:20.640
 talking about this, this. And then animal beings, if you think, how many difficult troubles they're

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:28.800
 going through. Really, sound up and taking advantages and using each other's. And there is

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:37.680
 no way to respect and appreciate two animals most of the chance. Except maybe bad, bad dogs or bad,

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:47.440
 bad, bad cats. Cats. Mostly, this has no any values. That's how the human mentality is just used

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:53.440
 according to the way they like to use. In a way, all that I'm not going to bring, all that you,

00:05:53.440 --> 00:06:02.100
 we all know. Torture, all that put their joys, put their happiness, put one's own happiness. Really

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.640
,

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:08.640
 according to the teaching, those are really hell realm experience. All hell realm are saying, oh,

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:12.800
 many times we probably say, oh, I don't believe that. You don't have to believe or not.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:19.280
 Just read what human beings are doing to the animal realms, those who are going to use it.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:26.480
 It is exactly saying what Buddha told in the hell realm. They're really going through that.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:35.840
 This is what all, it's this realm we can experience. To look into that, to look to us,

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:44.800
 what the difference for us. Really, what the difference. We are to compare with that, to look

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:54.790
 up, we are in heavens, not just in the samsara. Really, so, so brilliant, so competent, so original

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:55.040
,

00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:01.040
 so good. This is also according to the Buddha teaching, it's not just for accident.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:10.400
 It's not just for accident. It is our privilege, good activities. That's something that we

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:19.840
 enjoy the result. Enjoy that, call it. What we need, what we lead to as being practitioners,

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:27.200
 see that, see that, discover that from nicely and have the courage and commitment,

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:36.560
 determine to use this beautiful opportunity make even more bright. One's own future as well as

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:44.480
 the future of other beings. That is known as the symbol of practitioners. Doing that with

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:52.240
 better good, with good. Take this advice, not just kind of throw away and neglect it and waste it

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:52.400
 and

00:07:53.360 --> 00:08:01.040
 naively waste it. Take this advice, this. For that reason, what the gracious teacher said,

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:08.240
 among the poor renour, says the poor. The freedom and the favorable condition of the human birth

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:15.440
 is extremely difficult to obtain. Even though it is extremely to obtain, to obtain this,

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:24.490
 we often, we are that. We have that. Therefore, joy and appreciation. Again, this joy and

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:25.280
 appreciation

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:30.160
 reflected this, what we call it, is according to Buddha's teaching, it's not just when you're

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:37.680
 out of the dharma. That is a very foundational central column of the Buddha dharma. You really

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:43.040
 bring up that beautiful quality. It is practices. You're touching to the heart, to touching to the

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:51.360
 ground, not just looking the sky and hovering all the time. Jump to the earth, grounded, grounded.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:56.640
 Joy and appreciation. For those thoughts, we reflected that what in the gracious teacher,

00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:03.840
 in the practice leading, always said. Think of the freedom. Think of the freedoms. That's what we

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:04.080
 have.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:14.640
 And the second thing of the luxuries, luxuries we have. And all targeting 18 qualities of the

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:26.000
 human beings, or precious human beings. At freedom, 10 luxuries. We all have that in this room of

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:34.160
 the state. We all have, not every human being, or every human being has that. But we have that.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:34.480
 Maybe

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:42.390
 all human beings, not all human beings, maybe have that at freedoms, but not 10 luxuries. Not every

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:42.400
,

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:48.480
 but we have 10 luxuries. I'm not going to go list of those things, you know.

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:58.640
 Plus, we have luxuries of this world. Not just only 10, the luxuries there. Plus, we have luxuries

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:08.720
 of samsara. Beautiful luxuries of samsara. Therefore, enjoy. Enjoy. Enjoy and enjoy in

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:15.920
 appreciation. With humble enjoy, respect, and feel have some really good courage and commitment.

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:21.520
 Something that I'm going to use this, something beautiful purpose, this opportunity. By the

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:27.360
 blessings of the Buddha, Dhana, Sangha, and Guru Deva and Dakini, all lineage must bless me that I

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:33.920
 can do something, this beautiful opportunity. Beautiful this life. Like meaningful to me,

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:38.240
 and talk of all the living beings. Mangle that situation with both each other.

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:44.880
 That is known as the practices. And they didn't practice the lineage, what is it?

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:56.960
 Think of the freedom. Think of the luxuries. Think of how difficult to obtain these precious

00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:03.200
 human beings or human luxuries. That is in Buddha's teaching. Buddha told in the teaching,

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:13.760
 say, a yoke, yoke, floating in the ocean. One yoke that has gold. Yoke, the fluid in the oceans.

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:22.800
 Every hundred years, blind, totals come up in the ocean once in a while. Every hundred years,

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:31.040
 totals come up. And then that yoke is also floating by the wind, back and forth in different

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:40.480
 directions. And that wind totals come up, that head of the totals can go in the whole of the yoke.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:49.120
 That is actually more easy than to obtain the human body or precious human body.

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:58.560
 And that's what religion can say. And that also I don't have now go over that. But even scientists

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:05.280
 examine that. And they say, we got a really article. One stone we put on the bullet board,

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:14.880
 it's really true. It's so damn. It's just amazing how we got this precious life. There's so many

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:23.120
 difficulties that so hard, but yet we go on. So think of how difficult to obtain this. That's

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:31.840
 something we got. How fortunate. How beautiful it is. Recognizing, acknowledging, recognizing

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:38.640
 recognizing of the goodness as good is good dharma. And acknowledging and recognizing of the bad

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:39.040
 things

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:46.000
 as bad is also according to Buddhism, is dharma. You're using your intelligence, not ignoring,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.520
 not just a kind of skeptical way. Then we won't grow. We won't develop. We won't become perfect.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:56.400
 We will have to make perfect. To make perfect, we have to acknowledge,

00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:03.600
 enjoy, appreciate, have something not good. Trying to also recognize that. Trying to

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:08.560
 come and reduce that. Trying to help the courage of the commitment won't do the repeat again.

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:18.080
 Those are known as practitioners. Practitioners. So in the next one, what the grace master says

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:26.000
 of the human being. And also, to compare it. To compare it, generally, human beings

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:33.680
 and animals, among such animals, if we compare it to each other, human beings are so small,

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:44.720
 so small number than that compared with animal beings. Animal beings is to look at animals,

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:51.600
 even in one in ocean, how many animals there. Then to compare it of the all human beings,

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:59.760
 the population is growing, many billions. But animals, even among ocean could have

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:10.640
 trillions, not just billions. And then in earth, on the earth, or even 180, how many big animals.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:18.160
 To compare with that to these two human beings, generally human beings, in the teaching set,

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:25.360
 what the teaching set. All the animal rams, compare all the six rams, among six rams and

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:31.920
 human rams, each of those rams, is like dust of the earth. To compare with that, with human rams,

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:40.000
 is dust on these, these, on the nails. Nails. Numbers of ours. I mean, all these things.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.280
 And we have such this precious thing, so therefore, really enjoy this. It's so,

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:52.640
 so important. And that is what therefore should not too, too kind of enjoy. And with that

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:58.560
 understanding, and then also have the great courage and commitment determined to use these

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:04.880
 opportunities. Opportunities, not too much, grasping, clinging. Even it is so beautiful.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:12.000
 Even it is so spiritual, beautiful, it's not going to stay forever. That we know. I mean,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:19.120
 teaching set. Again, one great master, one of the great masters of Buddhism, known as Jersi

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:26.080
 Mastur Tomi, in his teaching, and one of what's called very known, very famous, 37 practices of

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:35.070
 the Bodhisattvas. What is that teaching set? Set. Set. Everything is best in parliament, in

00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:36.080
 parliament.

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:44.240
 All our friends and families, even though we want to stay together forever, it's not going to

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:44.560
 happen.

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:52.400
 One day, there is separation. And even we like to keep all our wealth in the belongings,

00:15:53.360 --> 00:16:00.160
 belongings. And with making such a big hard, difficult hardships, and postural you get,

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:06.480
 and then trying to maintain, then trying to increase, all that, that hardship, we got that,

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:17.760
 that also not going to last forever. It will go away one day. And not just only that, even our

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:26.080
 between, relation between our mind and Bodhis going to have separations. He said what? He said,

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:35.600
 the guest, the consciousness guest will depart, depart from the house of the Bodhi.

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:45.680
 Bodhi. So therefore, not too much grasping, not too much clinging. If we have not less grasping,

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:53.520
 less clinging, more practical, use this opportunity that is known as the practice

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:59.760
 of the Bodhisattvas. That's what teaching set. So therefore, not too much grasping,

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:03.840
 not too much clinging. Then next one is.
