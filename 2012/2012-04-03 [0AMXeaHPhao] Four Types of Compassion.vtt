00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.520
 The great master also Chandrakriti. When he wrote this famous book, as again Kenji Paticheran,

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.960
 which has quotations, often, often that.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.080
 He is the Chandrakriti. He was one of the great masters in the Buddhist historians.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:21.090
 He didn't praise to the Buddha, to the Bodhisattva, to the Ahathas, to anyone, he praised the

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.720
 compassion at the beginning of his famous book,

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:35.560
 Mademaka, Avatar, or woman, Jugamalai. He said, "All this, this Buddha can prevail. It comes from

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.400
 Buddha, compassion. Where Bodhisattva comes from?

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:49.290
 It comes from compassion. Where are others come from? It's compassion. And then compassion without

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.200
 any discrimination, division.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:01:01.570
 That is what our pure homage to that. I go to the source of all this beautiful religion. It comes

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.840
 from the compassion of non-attachment, non-grasp, and our homage to this.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:16.960
 That's what the great master is, the Chandrakriti. This compassion, if we put more division like

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.160
 that, I mean, this is, we are practicing, now learning.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:26.830
 We are practicing, we are going to practice this, this. That's called compassion, that is focused

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.520
 through the sentient beings.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:36.900
 And focused through the sentient beings, we wish everyone a great ritual. And everyone is going

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.600
 through very different challenges, as I said before, and you know, we all know.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:47.880
 Nothing secret, nothing mystery. Only some certain people know, and others don't know. It's truly,

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.560
 everybody knows. Everybody is going all the way through.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:59.690
 Therefore, feel compared to everyone. Wish to everyone good things. Remove all suffering, the

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.760
 difficult troubles. To every living beings.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:09.360
 And even they are looking, searching for joy and peace, happiness, descent, and peace, due to their

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:17.600
 ignorance. Due to our ignorance, we spoil, we destroy, even we want the joy and peace.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:24.200
 The very cause of that joy and peace, happiness, sometimes we must handle it. We lost, we destroy.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.000
 That's what the great master Chanti Deva said in his teachings.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.240
 Even you have to have, like to be happy, joy and all that, but through the ignorance, we destroy.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.720
 How pathetic, how alas, that is.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:45.200
 Therefore, feel great, compare to all the sentient beings, and wish and do this praise of the four

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.880
 boneless practices.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:53.440
 Those are the tools and methods these great teachers left for us. We should pick up those tools,

00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:01.230
 methods, and glorify them, and re-strengthen our practice and meditation with four boneless

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.760
 practices, for ourselves, to the others.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:12.770
 Then, what are we doing? Didn't we do any meaning for our lives? We will be happy, we will enjoy,

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:20.360
 we will be peaceful. Our life will have some meaning, meaning, some other dimension, even we have

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:26.150
 lateral meanings in the life on the surface, but this is something more meaningful, in the deeper

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.800
 levels.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:33.580
 So that is known as the compassion that directly connects with the sentient beings. Second

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:40.190
 compassion is known as the compassion, understanding of the meaning of the nature of this

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.760
 phenomenon, that is a little more deeper.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:50.560
 That means everything is in the subject of the permanent or they are in permanent status. All these

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.680
 beings, we all are like dream beings, we are like dreams.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:03.990
 Whether we recognize, whether we don't recognize, whether we highlight, whether we don't highlight,

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.640
 we are dreams, dream beings.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:15.750
 How these dreams are, and kind of thinking of that with great compassion, relaxing that net, whole

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:24.600
 universe and everything is in that status. It's just like magic, dream, mirage, status.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:33.510
 Bring up that natural quality and soften our regiment photo of the grasping claims, relax that.

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:39.560
 That is known as the compassion of the nature of the phenomenon.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:47.560
 Third compassion is the compassion of the absolute truth. Then, no focus, no grasping, no clinging.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.560
 That is known as beyond consciousness.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:56.580
 Feel great compassion in our heart and mind to all beings and relax our mind in the present state

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.520
 of nature. Relax, relax that.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:09.500
 There is no object, no subject, no action. Let transcendent our activities and our conceptions of

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.520
 these three phases. Relax in the present status.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:21.480
 That is known as absolute compassion. Absolute compassion.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:39.390
 Or sometimes in teaching said, compassion that has no discrimination, no focal point. It went

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.440
 beyond. And that blended completely with the great wisdom and energies. That is very relaxing, very

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:41.440
 refreshing, very soothing and calming.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:51.510
 We don't have to blow it out and think it all differently. Just let it be in the natural state as

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:55.400
 it is. That is third compassion.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.950
 And now that great compassion will appear in the poems, appear in the poem and the teaching. Then

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:12.990
 that is known as great avallakrishna. Our avallakrishna is the great compassion, absolute

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:18.360
 compassion of the Buddha Amitabha. Absolute compassion of the Gurdapara Masambhava.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:29.290
 Appearing the poem of our Gurdapara Masambhava is the true compassion, apparent in this poem, the

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:41.320
 daily form. And that we all practice, apparent in that form, to help all the beings.

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:49.450
 This compassion is no other than the Amitabha, no other than the Charyasai, no other than the Gurd

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:56.280
apara Masambhava. All that blended in, in one central state, appeared as great Charyasai.

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:09.110
 Charyasai, who is in body-marrow compassion, who is the compassion, who will ignite our great inner

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:12.970
 compassion by the Charyasai practices, meditation. It is in one way a mirror image of our nature of

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:16.240
 the deep compassion or the absolute compassion.

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:25.130
 It appeared in that form to rescue our deluded nightmare and nightmare of all beings and their

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:32.240
 career compassion. And here, that is what we pay homage. We pay homage to many different levels of

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.200
 understanding of this compassion.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:43.500
 And the Charyasai level, S.D.T level, Absolute level, and then, after all, the great compassion.

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:49.160
 Compassion, that is pinned strongly in our heart, in our mind.
