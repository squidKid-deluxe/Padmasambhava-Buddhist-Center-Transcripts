00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.160
 The subject is "mind." The subject is mind. The object is ever used. In other words, the object is

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.000
 sent to beings. The subject is our mind.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 And the mind has no measurements. Can we measure our mind? No, we cannot measure our mind.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.600
 No, we cannot measure the mind. Therefore, also we cannot measure love. We cannot measure

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.000
 compassion.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 We cannot measure joy. We cannot measure the economics. They are measureless.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:57.240
 Why does it not become immeasurable now many times? Because of our ego clinging. Ego clinging is

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.000
 making restrictions.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:10.870
 Otherwise, love is immeasurable, compassion is immeasurable, joy is immeasurable, and nature or

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.000
 economy or balance is immeasurable.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 So, bring out that quality, exactly as it is, then known as immeasurable.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.730
 And when we are emanating love and compassion, joy and equanimity, descent into beings, does that

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.000
 make shortage our love and compassion?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:41.470
 Shoulder, you are like, kind of like, finished, finished, exhausted? No. It is, there is a blend of

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.000
 more. It is just continually more.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:52.730
 More is therefore, it is called immeasurable. Object level is immeasurable, subject is immeasurable

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.000
, beneficial level is immeasurable.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 Beneficing omega in level to this, again, more the subject, object level.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 Benefiting to the object level, immeasurable, it really benefited to all sentient beings.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 As we spread out, to every sentient beings are going to benefit by that.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 So, object level is immeasurable. Subject level is immeasurable, benefit is immeasurable.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 It cleanses and purifies all of our obscurations.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 That you read, I mean, we read a lot of those teachings, by love and conviction, what's the thing?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 Developing that strongly beautiful is really cleansed, purified, inhaled, healed.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 So many things, it is so true.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 It benefitted to you, it benefitted to the others, and that was in the Buddha taking over and said,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 dual purpose.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 Performing the goals of others, performing the goals of one's own.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:04.480
 So it is, developing the bodhic jata, perform in the regular state, is what is called here, win-win

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.000
 situations.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 That's it, win-win situation.
