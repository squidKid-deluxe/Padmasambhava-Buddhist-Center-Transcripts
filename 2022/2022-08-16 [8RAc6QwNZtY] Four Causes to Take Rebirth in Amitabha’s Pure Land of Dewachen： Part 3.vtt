00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.530
 Thank you, everyone. Again, thank you. Welcome, everyone. Again, we continue discussing the

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:23.760
 teachings on the four causes that will take the rebirth in the pure land of the Buddha Amitabha.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:30.930
 That's what we are discussing, that. And so we will continue to talk on that. And yesterday we

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:40.120
 discussed it briefly, or we discussed it a little bit, about the four causes, the first one.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:48.150
 What the great teacher, Buddha Hyakyo Manu, said in the teaching of the Amitabha Sutra, said, "

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:57.930
Whoever thinks of this Buddha, of the, above the Buddha, again and again, think of the Buddha,

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.520
 Buddha Amitabha, again and again."

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:07.360
 So that, and also the pure land of the Buddha Amitabha, and as well as the Buddha Amitabha.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:16.300
 So we went yesterday briefly about that. Generally, Buddha Amitabha is not just the only Buddha of

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.460
 the wind we pass away.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:26.320
 Buddha Amitabha is the Buddha of also this life, and which is known as the Buddha Amitayum.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:34.740
 We often heard in Vajrayana teaching, there's so many empowerment, the Amitayum empowerment for the

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.560
 longevity and the prosperity.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:44.240
 So this Buddha Amitabha and the Buddha Amitayum are the same. There's no difference in the

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.520
 teachings, they're the same.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:54.390
 And why is, they're called, as I said yesterday, when this Buddha Amitabha, the lifespan of the

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.220
 Buddha Amitabha is countless.

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:04.140
 There's no really measurement, countless, the Buddha Hyakyo Manu said, "Therefore it is known as

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.420
 the Buddha Amitayum."

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:13.240
 Lifespans, according to the teaching of the Buddha Hyakyo Manu, when Buddha Amitabha reached

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.800
 enlightenment,

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:27.920
 when? It's ten eons ago, ten eons. For us it's ten eons, but for the beautiful Amitabha's beautiful

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.800
 is ten days, ten days.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:39.220
 One day in the beautiful of the Buddha Amitayum is one eons in our world where we are, according to

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.000
 the teaching of the Buddha.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.860
 So according to the standard of the Buddha Amitayum, Amitayum's beautiful land or Amitayum's

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.100
 beautiful land is ten years, ten days ago.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:57.300
 The Buddha got enlightenment and is leaving Buddha right now.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:05.100
 So therefore, this Buddha Amitabha is the Buddha of now, Buddha of the future, and Buddha to purify

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.700
 all our obscurations, obstacles,

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:16.220
 diseases, sicknesses, and well-being, and feast and fulfillment. All this is really the Buddha Amit

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.500
abha and Amitayum.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.500
 So that's what we should think. I will remember that.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:28.600
 And with this thought, again, I told a little bit really about this prayer.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:35.260
 The first we discussed yesterday, this one, the short one, in English it's translated, the blessed

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.200
 one, das Gond, subjubey, imiti,

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:44.700
 perfectly fully enlightened protector Amitabha. That's an English translation, of course, you see.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:54.710
 In it, in Tibet, what it is called, chum din de, tae, ji, kya, dra, chumba, yang, takbar, zukwe,

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.600
 sangji, gombo, upata, mepa.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:08.610
 So that's the Tibetan word. And in the Tibetan word, chum din de is translated into English,

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.000
 blessed one.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:20.600
 So I believe this is quite well-known translated, translated, bug one into blessed one.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:30.200
 But in Tibetan, chum din de, chum din de is three words, you see, chum din de, three words.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:38.640
 What it shows? It shows the Buddha is, it's generally, it's not just only the Buddha Amitabha's

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:39.300
 name,

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:46.990
 but it's the name to all the Buddhas. This can be all Buddhas, Buddha, khyakyamuni is the bug one

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.500
 too.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:55.100
 But what the, this chum din de is, tells two meanings every bit, I say briefly.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:03.300
 Chum means one who completely purifies all the obscurations, negativity in the defilements.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:12.600
 If I rapidly translate it, it is only, chum means one who destroy it, one uprooted, uprooted.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:26.020
 What destroy it? Two obscurations and four demons that completely eliminate it or destroy it, upro

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.700
oted, chum, chum.

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:38.320
 So chum means what? It shows perfectly purification, perfectly freed from all the negativities and

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.000
 obscurations, ego clings.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:50.100
 That's really the chum is. Chum, din means what? Positives, what is possessed?

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:58.400
 When you remove the old obscurations and negativities and four demons, what actualizes?

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:08.800
 It's wisdom and chaos. Who has? That means the perfect attainment. It shows perfect attainment.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:15.700
 Buddha is Amitabha or the Buddha, any Buddha is a perfect attainment, achievement.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:22.900
 There's nothing more to achieve, more to go. It's all achieved.

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:33.900
 They means what? In it with, beyond. Beyond the samsara and nirvana or beyond the dualities,

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:36.400
 totally beyond the dualities.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:45.100
 So that is the meaning of chum din, which is translated into English, blessed one.

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:51.460
 So you think it has the meaning that blessed one had that meaning or not, but it is well-known

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:55.100
 translated, well-known translated.

00:06:55.100 --> 00:07:00.700
 And I think that's what we use him, blessed one. Blessed one.

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:08.600
 And then next one is what? That's gone. That's referred to the absolute true nature.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:16.800
 So gone means rich enlightenment. So exactly rich enlightenment, where the nature is.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:23.150
 When Buddha reaches enlightenment, it's not something that strange things achieved and become the

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:23.900
 Buddha.

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:33.100
 When we become the Buddha, we're going to regain our treasure and nature, what we inherited.

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:38.600
 It's a basic nature, basic goodness that we regain.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:49.190
 Most of the time we are not thus gone, ourself, because of the negativities, obscurations, that we

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:50.600
 created.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:08:00.100
 It's a block to regain. So we're not thus gone. But Buddha is thus gone, thus referring to nature.

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:05.600
 Excalivate things, gain now, free from that. So that is.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:14.320
 And then because of that, and in Tibetan, what's called this subjuvayamity, again subjuvayamity is

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:15.100
 dajjumba.

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:24.230
 It's all those, this, all the great bodhisattvas, arhatas, and those are what we normally will use,

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:25.100
 arhatas.

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:35.600
 And the Buddhas are all known as arhatas. And it is subjuvayamity, and it means, dham means enemy.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:43.600
 And tjumba is again destroyed. So one who destroyed the enemy. What that means?

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:52.100
 Enemy is not just an opponent, which duality believes someone is disturbing our ego cling in our

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:54.600
 self-centered mind or our territory.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:09:04.100
 That is not. This case, the enemy is the ego clinging and grasping the duality.

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:10.100
 That is the ego clinging. That is all the Buddha teaching mentioned.

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:17.100
 This ego is the mostly enemy for us, all the time.

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:23.650
 It's just all the time making obstacles, not just one time, two times, or a short time, three times

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:25.100
, or three years.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:33.660
 It's ongoing. The ego and the self-important mind and the clinging is really disturbing our peace

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:35.100
 and happiness.

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:42.790
 It's full of that which is destroyed. Buddha. So this Buddha Amitabha, one who is destroyed, or

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:47.100
 Buddha Amitayu, all the egos and all the obscurations.

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:52.100
 Therefore, then he is perfectly fully enlightened. Perfectly.

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:58.100
 So this is just perfect. It's a perfect state. Because why we are not perfect?

00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:08.100
 Our ego clinging, our obscurations, duality is making the obstacle imperfections, even trying to do

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:10.100
, but it undermines.

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:17.140
 It undermines from the beginning. It undermines the well we are process. It undermines minding all

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:18.100
 the time.

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:27.760
 That is what the ego is, all of grasping and clinging. But Buddha is totally freed from that, so

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:30.100
 then fully enlightened.

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:37.290
 So this is all, in a way, synonym of the Buddha is tighter, but to any Buddha, this is used, but

00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:41.100
 this time is, of course, Buddha Amitabha or the Buddha Amitayu.

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:48.790
 And then the protractor, the protractor for all the living beings, without any partialities,

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:51.100
 without any discriminations.

00:10:51.100 --> 00:11:01.400
 That is the Buddha. So this is our object of refuge, our destinations, and this is our also source

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:03.100
 of inspiration.

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:13.090
 We like to become like this because we all inherited the same nature as Buddha Amitabha or the Amit

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:15.100
ayu or the Buddha Shakyamuni.

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:25.900
 As we walk for our own nature, according to where the nature is, truly we have the 100% right to

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:32.100
 achieve this, our right of the nature, what we have.

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:41.370
 So that is, and so that, up to that, is remembering, thinking of the Buddha Amitabha, or as a

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:47.100
 gracious teacher, Buddha said, remembering, thinking of the Buddha again and again.

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:53.640
 And as we discussed yesterday, a little bit, of course, I'm sure you know that, and also the beauty

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:58.100
 and the wondrous of the pure land of the Buddha Amitabha.

00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:05.100
 And Amitayu kind of thinking that, and that is our destination. That is our place.

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:13.130
 We are going to go to that place and going to fulfill all our wishes and inspiration on both each

00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:14.100
 other.

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:23.310
 Follow all that. And that's it. So what the great Master Raga Akshay said in his teachings, is

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:29.100
 definitely we can come back to this world, this earth, again and again.

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:38.180
 But there's so many challenges, birth, death, and getting old, sicknesses, death goes on and on, on

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:39.100
 and on.

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:47.280
 And that kind of, they eat it up all our time, because trying to keep up that kind of balance in

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:48.100
 that.

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:54.310
 And therefore, I think it's just perfect to be in a pure land of Amitabha, where everything is

00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:56.100
 beautiful, comfortable,

00:12:56.100 --> 00:13:00.100
 and there's no disturbance of the emotions.

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:06.640
 So I can fulfill my practice on both each other so easily there, and then I can benefit it and help

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:09.100
 it to all the beings with six veins.

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:12.100
 That's what the great Master Raga Akshay said.

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:21.770
 Going to the pure land of the Amitabha is a long goal to perform an achievement of our both each

00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:24.100
 other activities.

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:29.100
 So that is according to the teachings. So with this, then what the teachings said.

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:35.760
 Again, as we discussed yesterday, and not yesterday we discussed it, but in Buddha teachings, poor

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:37.100
 causes.

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:45.820
 So first is thinking of the Buddha in the pure land, again and again, thinking that when time comes

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:50.100
, I like to be departed to that places.

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:56.100
 Who's going to depart? Our consciousness, our mind, it's not just a wave, okay.

00:13:56.100 --> 00:14:01.670
 Again, great Master Raga Akshay said, Raga Akshay said, it's not something that you have to walk to

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:02.100
 there.

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:08.100
 You have to make arrangement to there, or go and buy a horse, or inch into a horse.

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:11.100
 Or it's not something that you fly with wings.

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:17.100
 It's the moment you think of the pure land of Amitabha when the time comes.

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:23.100
 That moment you will be in that pure land of your consciousness.

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:31.090
 When you are there in pure land of Amitabha, where you will be, you will be middle of the beautiful

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:33.100
 lotus, in the teachings said.

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:41.100
 Beautiful lotus, and the miraculously you appear from the lotus, as youthful.

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:46.100
 So there is no process of the conceptions, and that goes.

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:51.100
 It's instantly built from lotus, but youthful status.

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:59.320
 Therefore, it's again, we keep our mind, we set mind that our goal, according to teaching, is

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.100
 really so positive.

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:08.100
 Because also the Buddha Amitabha, or the Buddha Amitai, himself made aspirations.

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:16.100
 Whoever thinks of me, and willing to come to my pure land, they should come.

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:21.100
 They should be calm without any hindrance in their obstacles.

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:28.100
 Such commitment is not preferred. I'm not going to get enlightened. I'm not getting enlightened.

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:36.100
 So he made that commitment, and wishes, and as weak, and as preferred.

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:44.860
 Therefore, it's because our intention and commitment of the Buddha Amitabha combined together, and

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:50.100
 then we be in that place, according to teaching.

00:15:50.100 --> 00:16:00.110
 So that is what. And now with this thought, and then second cause, or second condition, cause, is

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:03.100
 to get rebuilt in pure land, Amitabha.

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:09.100
 And to fulfill our wishes of the bodhicitta is accumulated merit.

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:17.910
 Lord of accumulated merit in the teaching said, Lord of the virtuous activities performed, Lord of

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:21.100
 virtuous activities, activities.

00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:27.100
 Virtuous activities, what? It's virtue. What is virtuous, actually?

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:37.110
 Virtuous is not outside, nor non-virtuous is not outside. It all depends on our intention, as we

00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:41.100
 discussed on the day, I mean, you know.

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:50.210
 Virtuous, this mind is the key. Mind is the cause. Mind is the instrumental wherever we'd like to

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:54.100
 direct, whether virtuous or non-virtuous.

00:16:54.100 --> 00:17:02.100
 So virtuous activity comes from the virtuous mind, virtuous mind.

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:13.640
 What is a virtuous mind? Again, a symbol, not any mysteries, or it is Buddhist dharmas. It's a

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:18.100
 loving kindness, compassion, wisdom, joy, and application.

00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:25.980
 Those siddling call it, all symbolize bodhicitta thought in the heart and the mind, and do whatever

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:31.100
 activities by verbally, physically.

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:36.100
 That is virtuous. So perform the virtuous activity.

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:43.910
 This virtuous activity, again, I talk really this in the con, all the virtuous activities,

00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:50.890
 activities in the Buddha teaching, in the generally, both Suttara Mahayana teaching and Vayayana

00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:52.100
 Mahayana teaching,

00:17:52.100 --> 00:18:00.840
 there is seven tools to accumulate merit that you, we all know, we all heard so many times, and you

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:02.100
 all know.

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:09.100
 What are those seven? First is both stations, both stations.

00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:22.100
 Second is offerings. And the third is confessions.

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:40.980
 And the fourth is rejoice, or the joy, rejoice. And the fifth is recursing, recursing, turning the

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:43.100
 will of dharma.

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:57.100
 And the sixth is recursing to be long lives. And the seventh is dedicated merits.

00:18:57.100 --> 00:19:07.750
 So those are known as in its ability, the word says, Sosa Yena Dhampa, Sosa Yena Dhampa. Seven

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:12.100
 tools were accumulating the merits.

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:21.100
 So all accumulation, virtuous activities can be combined in these sevens.

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:27.340
 And now you, of course, you all know this. But again, I will go a little bit to each of those cut

00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:31.100
 point, just as reminding that.

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:46.380
 First is both stations. Both stations is what, actually? Both stations is antidote of the arrogance

00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:51.100
, antidote of arrogance.

00:19:51.100 --> 00:20:00.500
 And both stations also, that means we're seeing the good quality of others, or some really respect

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:12.100
 to the others, not become kind of egos, ego as like strong, solid, kind of iron, like arrogance.

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:22.880
 But respect and appreciation, it shows also our good quality of ours, ours, what called the humili

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:24.100
ations.

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:34.670
 Or humble, be humble. Humble and simple didn't mean it's going to devalue, going to last our

00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:36.100
 qualities.

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:46.110
 Actually, it was going to glorify our qualities, drawn to the earth, humble, simple, respect to the

00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:47.100
 others.

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:56.760
 This tradition of the respecting is all systems of the country has, every tradition, every country

00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:00.100
 has respect and appreciation.

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:10.100
 Even though maybe they don't name the both stations, but both stations means respect, appreciation.

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:20.100
 We all have that. East has that, and West has that, South has those qualities, those, everyone's.

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:28.290
 And there's a lot of different ways those perform how they do greetings. And some does for respect

00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:35.100
 and appreciation, comfortable, touch to head to head.

00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:43.100
 Some to touch to the jigs or right to the left with sound of keys, I think, and embracing that.

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:47.100
 That is also respect and appreciation.

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:55.100
 Appreciation feels kind of warmness. And then sometimes, keys is to the ground.

00:21:55.100 --> 00:22:01.820
 And then in a different tradition has a different kind of way to respect the Christianity, touching

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:06.100
 to the different part of the bodies as gesture of the crosses.

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:11.100
 That means I'm comfortable, I'm happy, I honor, I respect.

00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:21.650
 And it's a very Buddhism is tradition started from India, we do put it hand as India, put it hand

00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:26.100
 and then bow down on the ground.

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:32.100
 And then some traditions even touching to the feet of the people.

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:43.180
 I mean, they have different ways. All is what symbolize, feel comfortable, warmness, respect and

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:46.100
 appreciation and honor.

00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:56.100
 It is our ego and the kind of like that is low. And arrogance is low. See something, good things.

00:22:56.100 --> 00:23:03.100
 So therefore, it is very powerful, powerful way to do to the postulations.

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:07.600
 And that is with this is thought and then do the postrations and the Buddha's teaching, postrations

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:18.380
 and those postrations, which is known as then postation with meditate, meditate, with meditation

00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:25.090
 levels and postrations with just as regular ways and meditations of then, then absolute levels,

00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:27.100
 postrations.

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:34.100
 Those old teaching said, I'm sure you all know, I'm not going to go all those details. But however,

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:41.100
 and when we do postations, for example, meditate levels, again, same with respect and appreciation.

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:48.790
 But we are kind of like, like, multiply the ourself, so many emanations, ourself, meditate level is

00:23:48.790 --> 00:23:55.840
 like visualization, even though it's not exactly with the legislation is the more counter imag

00:23:55.840 --> 00:24:02.100
inations, multiple other so many times, like countless.

00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:07.750
 And then we are making postaction to the Amitabha. Feel see the call it and goodness and all that

00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:09.100
 we do the postations.

00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:14.100
 So this is known as the antidote of the arrogance.

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:18.100
 The next one is the offering.

00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:24.100
 Offering is the antidote of the miserly and attachments.

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:33.580
 Offering is also generous. Justness. What do you make offerings, offering our own belongings, what

00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:41.100
 we own, and as well as mentally and in the imagination or the Samadhi meditate powers.

00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:47.160
 Those are you made offerings without grasping and clinging to the Buddha Amitabha and all the

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:53.100
 Buddha's bodhisattva every enlightenment as a Mandela offerings or like offering.

00:24:53.100 --> 00:25:00.100
 It is antidote of the attachment and miseries, miseries.

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:27.280
 And then by regularly multiplying meditate level meditate level is then in the Vediana teaching

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:27.570
 often said those are all articles are multiplied by the mantra meditation and the mother as through

00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:27.810
 that is multiplied and then all become divine call it or the wisdom call it and making the offering

00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:29.100
 to all living beings.

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:35.520
 And that also in the teaching said actually when you make the offering there is a three, three

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:38.100
 purity status, three purities.

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:46.510
 What are those three purity states? The purity of the object, purity of intention, purity of the

00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:56.080
 articles, articles, what means those purity of the object means the purity of the object discuss

00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:57.100
 Buddha Amitabha.

00:25:57.100 --> 00:26:05.820
 And all the Buddha's bodhisattvas such as our Lokini Shora, Genes, Gaurabhema Sambhata, those all

00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:07.100
 feel the right in front of our space.

00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:13.420
 They're looking to us with eye of love and a complete as a living Buddha, a rainbow Buddha right

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:14.100
 there.

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:24.100
 And so that is our object of purity objects, object of our offerings where you're going to offer.

00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:30.100
 It's perfect. We're not just giving this someone can relate with the strange ways to someone.

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:37.100
 But purity full of love and a complete and Muslims. So that is purity of objects.

00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:44.410
 Then purity of the article means it is also not just something stolen or robbed by or kind of

00:26:44.410 --> 00:26:50.100
 strange kind of quietly sneakily making come to gather in something.

00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:56.100
 Had to know those any negative negative call it this is pure.

00:26:56.100 --> 00:27:04.100
 And those pure things are generated in the teaching said what our own belongings, such as our body,

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:07.100
 our wallet, our meritually activities.

00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:13.100
 Plus all this universe and the world, everything see as our luxury call it this.

00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:20.100
 And that is which we own or maybe we don't own but mentally gather all the beauty and everything,

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:22.100
 the universe and everything.

00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:29.100
 And then then we make that offering. So that is pure purity articles.

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:33.100
 And then third one is pure intentions.

00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:40.790
 We make these offerings, not just with the kind of like we like to gain some some power or some

00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:44.100
 some degree of the kind of authorities.

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:48.100
 Our intention is purely best upon the body.

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:53.100
 Like to reach enlightenment, like to benefit of all the sentient beings.

00:27:53.100 --> 00:28:00.350
 And I like to be reborn in the pure land of Amitabha order to fulfill our wish and the goal of the

00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:01.100
 body.

00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:04.100
 As I said many times early and you know.

00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:14.110
 So intention is pure, pure heart and pure object of ventilation, pure object of offering articles

00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:15.100
 and pure intentions.

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:17.100
 With that make offering.

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:22.100
 Then is the great meritually activities, big meritually.

00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:30.300
 Next one and the purification in front of the again in the presence of the Buddha Amitabha and all

00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:33.100
 the Buddha's bodies are the enlightened beings.

00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:41.520
 We purify all our negative it is from the beginners times that we don't know or we what we remember

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:45.100
 or maybe we don't remember everything.

00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:46.100
 We are purified.

00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:47.100
 We cleanse them.

00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:56.100
 How we purify with the four powers that we learned in the bundle practices with the four powers.

00:28:56.100 --> 00:29:02.100
 But this bundle practice, the object, power of the object is the Buddha Veda Sattva.

00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:09.100
 This time is Amitabha and all the Buddha's bodhisattvas.

00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:12.100
 And then same thing.

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:21.760
 Four powers, power of the object, power of the acknowledgement of our misdeeds and wrong deeds and

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:29.100
 power of the restoring power, power of the applying the antidotes.

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:36.100
 Those four and of course you all know and purify all our observations.

00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:45.500
 And this purification or compassion practice is in the teaching said is the antidote of anger as we

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:47.100
 purify that.

00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:49.100
 And so it is.

00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:52.100
 So that is the third accumulation merit practices.

00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:57.100
 And the fourth one is, I'm going to show you this here, a reduce.

00:29:57.100 --> 00:30:05.100
 Rejoice or the joy is the antidote of the jealous. Jealous.

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:07.100
 This time we rejoice.

00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:12.100
 All the good activities, good deeds of anyone is doing in the world.

00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:16.100
 Those noble ones are doing good activity or dead.

00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:21.100
 And all the old dead beings are doing good activity to benefit other beings.

00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:28.350
 Bring the peace and harmony to the world. Really, we join our intention with their good deeds and

00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:32.100
 thankful, grateful, all those which were activities.

00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:37.100
 We joined our intention with all the Buddha's bodhisattvas out of their activities.

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:39.610
 Where they develop the bodhicitta and where they continually check the journey of all those path

00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:44.100
 and bhumis.

00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:47.100
 And we thank for all these Buddha's enlightened.

00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:50.100
 Now they're continually helping benefit for all the sentient beings.

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:52.100
 How wonderful, how beautiful.

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:54.100
 I like to predict that.

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:58.100
 Wishing that in its heart, really praying that.

00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:04.100
 That this is called rejoice or the antidote of the jealousness.

00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:08.100
 And the next one is something tricky of this year, of course.

00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:12.100
 And the request and turning will of Dharma.

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:18.100
 This is the antidote of the ignorance, the request of the teachings.

00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:24.100
 And the teachings say that generally there is many Buddhas, great enlightened beings,

00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:29.100
 who reach enlightenment in a different universe, not yet maybe turning the will of Dharma.

00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:35.470
 Or there's so many great masters with their dharas, male and female, who reach, have the highest

00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:36.100
 realization,

00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:41.100
 yet they're not, some different reasons, they're not turning the will of Dharma or teaching.

00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:46.100
 Will of Dharma means world of wisdom and compassion.

00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:48.100
 World of wisdom, compassion.

00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:54.100
 If they turn, they expound that it will activate our love and compassion

00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:59.100
 and bring peace and harmony, reduce all negativities.

00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:02.100
 This is powerful means to observe that heart.

00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:06.100
 So we're of course turning the will of Dharma.

00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:08.100
 What in the teachings said, what we've joined here,

00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:14.100
 according to the readiness of the individual, please turn the will of Dharma.

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:19.100
 According to the readiness, not forceful, not imposing,

00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:24.100
 but the readiness of the individual there, what they can connect with.

00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:29.100
 What the teachings are, then those all nayana teachings,

00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:33.100
 out of three teachings, in and under teachings,

00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:37.100
 and out of the under teaching, in and under teaching,

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:43.100
 all those teachings really are caused to turn the will of Dharma, according to their readiness.

00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:46.100
 Readiness of the individual.

00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:54.100
 So that is the pit, I think, accumulation practices.

00:32:54.100 --> 00:33:10.100
 And next one is, bring long life prayers or not returning to the nirvana status.

00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:25.100
 This is a kurwa, this is a kurwa.

00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:31.100
 It is a rakosna to stay long life.

00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:36.100
 It is an antidote of the wrong ideas.

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:38.100
 Wrong ideas, is it?

00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:43.100
 But I'm translating it as wrong ideas.

00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:46.100
 So, rakosna, those are great beings,

00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:49.100
 beings who are, can't really going to enter,

00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:53.100
 even though they have the perfect capability to prolong their lives and all that,

00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:58.100
 but they have some degree, somehow they're going to enter Mahaparin nirvanas.

00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:02.100
 So they're rakosna, or you rakosna, wherever that is.

00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:10.100
 This is an ask for eons, and without entering the Mahaparin nirvanas, to benefit all living beings.

00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:13.100
 And this is also known as lungi, we depress.

00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:17.100
 Whoever we do pray for long life and good wishes to the others,

00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:22.100
 that will prolong our lives, our life, our energy.

00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:25.100
 It's not something that we're going to lose.

00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:34.100
 Actually, it will really prolong, prolong our life, our energy, our prosperity.

00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:37.100
 So therefore, we will pray this, this.

00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:42.100
 A last one is, is dedication.

00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:46.100
 Dedication is antidote of doubt and hesitations,

00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:50.100
 doubt and hesitations, and dedicate the merits.

00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:54.100
 And that is, then all the good deeds, whatever we did,

00:34:54.100 --> 00:35:01.100
 in the kind of like, on gross levels, or on kind of very subtle levels,

00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:13.100
 and in the, I mean, not in the teaching set, that, and,

00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:30.100
 and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,

00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:35.100
 accumulate the merit and we're really going to share that.

00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:40.500
 And that energy to help and benefit all the sentient beings

00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:45.500
 and to be born ourselves and as well as all the beings

00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:47.460
 to the pure land of Amitabha.

00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:50.880
 Reaching dead and the dead they get their merit.

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:54.140
 This is known as then dead they can praise.

00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:59.140
 So those all are known as seven tools that occur

00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:02.860
 accumulate the merits.

00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:07.480
 These also combine all the six paramata practices too.

00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:11.380
 Each of those we have the kind of a deep time

00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:16.040
 and the energy and that is generosity.

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:19.540
 And then we, each of those we do with very clear

00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:23.660
 and pure mind and the nice way kind of need and a clean way

00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:25.700
 and that is moralities.

00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:27.860
 And then we are also like some more patient

00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:30.500
 and kind of like courage and commitment

00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:34.740
 to perform all those practices with good that is,

00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:38.900
 is patient paramatas.

00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:41.260
 Then we put the effort, joyful effort

00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:44.740
 to put these virtuous practices, that's joyful effort.

00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:48.020
 Each of those we concentrate in exactly as the meaning

00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:52.100
 maintain our mind that is is.

00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:54.620
 Then concentrate the paramatas.

00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:58.020
 And each of those we see clearly not kind of mixed up

00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:02.140
 really trying to do precisely on the conception level

00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:06.020
 trying to do those, those are the then wisdom paramatas

00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:11.020
 of the what's called the wisdom paramatas.

00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:16.860
 When we do those seven practice without any grasping,

00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:20.520
 clinging subject and object and actions,

00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:24.860
 that is then wisdom paramatas or what's called

00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:27.320
 the wisdom meritas.

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:32.320
 So it's a complex and all two accumulations.

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:35.420
 Accumulation merit and wisdom meritas.

00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:39.740
 Therefore in the teaching said it's so powerful,

00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:42.300
 so special, these are really we think that.

00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:45.600
 And with that, together all the virtuous activities,

00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:50.600
 awarding 10 non-virtues that you all know.

00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:52.460
 You all the 10 non-virtues.

00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:57.060
 Activating the 10 virtues of the opposite

00:37:57.060 --> 00:38:00.060
 of the 10 non-virtues.

00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:03.900
 Those 10 you all know, I just say the group those.

00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:08.900
 And those are the un-virtuous activity by three by the body

00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:16.060
 and four by the speech and three by the mind

00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:21.220
 all together 10 non-virtues.

00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:25.820
 When you keep up there, not performing those activities

00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:30.820
 plus you do opposite of those 10 non-virtues activity,

00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:34.820
 then it becomes the positives, the virtues,

00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:38.940
 perfect virtues and do that with the body together.

00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:41.700
 Thinking all the sentient beings really wishing

00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:45.340
 may I do this benefit for all living beings

00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:47.820
 and may they get enlightenment by this.

00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:52.820
 May I never do any non-virtues activities forever

00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:56.420
 by the blessings of the Buddha Amitabha

00:38:56.420 --> 00:39:00.900
 and the Gaurabhama, Sambharvacharya and all that.

00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:03.500
 All these Buddhas, bodhisattvas, they're blessings.

00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:08.100
 Really feel that from heart and do those prayers.

00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:12.540
 And that is known as then, then all virtuous activities.

00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:15.540
 And all these activities without grasping,

00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:17.620
 clinging, kind of holding onto that

00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:19.980
 or I did get it, things and all these things.

00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:22.340
 Without that and just blend in,

00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:26.140
 in the absolute state of true nature as a zoki meditation,

00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:28.960
 that is a Western meditation, that.

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:31.380
 And then it that's called in the teaching always

00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:33.860
 is union of the two meditists.

00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:37.180
 Accumulation merit, Western merit.

00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:39.700
 That is perfect, beautiful.

00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:44.700
 And that is, is the cause to be,

00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:49.780
 to be reached or cause and condition

00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:54.780
 to back, reborn in the field and Amitabhas, Amitabhas.

00:39:54.780 --> 00:40:00.820
 So among those four causes, now what I've been, I did.

00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:05.580
 The fourth one, and the object of the Buddha Amitabha

00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:07.660
 and the Beulah and Brili.

00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:10.460
 And now today we discuss the Brili,

00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:11.780
 again, I mean, it's not something

00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:15.300
 that I'm talking new things you don't know.

00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:18.100
 I'm in a way reminded to all of us

00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:20.460
 to reap in some really, hopefully,

00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:24.540
 re-breaking our knowledge, knowledge of that,

00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:28.220
 those accumulated practices, that.

00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:29.780
 And that is what.

00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:32.100
 And the third one is,

00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:35.600
 what great teacher Buddha Shakyamuni said in the teaching,

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:41.620
 bodhicitta, bodhicitta, that is a third.

00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:45.980
 But again, of course, all that is within the bodhicitta

00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:50.340
 frames, everything, that is really the,

00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:54.220
 what is bodhicitta and rafujis.

00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:57.660
 What is bodhicitta?

00:40:57.660 --> 00:40:59.960
 It's a comparison, loving kindness thought

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:01.800
 for all living beings.

00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:08.260
 From the core of our heart, that is bodhicitta.

00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:12.580
 And then, what is this bodhicitta?

00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:22.580
 And what is this absolute bodhicitta?

00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:27.180
 Absolute bodhicitta is not grasping, clinging,

00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:30.700
 any of those things, even as a comparison,

00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:33.500
 even loving kindness, so big and powerful,

00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:36.420
 yet, no, grasping, clinging.

00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:39.620
 That is, what's the merit, merit?

00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:43.260
 That is what's called absolute relative true bodhicitta

00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:45.500
 and absolute true bodhicitta.

00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:47.700
 So this bodhicitta, true bodhicitta.

00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:50.540
 And now, relative bodhicitta, of course,

00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:53.380
 again, we heard so many times,

00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:57.260
 we're trying to do, all of us are trying to do practice.

00:41:57.260 --> 00:42:00.980
 Those bodhicittas are started with

00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:04.780
 loving kindness, compassion, and good heart.

00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:09.780
 Without any sub-centered mind, that heart, that qualities.

00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:15.700
 We need to come to the activity and then to exercise that.

00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:19.380
 To activate that, again, gracious teacher,

00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:23.900
 the Buddha Shakyamuni taught in the teaching, poor, boundless,

00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:25.220
 that we all know.

00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:27.620
 We all heard so many times,

00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:30.020
 even though maybe we really don't know too much,

00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:34.420
 but we heard, it feels our, it sense our heart.

00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:38.420
 It's suffering our heart, really, it is.

00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:40.420
 And which is poor, boundless?

00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:43.340
 Boundless, loving kindness.

00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:44.780
 Boundless, compassion.

00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:51.300
 Boundless, rejoice or the joy.

00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:55.100
 Boundless, equanimities.

00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:58.020
 Those are poor, boundless.

00:42:58.020 --> 00:43:02.660
 Among these poor, boundless, in the many teachings,

00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:07.340
 the boundless, equanimity is, in a way, foundation.

00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:12.340
 Foundation of the boundless, loving kindness.

00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:15.860
 Boundless of compassion.

00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:17.820
 Boundless of joy.

00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:21.700
 Why is it be like foundation?

00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:26.300
 Because it, when you have that equanimity attitude,

00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:29.860
 we're not so grasping, clinging onto that.

00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:34.860
 It is become so blended in, gentle, peaceful, mellow.

00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:39.540
 It's very, it's not become emotional.

00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:45.140
 Love and compassion, joy and appreciation,

00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:47.580
 generally, of course, is good, always.

00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:49.860
 But according to the bodhicitta,

00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:54.860
 love and compassion, joy should not be emotional.

00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:59.580
 Emotional love and compassion and joy

00:43:59.580 --> 00:44:02.460
 is all the sense in being have, some degree.

00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:05.740
 All human being have some degree.

00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:08.380
 Emotion, which is good?

00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:12.340
 Love and compassion and joy, always good.

00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:16.220
 But true being acts like bodhicitta,

00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:20.900
 love and compassion and joy.

00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:25.460
 No, trying to not be emotions, not too tight.

00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:26.820
 It's pervasive.

00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:28.620
 Therefore, it's called boundless.

00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:32.340
 Boundless love to all the beings.

00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:36.260
 And what in the equanimity says,

00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:39.180
 may I have the great equanimity realization,

00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:41.380
 those who are close to me,

00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:43.500
 or those who are part of the strength to me.

00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:47.620
 So this is what the love is.

00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:51.340
 All pervasive loving kindness to every living beings.

00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:55.900
 Those we know, those we don't know.

00:44:55.900 --> 00:44:58.900
 All beings and compassion is the same.

00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:03.900
 And as well as joy is the same.

00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:05.220
 And that, you know.

00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:09.060
 And when it's sittling that quality in a heart and mind,

00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:12.940
 and then perform the six paramata activity,

00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:17.580
 or perform the seven tools that accumulate the merits.

00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:23.260
 Meritus, that is then one of the cause,

00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:28.020
 or third cause to be born in the people and Amitabha.

00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:31.820
 Amitabha, and it is a great tool

00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:35.700
 to purify our obscurations, negativities,

00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:37.660
 and regain our nature.

00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:40.980
 We are revealing our nature, our Buddha nature.

00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:45.780
 And we are activating, we are advancing.

00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:48.140
 Really we are advancing to the Father.

00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:53.140
 And we are embracing everything as a part,

00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:56.260
 when we have these realizations.

00:45:56.260 --> 00:45:57.820
 Realizations.

00:45:57.820 --> 00:46:01.740
 And that, so those are known as the third cause,

00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:04.540
 or third conditions.

00:46:04.540 --> 00:46:09.420
 Or conditions to be born in the people and Amitabhas.

00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:11.300
 Again, in the Buddha teaching said,

00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:16.300
 "Whoever think of me, and do the good activities,

00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:20.580
 "and do the also have the body of the good heart,

00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:24.580
 "and making the aspirations to the people and Amitabha,

00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:31.380
 "they were born, take the birth in the people and."

00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:34.780
 That's what the really Buddha Amitabha said,

00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:37.060
 and Buddha Shakyamuni repeated that.

00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:38.780
 That.

00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:42.500
 So that is my brilliant talk about today, this portal.

00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:46.140
 We went now really about the third post,

00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:47.700
 second and third.

00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:50.940
 We went, and again, I'm so thankful,

00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:53.020
 and grateful to all of you,

00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:58.020
 and Rashi Delis, and we are making nice ground walk

00:46:58.020 --> 00:47:01.260
 to be born in the people and Amitabha.

00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:03.300
 And so, thank you, everyone.

00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:05.940
 Thank you, everyone, okay.

00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:06.820
 Thank you.

00:47:06.820 --> 00:47:08.700
 Again, we do short dedication.

00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:11.100
 That completes our first session.

00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:15.260
 Session, and then second session, same thing as we did yesterday.

00:47:15.260 --> 00:47:19.900
 We do, again, our evening practice

00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:22.700
 of the Pima Samyala Monastery we used to.

00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:25.820
 Please, if you have time, join with us,

00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:28.380
 and then we dedicate the marriage.

00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:30.140
 Okay, thank you, everyone.

00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:33.260
 (Silence)

00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:02.460
 - Wrong doing.

00:48:02.460 --> 00:48:05.260
 - From the stormy waves of the birth of all the sickness

00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:07.940
 and death from the ocean of the samsara,

00:48:07.940 --> 00:48:09.700
 may I pray all beings.
