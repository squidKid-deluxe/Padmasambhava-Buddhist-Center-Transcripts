00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.840
 These three, morality, contemplation, or concentration, and wisdom, these all three combine

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:08.700
 together.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:15.990
 When people kind of preserve that and observe that very strongly, and keep that in track to call it

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.400
 just perfectly,

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:26.000
 then realization is just a bloom, one after another, and that whole period, in a way, 300 times, or

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 300 times, 500,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:36.100
 is very much of the realization time, and proper keep those preserved very much.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:45.500
 But regularly, post-500 is very big, big of that, and so, therefore, it is often named that 300,

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:57.380
 or 500 times, or 300, which is 1,500, I think, is named as the time of the realization, time of the

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.500
 harvest, harvest strength to the fruit period.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.500
 "Tien zhanig ha bhi asamtaya, yang ha bhi asamtaya," "Tien zhanig ha bhi asamtaya," "Tien zhanig ha

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.500
 bhi asamtaya,"

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.500
 "Tien zhanig ha bhi asamtaya," "Tien zhanig ha bhi asamtaya," "Tien zhanig ha bhi asamtaya," "Tien

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.500
 zhanig ha bhi asamtaya,"

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.500
 "Tien zhanig ha bhi asamtaya," "Tien zhanig ha bhi asamtaya," "Tien zhanig ha bhi asamtaya," "Tien

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.500
 zhanig ha bhi asamtaya,"

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:15.270
 then it divided again. Furthermore, it said, after that, then teaching could again continually, but

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.500
 that time is known as then.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:27.920
 500 times, again three, or literally, 503 times is then known as the period of the scratch, more

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.500
 kind of academic systems.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:38.240
 "Tien zhanig ha bhi asamtaya," "Tien zhanig ha bhi asamtaya," "Tien zhanig ha bhi asamtaya," "Tien

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.500
 zhanig ha bhi asamtaya,"

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.500
 and this scripture is connected to the Buddha's three teachings, such as three Bhaskar teachings,

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.500
 Vinaya teaching, Abhidharma, Sutra and Abhidharma.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:02:00.600
 So again, divided into that three, those are time, more kind of academic studying, studying of

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.500
 these three Bhaskar teachings, or related with the three Bhaskar teachings.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.920
 "Tien zhanig ha bhi asamtaya," "Tien zhanig ha bhi asamtaya," "Mabhi asamtaya," "Som." "Som" is

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.500
 that always said.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.500
 "Tien zhanig ha bhi asamtaya," "Tien zhanig ha bhi asamtaya," "Tien zhanig ha bhi asamtaya," "Tien

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.500
 zhanig ha bhi asamtaya,"

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:38.500
 "Tien zhanig ha bhi asamtaya," "Tien zhanig ha bhi asamtaya," "Tien zhanig ha bhi asamtaya," "Tien

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.500
 zhanig ha bhi asamtaya," "Tien zhanig ha bhi asamtaya,"

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:46.410
 Three times five hundred is one thousand, five hundred, one thousand, five hundred, so three, three

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:47.500
 thousand.
