Bring up compassion and love for all beings including those close to you, and sincerely wish that they all enjoy happy and healthy long lives, all of their obstacles are removed, all their wishes for happiness and peace are fulfilled, that their realization increases, and that everyone quickly achieves enlightenment. Also pray for the long and healthy lives of all the lineage masters and world peacemakers, and that all of their wishes are quickly and perfectly fulfilled.\n\nRecite the Dusum Sangye Prayer of Guru Padmaambhava with devotion while wisdom rainbow light rays continuously stream out from Guru Rinpoche's heart center in every direction. The light rays then return back to Guru Rinpoche who blesses you. He then dissolves into a sphere of light which enters your crown and merges into your heart center. Then remain in meditation, abiding in the true nature for as long as you have time for. Conclude by dedicating the merit to all beings.",

 "Tachidele's, tachidele's, and Happy New Year, and every country has beautiful New Years, and Happy

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.700
 New Year's, New Year's to everyone, and happy in health.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:27.580
 And I'd also like to say that many of these past years, we had great opportunity to accumulate the

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:35.400
 merit through the Mantra practices and dedicate the merit for all beings into the world.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:43.930
 Peace and our own, these well-being, say, everywhere, every time. So we had really wonderful other

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:51.510
 way to the merit and benefit your activity to get us that reflect our bodhichitta, which is our

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.500
 very heart of the practices.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:03.610
 So it's been very, very beautiful development so many these years. And I'd like to also encourage

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:19.830
 every practitioner that they can also increase more bodhichitta through that and the practices and

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:20.240
 dedicate it to the world peace and as well as well beings throughout the generations and all the

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.500
 central beings, as teaching said.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:30.490
 In a particular this year, I thought maybe we can practice in accumulating such as very famous and

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:39.500
 powerful practices, known as Dusamsanji and Murubuji, and short practices of the Murubemasambhava

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.500
 that removes all obstacles and following the wishes.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:52.950
 This practice is also a renowned and very special powerful practice of the Dijanriya times, when

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.500
 the world is facing so many difficult troubles and all over places.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.500
 And this is what really in the teaching said, it's one of the very powerful practices.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:11.290
 In a particular, this teaching is discovered by very famous new material known as Churya Devinlampa

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:18.500
, along with very famous great master, Yavmukunthod and great chansei.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:31.660
 This is the three great master. In a way, they all together discovered, blessed and then taught

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.500
 this teaching and spread it out since then to every practitioner that is practicing this.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:42.540
 It's very strongly open. And so, he's on the Dijanriya, but he also, I encourage you to practice

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.500
 this one, as well as even he wrote commentaries on this teaching.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:53.500
 So I just really like to encourage you, and we can accommodate these practices for all reasons.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:00.970
 To ourselves, to the family, and for the world, and then for the peace and happy, harmony and the

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:07.500
 performance of all our wishes, remove all obstacles and obstacles, diseases.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.500
 So there is that we wish, really pray for this practice, if we can. That will be wonderful.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:19.780
 And again, in the group, joint togat practices, we all hand-set togat in with one voice, giant

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:27.500
 bread, still gurupa, masambhavas, embodiment of all enlightenment, Buddha, dharmasanga.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:34.480
 And at any root, all the time says, so many of you already know how important and powerful and

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:41.500
 special Buddha of Gurupa and Masambhavas, to kind of bring that understanding very strongly,

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:47.500
 and with devotion and the beautiful thought and attitude, practice, it is, that's wonderful.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:54.860
 And thank you, again, we can do togat of Gurupas, togat of wonderful, and we dedicate that again

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.500
