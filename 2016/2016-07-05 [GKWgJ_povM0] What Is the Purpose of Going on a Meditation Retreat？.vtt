00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360
 In the West, a lot of people don't understand exactly what it means to do a retreat, and they don't

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.000
 understand why someone would go away.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.500
 Could you talk more about how we can relate skillfully to people in our own lives to help them

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.000
 understand the importance and the meaning of the retreat,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 so that way they aren't feeling hurt or neglected by our commitments?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:29.080
 Generally, people who come to retreat, I think, definitely they already know some sense of retreat.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.000
 That's why they came, but maybe they don't know exactly that.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.560
 The retreat, as I think I mentioned, retreat in the Indian world, in Tibet, is called "Sam". "Sam"

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:48.000
 means really you are stopping on all the mundane activities,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 mundane activities of the body, mundane activities of the speech, mundane activities of the mind,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 and so that is you are really retreating and stopping that.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.480
 When you are retreating, what activities can you do? Perfectly that. Then, instead of mundane

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.000
 activities of the body, you start with that,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 and then in the Tibetan Buddhism, what is the body? According to the body activity of the retreat,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 and then some Dharma activities.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.060
 Sometimes, for example, the "Sakkama Ambulance", the body, "Sakkama Ambulance" to the stupas, or

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.000
 the temples, and the ball stations.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.140
 Ball stations, all those are known as amidicis, and then there are also many other things, but I

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.000
 won't talk, but those are like the body activities, such as that.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:49.050
 And then, speech activities, again, stopping all those, the speech, verbal muddings, verbal

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.000
 activities, and stop that,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 and do the speeches, such as reciting mantara, chanting the prayers, and reading sutras.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.530
 And then, those are known as the mundane, stopping the mundane activities of the speech, and

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.000
 engaging to the spiritual verbal use, using those things,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.490
 with the spiritual or the Dharma things. And the mundane activities of the mind is then, again,

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.000
 trying to stop preventing all the emotions,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.460
 all the negative emotions, negative, these are negative emotions, stopping all the negative

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:28.000
 emotions,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 and cultivate more positive thoughts, joy, appreciation, love, kindness, compassion, and bodhicata.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.650
 And then, really, those are brain, devotion, those are brain, more than what it will do, it will

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.000
 bring mind.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:53.150
 What it brings, more calm, more peaceful, more soothing, more calming, and in mind that happens, it

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.000
 will really kind of igniting,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 it is radiating that energy to the channels, to the wings, and to the physical level.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 And then our bodies will become also relaxed and calm in that, so cultivate that.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 Those are generally kind of external levels of the retreats.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 Then, particularly, zoki retreat, then really engage into the meditation, as we are all doing,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 doing that,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.870
 trying to do more meditating, more practicing, follow the according, the instruction, and follow

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.000
 our schedules, that we can do that.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 And not kind of interfering, you know, interfering each other, others practices that, so everyone

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 kind of encourage each other, practices,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.560
 not interfering, such as, this is the break, the time, time, and one come for one month, all at one

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.000
 week, two weeks,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.410
 and that's really dedicated for that. So therefore, really cultivating that as much as we can, and

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.000
 supporting each other,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.840
 and that is not it then, kind of helping and supporting, and not kind of like, also preventing or

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.000
 diluting,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 but just let everybody do the practice, the meditate, whatever they can do.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 That is like their own way of activating that. So those are that, I will say, I think.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 It's okay if I ask one more question?

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 Yes.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 But for those who aren't in retreat with us, so for those who aren't in retreat with us,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:31.040
 so like if we're doing like an extended retreat, and there's loved ones that we have to step away

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.000
 from,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 what are skillful ways to relate to those who don't have the connection to Buddhism, maybe,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 but they're still affected by us being in retreat?

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 Those who are not in retreat, right?

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 Family.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 So like family or loved ones?

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:53.520
 So I think that they know already, they know that you're doing retreat, and I'm sure they're

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.000
 morally supported,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 supporting that, and so they know that. But then you're in retreat, that's how we do prayer.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 Bodhicitta prayer. So we're doing these practices, not just only for ourselves,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 but really, at the very beginning, we started with bodhicitta,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 thought where we sent it based and prayed towards them.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 At the end, we dedicate the merit, and also we wish everyone affected by our merit and our joy,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 and not just only our merit, as we wish that all the bodhisattvas, in light of being,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 their blessings are also merged with our prayer, our wishes, and then went to those all beings.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 So they kind of like, we kind of like send that to everyone, everyone.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 Our prayers and our merit, and as well as their blessings over all the bodhisattvas, to everyone.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 Thank you very much.
