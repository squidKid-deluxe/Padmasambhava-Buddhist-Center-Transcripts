00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.500
 These are the three things for the two practices of any teaching or the secret Dhanthara teachings.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:14.000
 Empowerment, transmission, and instructions or pith instructions. Those are the three are very,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.500
 very important.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:22.500
 And so what I did to him was I did the empowerment. We went through all that.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.500
 Now I give the transmission. Transmission means I'm going to read this.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:33.500
 Also, I give empowerment, not just I started that empowerment, but I received that empowerment.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.500
 I practiced that as much as I can, and then I offered you in with that.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:44.870
 There are persons of the life, persons of the beginning, they need a master, and as much as can

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.500
 build up my good heart.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.500
 And I offer that empowerment.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.500
 Now I give the transmission. I also not just I'm reading this because I want,

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.500
 because I received this as my last mission.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:04.500
 It's also not I received from my teaching, but the received is a long-lost lineage in teachings.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:11.730
 Empowerment, last mission, that's what the authenticity of the teaching, well-preserved with those

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:13.500
 skills and techniques.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.140
 And also it's kept the blessings, and not spoiled by the intellectual attitude, this and that

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.500
 thought,

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:27.500
 this experiment, it isn't that thing. It really kept, as I used the word, distilled waters.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.500
 That started from the Buddha Shakyamilyam.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:37.500
 That purified and removed the thirsting of the sentient those beings who were connected,

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.500
 and fulfilled their need and goal, and that continually started, and until now.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.500
 And now we try to keep that lineage, that light, that chain,

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.500
 the golden chain, in teaching you stainless golden chain.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.500
 We try to keep up that. So I give this last mission.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.500
 Then also I give some instructions during those empowerment,

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.300
 but I go into more details tomorrow of this particular cycle, the short cycle in which we have that

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.500
.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.500
 Now I'm going to give, and this is last mission, and whenever you know, few of you don't know,

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.500
 I'm just going to read this. Please, as I received this last mission,

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.500
 and that is not just only that, it turns out to be the Buddha, as they did.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.500
 So it's like, in a way, even though it's now my voice,

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.500
 but it's the continuing voice of those Buddhas, and God of God of God.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.500
 That I will read in a way, which is not the bottom of the record,

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.500
 and let us play you to that. In a way, that is kind of the idea.
