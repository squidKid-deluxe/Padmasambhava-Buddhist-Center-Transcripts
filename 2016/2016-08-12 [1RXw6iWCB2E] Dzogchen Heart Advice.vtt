00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.390
 "When we are practicing the purva of awareness, when that really becomes good, what is the sign?

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:16.740
 How do you know that your practice is really good at the purva of awareness?"

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:28.190
 He said, "A sign of the realization of the purva of awareness or a sign of fulfillment of the purva

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:35.640
 of awareness is removing or releasing all the dualities."

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:43.870
 That means we are not caught by the dualities. Purva is in the duality thoughts, almost caking us,

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:51.920
 the electrons, every time, particularly there is two emotions, two graspings, every kind of ruff

00:00:51.920 --> 00:01:03.250
ling, summarized, good grasping and bad grasping, or healthy grasping and unhealthy grasping, and

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.020
 healthy grasping is what?

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:14.410
 Loving kindness, compassion, joy and appreciation, those are known as good grasping. What are those

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:20.620
 also named in the Buddha teaching? Relative truths. Relative truths they are.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:31.360
 What is unhealthy grasping is anger, attachment, grasping, clings, and a combination of their

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:40.410
 movements. Why is it named unhealthy? Whenever we have that, it is arising that energy in our

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.620
 mental state and the channel is the wind.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:55.880
 That individually, our self in shaky and double steps. And when you project that externally, it

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:06.870
 brings again similar shaking and uncomfortable and bad vibration, and then it again could bring

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.620
 bigger as suffering.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:20.610
 Therefore, it is called unhealthiness. And this is what we have to release. We have to liberate it.

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:34.680
 If we are not caught by the negative emotions, as we said in the Jyotji teaching, when you

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.620
 liberated that,

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:48.160
 where? To the dharma, that or within the space of the awareness. Where it comes from? It is the

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:55.940
 space of awareness, or rupa, that awareness of rupa. It came from rupa, it is lingering in the rupa

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.620
 status or awareness status.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:06.770
 You transcend that into rupa status. It has no any obstacles, no effort at all. What the great

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:12.620
 master used example, as entering the rubble in the empty house.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:22.780
 In empty house, rubble entered. There is nothing to lose, nothing to gain, can and gone, or blowing

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.620
 the wind in the empty house or rooms. Like that.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:35.640
 If we are able to liberate it, it has no effect at all. Not only on the negative level, but it has

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.620
 great positive energy when you liberate it.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:46.300
 You activate it, you restenstain it, you understand the realisation. At the same time, we have

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.620
 purified the habitus, that much.

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:56.300
 We have purified it. We are cleansing it. We remove the obscurations. That is how the practice does

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.620
. Do continue. Liberty. That is the one.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:10.160
 But so here, see, all the duality conceptions are liberated within the state of the true natural in

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.620
 the dharma dhatu or that awareness status.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:22.970
 When you have that, a capability. Our awareness of rupa is working. Rupa is working, you are really

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.620
, or we are good practitioners. You are practicing.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:33.300
 Now, if we continue to practice that, the preview will bring more perfect and perfect. Practice

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.620
 makes perfect. Practice will continually make perfect and perfect and good.

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:46.640
 If so, however, if we couldn't succeed that realisation of the awareness of rupa, what is the

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.620
 teaching said here? Here is it.

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:56.620
 See, then delusion is continued. There is nothing that stops. It is continuous.

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:05.280
 The air torque, then, restain it, reactivate it, gain the confidence on the root of the profile of

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.620
 the awareness, and be in that status.

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:14.880
 To bring those all realisation and token there, as he said yesterday, again, great master, he is

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.620
 only doing it with highlighted.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:25.460
 Those four trainings of the mind, all four, renounce as your thoughts. Then devotion. Second is

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:26.620
 devotion.

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:34.620
 Devotion to the lineage, devotion to the teaching, to the lineage, and to teacher, to yourself.

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:41.820
 All teaching is precious. What is devotion? Devotion is the combination of joy, appreciation, and

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:42.620
 confidence.

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.620
 You should feel great joy in them. I happen to hear you.

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:52.990
 With all the devotions, actually in the teaching centre, with all the devotion, relaxation won't

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.620
 drown.

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:59.620
 I said so many times to you, and you all know, it is not just something I am talking new things.

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:03.620
 I am just reminding you to ask us.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.620
 For that reason, Vadakshaktamuni said it so many times.

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:12.620
 Study is good, contemplation is good, but when it comes to the practice,

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:18.620
 it led to bring the realisation of the meditation, the practices, devotion is the instrumentals.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.620
 Read life through all those great masters.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:28.130
 For example, with the devotions, when you have the devotions, there is not particularly really

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:29.620
 something facing needed.

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:38.930
 Simple movement, simple gesture, looks so mundane, but it breaks completely, bursts up the real

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:39.620
isation,

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:45.620
 immediately, or it opens the window of the realisation, instantly, exactly as it is.

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:52.620
 This, for example, during the Buddha's time, all those great arahas, one after another,

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.620
 they got the realisation because of their devotions.

00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:02.160
 Devotions, and of course, perfect teachers such as Buddha, and perfect disciples as those great a

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:02.620
rahas,

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:08.980
 and the timing is perfect, their devotion is so strong, and therefore, it bursts up that instant

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:10.620
 realisation.

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:14.620
 For example, in the teachings, Shari Potarvani came.

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:22.620
 Shari Potarvani was one of the great thinkers, great learned masters before he met Buddha.

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:28.620
 Buddha, he was very familiar, he had more than five students, five, so many, five hundred students.

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:34.620
 His teaching, knowledge, all the ancient cultures, he knows so many things,

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:39.620
 but still he can feel he is missing something, really not completely satisfied.

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:43.620
 He left to search, spiritually search, actively.

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:51.620
 But when he met the Buddha, far distance, in a way, not far, but not too close, far distance,

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:58.620
 and Shari Potarvani pronounced it loudly when he saw our joy in the happy.

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:06.620
 He pronounced it, said, said, said, "You are my teacher, teacher."

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:13.620
 And then Buddha extended his right arm, "Yes, Shari Potarvani, come to me."

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:24.730
 When Buddha said, "Yes, yes, Shari Potarvani, come to me," that word completely broke the shell of

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:25.620
 the dualities.

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:31.620
 He become instantly our others in the teachings, instantly our others.

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:39.620
 At that moment, remove all the obscurations, dualities become our others.

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:47.620
 Then similarly, Mahakajyapas, also similarly, Mahakajyapas.

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:50.620
 I mean, Mahakajyapas was one of the great that time.

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:56.620
 Of course, he was very learned, but one of the richest person or son in the family,

00:08:56.620 --> 00:09:03.620
 or in India that time, according to the teachings, so rich, so rich, the family.

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:08.620
 But at the end, he liked to follow the Buddha.

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:14.620
 So Buddha was known as the Boman Chauting, Stupa Veda, the Stupa Veda,

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:18.620
 in India somewhere, in the eastern central India somewhere, Boman Chauting.

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:21.620
 But the Buddha was sitting there with many disciples.

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:27.620
 Mahakajyapas came again, far away, and closed toward him.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:37.620
 And when he can hear each other's, "Oh great teacher, you are my teacher," he said, again.

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:42.620
 And Buddha said, "Yes, I am your teacher."

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:54.620
 That word, that's the exchanging word, word, completely Mahakajyapas become our other states.

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:57.620
 He didn't got to realize the same as Hariputta.

00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:00.620
 These are just examples of that.

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:08.660
 Examples, all those great ahadas, one after another, they are all achieved because of their dev

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:09.620
otions.

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:12.620
 And for that reason, Buddha Shakyamali said in the teaching,

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:18.620
 "Oh, Hariputta, realization must come through the devotions."

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:19.620
 Devotions.

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:21.620
 Buddha is a great thinker.

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:25.620
 Buddha is a great analytics, analytics, and analytics.

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:30.620
 He is the super-duper analytic person, according to his story, truly.

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:33.620
 That is not just a believing, believing.

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:39.620
 But when you come to the realization, you have to have the devotions.

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:42.620
 That only settles in the heart.

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.620
 That's only merged heart.

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:47.620
 Otherwise, it's like bubbles in the brain.

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:50.620
 It's just a moving cloud in the space.

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:52.620
 It's not really observed.

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:56.620
 Then read the life story of the great Master Thilop, for example.

00:10:56.620 --> 00:11:00.620
 I said so many times, and K.G. Ramonji said so many times,

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:03.620
 but Master Thilop was one of the great,

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:08.620
 Surya Master Naropa is one of the great scholars in that time,

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:12.620
 or in the whole time, one of the greatest scholars, antileptists.

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:17.620
 But again, that's not enough to get the realization.

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:21.620
 Knowing Buddha's teaching in Thile is very special and beautiful.

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:23.620
 It's very benefited.

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:26.620
 But really, realization, when I like to make the teaching,

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:28.620
 you have to have devotions.

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:30.620
 In contact with his Master Thilop,

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:34.620
 for so many years, with so many hardships,

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:38.620
 there were always like twenty-four big hardships

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:41.620
 and twenty-four small hardships.

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:42.620
 He went through that.

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:45.620
 But during those times, his devotion and confidence

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:49.620
 and appreciation to his Master Thilop was never lingering,

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:51.620
 never wavering.

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:53.620
 Wavering, he continued.

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:57.620
 Pine about what is what he received.

00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:03.620
 Thilop banged with his pants, with his slippers.

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:05.620
 Slippers.

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:08.620
 And he felt unconsciousness.

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:11.620
 When he woke up from that unconsciousness,

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:13.620
 he got everything.

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:17.620
 It looks like a building sky, morning sun shines.

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:18.620
 His medicine.

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:21.620
 He became the great Master Narapas.

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:23.620
 So this is one after another.

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:25.620
 It's just all this.

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.620
 And then I will tell one story again.

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:30.620
 Stories, this is again paparumujis,

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:32.620
 great Master paparumujis.

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:34.620
 We heard so many times.

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:36.620
 And he has, of course, so many students.

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:38.620
 So many students.

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:41.620
 One of the students is known as Jyotir Lumto.

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:43.620
 Lumto is very famous.

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:46.620
 He was the root teacher of the kyempo makchung.

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:49.620
 The reason they published a beautiful life story

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:52.620
 of the magic of dance, I think.

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:53.620
 Dance with it.

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:56.620
 He was one of the great Masters.

00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:59.620
 Jyotir Lumto and the kyempo makchung.

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:01.620
 Kyempo makchung is in a teaching set,

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:02.620
 or many great Masters set.

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:06.620
 He is the emanation of Vimalamathas.

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:09.620
 Vimalamathara promised that when he came,

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:11.620
 he promised to cancel that thing.

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:14.620
 And his students, "I will come every 100 years

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:17.620
 to re-correct and re-stand the Doki teachings."

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:19.620
 Doki teachings.

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:23.620
 And that is also Master paparumujis set

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:25.620
 to Jyotir Lumto,

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:29.620
 which is one of his foremost disciples.

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:32.620
 He said, "A cold and the calculation," he said,

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:36.620
 "A cold and the calculation is about to come,

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:38.620
 the emanation of Vimalamathara,

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:43.620
 but I don't see the emanation of Vimalamathara.

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:48.620
 Maybe you will see the emanation of Vimalamathas,

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:50.620
 great Master Vimalamathas."

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:55.620
 So as his kind of like that mad statement

00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:58.620
 or kind of presumption, what's called this kind of like,

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:01.620
 not sure, but it's just he made that statement,

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:04.620
 then accorded it, I mean not accorded it,

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:07.620
 then the kyempo makchung was born,

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:10.620
 me paparumuj, great Master paparumujis

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:12.620
 entered Mahapara in Iran.

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:14.620
 So kyempo makchung was really renowned

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:17.620
 as the emanation of Vimalamathas.

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:22.620
 So but anyway, I'm talking about the paparumujis

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:27.620
 and he's one of the foremost disciples of Jyotir Lumto.

00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:32.620
 Jyotir Lumto been as a student for many years,

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:37.620
 so many years in the teaching said, "I'm never over 20 years."

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:40.620
 And during that time, I mean he's very old

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:43.620
 and he's also vast expert knowledge,

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:45.620
 all the teachings and all that.

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:50.620
 And one time, and then he has such a strong devotion,

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:53.620
 of course, to the Master paparumujis all the time.

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:58.620
 He becomes a personal attendant to the paparumujis.

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:02.620
 And then one time in the nighttime,

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:04.620
 many times paparumujis, of course,

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:08.620
 they all stay in hermitage in the remote areas.

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:12.620
 And paparumujis, many times in the teaching said,

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:15.620
 he lay down on the nighttime,

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:19.620
 and lay down on the ground and looking to the sky,

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:22.620
 as known as the beretari on the skies,

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:25.620
 or the three sky practices,

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:28.620
 or three spacious practices, beretari.

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:32.620
 So his paparumujis are doing that, doing that.

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:36.620
 At that time, also, new few Lumto was there, came there.

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:40.620
 At that time, what paparumujis said,

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:44.620
 he said, "Come here with me, lay down here."

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:48.620
 "Here, you always make it very difficult to recognize

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:51.620
 the nature of the mind, lay down here."

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:53.620
 And when they lay down,

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:56.620
 both are laying down, looking to the sky,

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:58.620
 and the stars are getting there.

00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:01.620
 Then the paparumujis said,

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:05.620
 "Can you hear the noise of the drop from Zoki Monastery?

00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:09.620
 Can you see the sky and the stars?"

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:13.620
 We master paparumujis said that.

00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:16.620
 That simple, ordinary world,

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:18.620
 the great new few Lumto,

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:24.620
 woke up and said, "That moment, he really got the realization, completely."

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:27.620
 Before, there were so many teachings, all that,

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:30.620
 but it's very difficult to get the realization,

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:34.620
 but that moment, he completely woke up his realization,

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:38.620
 completely clear, brilliant sky,

00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:41.620
 dawned in his heart and mind.

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:45.620
 So realization is, we have the devotion,

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:48.620
 the strong, realization comes.

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:51.620
 Of course, what do you understand in knowledge,

00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:53.620
 all that really built up,

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:55.620
 all that built up, that energy,

00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:57.620
 it's come to build up.

00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:01.620
 But finally, to push up that, it's simple, those hopes.

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:06.620
 This is also another story by the great Master Mohoramud, for example.

00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:10.620
 Mohoramudji is one of the great masters in all Buddhist history

00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:13.620
 and scholarship, great scholars.

00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:17.620
 But his root teacher was first, he gets great in chancing,

00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:19.620
 great in chancing.

00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:22.620
 Bhema Osam Dhamalama is one of the very, again,

00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:24.620
 famous master in all time.

00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:26.620
 Many times in the teaching in history,

00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:28.620
 all those great masters, you see,

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:31.620
 Bhema Osam Dhamalama, the first in chancing,

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:35.620
 post-Kundra, they involved this entirely Buddhist teaching

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:38.620
 and all the masters.

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:41.620
 Really, you see, it's just so wonderful, so amazing.

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:44.620
 So when you read a life story, when you heard the story,

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:47.620
 they're not too far away, about a hundred years ago,

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:49.620
 a little over a hundred years ago, whatever.

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:52.620
 When you heard the story, it's just, "Wow, how that is."

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:56.620
 But yet, how they're humble, how they're simple,

00:17:56.620 --> 00:18:01.620
 how they have the devotion and respect to each other and all the beings,

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:03.620
 that is just amazing.

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:08.620
 But however, again, it's first, chancing, chancing.

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:13.620
 So a student, and one time, I'm sure many times Maharan would met him,

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:17.620
 but one time, they're discussing about the practices.

00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:22.620
 One time, Master Chintze, Granny Chintze asked Maharan,

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:26.620
 "How is your practice coming, or meditations coming?"

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:28.620
 And he said, Maharan would answer,

00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:31.620
 "Yes, I'm really trying to do the very best.

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:39.620
 I've ever recited mantras, meditations, every time I make kind of very disciplined

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:42.620
 and very kind of like to make strong,

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:46.620
 so I'm making really big effort and practice in that."

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:51.620
 And then, when his Maharan would say that, and Master Granny Chintze would say,

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:53.620
 "Oh, that's good, that's good."

00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:57.620
 But I, in the lung team, was teaching.

00:18:57.620 --> 00:19:02.620
 The lung team was teaching, "Relax, and be as it is."

00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:06.620
 They said that in the teaching, and I did that.

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:09.620
 I did that by doing that.

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:13.620
 I completely realized it exactly with nature as it is.

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:16.620
 So he kind of casually said that.

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:23.620
 That becomes the big, waking God, God, to Maharan would teach himself.

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:28.620
 In exactly the same way, practices then actualize.

00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:31.620
 Again, because of the power of devotion,

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:35.620
 and all his practice and meditation are built up,

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:38.620
 that realization and point is open the shell.

00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:41.620
 It opens the sky windows.

00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:42.620
 Completely that.

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:44.620
 So those are really there.

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:50.620
 So therefore, devotion is very important really for training the mind

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:58.620
 and both each other and the affection and the loving kindness

00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:00.620
 to the Sangha members.

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:04.620
 Then the brother and sister of the Sangha members,

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:11.620
 those are the poor treasure and wealth of the practitioners as he said.
