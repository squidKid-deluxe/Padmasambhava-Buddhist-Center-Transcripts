 Good things to you, and your family, and your friend.

 That's what I want.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.520
 And this last year or the ending year is one of very kind of challenge day and

 hope this next year, the coming year, the new year will be more smooth and

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.480
 nice and good that I really wish and I pray.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.880
