00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.960
 Then there is no meditations. Always in the teaching I say that when we mix up the wound, that will

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:13.380
 mix up the meditations, and that will mix up also our conduct which will be carrying the med

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.000
itations, and then the result will be deleted.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 So therefore, the wound is so important.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:30.600
 The first is a wound. Here too, in this Sherik Dorje Numentantra also really explains how the wound

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.000
 is forced.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 Here what the great Samyantabar Buddha said here.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:49.090
 First he said, "Dissented all the creating monach as the sovereign of your three doors." That's a

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:58.000
 translate. That means now we have to explore what is wound.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 And that's now when we establish the wound, that is, there are two ways to establish the wound.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:20.520
 An analytic way of establishing. Even this teaching is very, very direct, very kind of

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:27.000
 straightforward, easy way to approach the wound.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 But still we need analytic, analyzing. Therefore he said, "Tak" means descending, discern.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:51.080
 It means exactly, discern. You have to discern. Who is going to discern? Our mind is going to

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.000
 discern.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 Because I often said, and it's true, this practice meditation of the wound is not believing.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:10.240
 Believing. You're going to really find, find and exaggerate things. So you have some trust. We need

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.000
 trust.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 This trust is not, "Oh, I trust, I believe." This is not believing trust.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 This is trust we develop by discern or analyzing. That is what we need.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 So now here, he said, he analyzed within three doors. Three doors.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:48.860
 Because, all created monarchs, all created monarchs, so that means all created monarchs and as well

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.000
 as three doors we're going to examine.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 And what is it all created, all created monarchs? It's synonym for the mind. Mind is all created.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:19.290
 He said, "No one is according Buddhism, creators, except our mind. Each of our mind is created in

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.000
 each of our environments."

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:33.910
 Our mind is everything. It really is. And that's it. Many times we heard. You heard. And also I

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.000
 make it many times.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.910
 But the teaching says so clearly, so clearly everywhere. And particularly from the mind only

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:51.910
 schools, Mahayana school, all the way to Vaidyana teaching, there is no difference. Mind created

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.000
 everything. Mind created everything.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:02.790
 So clearly, I can't say that this thing by great master Mookima. What he said. He said, "The origin

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.000
 and nature of the mind is luminosity, status.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:18.980
 It's the tathaga, the garba. It's clay, view, pristine, brilliant, openness. But then our ignorance

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:25.000
 almost hindered our display of the nature.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:33.050
 Then we started grasping and clinging. Then all the habit patterns developed. Those habit patterns

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.000
 are three different habit patterns.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:44.520
 Habit pattern of the universe, habit pattern of the usage, habit pattern of each of our bodies, all

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:54.000
 object and subject and our consciousness, all that habit patterns developed.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:03.240
 And then it's okay. It's like the rims. Everything developed. One up and up. So this is reality.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.000
 Reality really is not something that existed.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 Solid. Solid existed. But illusory is existed. And for that reason, again great master Mookima said

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.000
,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:25.030
 "Even though they are not truly existing, but through the delusion of the ignorance, appearing

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:30.000
 those are magically at interdependent levels."

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:39.340
 Interdependent. They're not going just one, only one course. So many factors, so many causes are

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:45.000
 arising those, even though they are not exactly reality.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.060
 It's called, that's what Iraq is called, supporting each other, that magical is called, inter

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.000
dependent coordination.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 And how long it is lost? Again great master Mookima said, "It will last until duality is ended."

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 Each of our dualities ended. As long as we have the duality, that much long we have the karma.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:24.210
 We have all these good and bad things. For that reason, we always careful, thoughtful with our

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:28.000
 karma, our activities.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 Those are really in the teaching by great master Mookima said.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 So this is, now the mind creates everything. So mind is the principle. Mind is the principle.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 And now we think, now we think, so let's go somewhere. And I'm sure it's put not here.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 We put nice put nots there, but many of you know already I'm there, go somewhere.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 But I tell again, there's three doors. Three doors are the body, speech, and the mind.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:11.720
 Those are the verbal, those are in Buddhism three doors. Why is called door or why is metaphor door

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:12.000
?

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 Because these three are the entrance of the good and bad, bad things.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:28.610
 Or good karma, bad karma, and neutral is coming through this. Therefore, it is named as three doors

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:29.000
.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:48.000
 So now we think of this. Mind is the principle. Mind is the here, see.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:58.880
 Monarch as sovereign, sovereign or the king, or queen. Mind is the bubbles. And mind is ruling the

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:01.000
 three doors.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 Mind is ruling the mind. Mind is ruling the speech. Mind is ruling the body.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 So now really mind is everything. And mind as take the credentials as mind create everything,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 environment everything.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:26.280
 So now this, when we doing this, this is called very simple way and a life way. So where is this

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.000
 mind?

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 That's what the example. We always think our mind is with us. It's true. Our mind is with us.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 Each of our mind is with us. So where is our mind? Mind.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 This mind share with us, with body. Body and mind are same. Speech and verbal and mind are same.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:04.530
 What is this? Mind is where? If body and mind are same, that cannot be because we didn't have this

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:05.000
 body.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:15.420
 A border is our edge. We didn't have the body about seven years ago, or ten years ago, probably

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:16.000
 years ago.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:22.000
 So where is mind? Mind. So that means mind and body are not same.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:31.000
 So now mind is residing, roughly we think mind is residing in the body. But where is really now?

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:39.000
 Now we're looking carefully. This is the endless getting by ourself, by our own intelligence.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 So take, look, where is mind? Mind, from top of our head all the way to our feet. Where is mind?

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 Trying really big point. Exactly. And many times, of course, we say our mind is in the brain.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:09.000
 And many times also in Buddhism, say it in the heart. But where? Where it is?

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:18.000
 And if there's really a mind in the brain, I'm sure it's more scientific or laboratory, well, fine.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 But nobody sees anything they say. And then in the heart also there's nothing we can find.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:35.000
 So mind is really not at all in a way. But yet we have the mind. Is the mind outside the body? No.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:43.000
 Even in that we won't believe. So inside some way have to be. But it's not there.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:51.000
 So that means mind is not really with the body exactly. Its location is free.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:11:00.820
 Place is absence of the mind in any of those, in a way. So that is, so this means mind and body are

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:02.000
 not same.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 Then we think of our verbal communication, verbal speeches. Where is our mind?

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:18.400
 Where are we talking? With this sound? With that? And which part? If the sound we can find, sound

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:19.000
 is going out.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:25.000
 Sound can be recorded. Is the mind can be recorded? No. I don't understand.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:32.570
 So this is a true Emma's gathering. It's not just a believing. We're trying to really find a fact,

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:34.000
 exactly as it is.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:42.000
 So mind is not the same with the verbal. So then now where is this mind?

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:48.000
 Now among these three things, boarding, speech, mind, sit.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:56.000
 So we analyze, really, those are many times you can analyze in many different ways.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:03.410
 The teachings explain in so detail and so thoroughly, all part of the body is with bone, it has

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:04.000
 muscles.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 Our mind is with bone, with muscle, with blood, with flake, with skin. And each of those is not.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:21.560
 Really mind is lovely. And that way, also examined in the Madhavaka teachings, for example, ego-cle

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:22.000
aning.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:29.830
 We can say ego is something so important. That's the principle. Where is that "I"? That's something

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:30.000
.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:40.250
 It's not anywhere. Same way we analyze the mind. There is no "I" at all or ego we can find, any

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:41.000
 places.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:50.000
 Out, in, any place. So that is the, we said, we established the emptiness of the mind in the body.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 And then we also analyze with the speech. And then we live down, find the speech is free from mind.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 There is no one. It's completely different. It's not the mind and the speech are the same.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.750
 The body and the speech are the same. The body and the mind are the same. It's completely different

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:13.000
.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:23.610
 Now, then where is the mind? Now we single out the mind. Mind. So then we find the mind out. Where

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:25.000
 is the mind?

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 Those are then in the teaching here, explaining more, more, more, and then we can go tomorrow too.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 We continue now. But this is called establishing the will. Establishing the will, that means

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 establishing,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 exactly where things are. That means you're establishing, trusting and bringing knowledge up,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:57.000
 but exactly where things are, where things. At this time, we're going to meditate with the mind,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
 the nature of the mind.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 So therefore, it's so important. And also according to the teaching, the mind is everything.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 When we discover, when we uproot the mind, mind, we're almost uprooting samsara too.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 Samsara is the one. And if we really, truly uproot the mind, we're uprooting all the emotions.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:33.000
 Anger, and jealous, heavy, told, all those we are uprooting. And for that reason,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 the great master, Shabhwa Swaroora, knew he said that. He said, if you like to cut the tree,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 cutting leaves and the limbs and the branches, that is not going to work.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 If you cut the tree from the root, it will destroy everything. All the leaves and the branches,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000
 everything will be gone.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 Similarly, mind is the root of everything. Therefore, we are uprooting.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 We're establishing the true will, will from the mind. Then it's a display.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:12.640
 When you are establishing that quality, then it's a display of the mind and display for every

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:13.000
 environment.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:19.000
 Then it's empty, empty too. But yet, of course, it's not going to,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 it's not going to stop functioning or doing things. It's not going to stop at all.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 But we see the magic display of the way things are. Things are.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 So that is really my talk.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:49.480
 So then there are more details here now. When we separate it from the mind, from the three doors of

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:50.000
 the body and the rubble,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:57.000
 and then more examining from the mind here, more explaining here, so then we go to more.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
 Thank you everyone again.
