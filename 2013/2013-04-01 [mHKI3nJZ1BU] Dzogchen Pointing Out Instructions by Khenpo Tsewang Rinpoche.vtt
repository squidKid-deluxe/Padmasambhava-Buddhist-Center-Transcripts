00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.880
 "When you meditate, for example, what we meditate now, we meditate looking direct to our own mind,

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.000
 looking to our own mind.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:24.060
 And to usher in or to do this, we can put even questions as going questions. As I said, where is my

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.000
 mind?"

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 Simple that point question will take us to the Dharmakaya status.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 Then when we reach that, when we got that, we have to relax. That openness status, we should relax,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 we should meditate.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.140
 When we meditate on that status, then thought will come. And that's what I also in Dzogchen

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.000
 teaching pointed out.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 It's called poem emptiness is home. Or poem is emptiness, emptiness is home. That's.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 But don't try to fall. Don't analyze that. Again, back to that, what way is my mind?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:19.430
 That's going to lead us. Stay in that person. That is fresh, that is present, and that is then in D

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.000
zogchen teaching also said pre-prompt three times.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:33.310
 Past time, future time, present time is a fresh status. It's not time of the conceptual level. It

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.000
 is therefore more time status.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:45.420
 And during that relaxing time, as I said, also occasionally bring up more joy, more devotions, more

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.000
 appreciations.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:55.650
 How lucky I am, how fortunate I am, how blessed I am, how beautiful I am. Bring up those old

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.000
 beautiful qualities.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.970
 We are practicing dharma. We are practicing our goodness. We are not practicing sad and suffering,

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.000
 these and that things.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 We are practicing good. Let that goodness, energy, despair, transcendence, all our mundane,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 difficult troubles that I gave.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 We are going to walk in a reverent trail of our, this beautiful trail.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.020
 What the great Master Maumu said, this original nature, dharma kaya vayri of revere, sambhu kaya v

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.000
ayri revere, namakaya vayri revere.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 How wonderful, how lucky, how fortunate, how beautiful, how grateful, how graceful.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 Such teachings are existing. Buddha came, teaching existed.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 Madhupeyama sambhu came. Gomkimva came. Marambhurya came.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 All those teachings, beautiful teachings, preserving, we are truly connected.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 We are the holder of this lineage, lineage of love, lineage of completion.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 Bring up those kind of, I'm not taking all those things, but bring up those joy and appreciation.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 And again, same time, looking back to the mind. Where those are coming, that port is coming.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:26.910
 Again, this all went, went back to the center of that precious dharma kaya and relaxed and med

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.000
itated.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 And that's relaxing, that state is known as meditating, that.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 So those are the, teaching said, so this is again one of our great opportunity.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.520
 We all have been talking about support to each other, inspiring to each other, according to our

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.000
 capabilities and practice.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 That is just a meaningful and so special. And also this facility and the beautiful environment,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 everything.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.100
 And this also great country which has not any troubles of externally what happened in the world

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.000
 that we see.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 And also wonderful, how beautiful, everything. So really it's just, it means to be like this.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:11.040
 We should be joined up and then dedicated that merit and the goodness for all our beings and all

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.000
 those who are connected to us.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.810
 And then make this offering to the great lineage masters of teachings and then again continue to

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.000
 move forward.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 So this is all wonderful and thank you, okay.
