00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.800
 [APPLAUSE]

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.760
 Thank you again. Good evening, everyone, and welcome. Thank you.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.600
 Thank you for giving me this opportunity to be with you this evening and discussing the teaching

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:32.640
 of those great masters, masters. So I'm very honored and privileged, again, to give this

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.680
 opportunity to organize this event by the Summer Buddhism Centers here in West Palm Beach,

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:46.080
 and then as well as the unitary church. It's always been so kind, asked to host here so many

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:52.050
 years, one after another. I have so many beautiful memories in these places, again and again. So I

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:52.160
'm

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:58.640
 so thankful to all members of the unitary church, and it is board members, and as well as the

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:58.960
 Summer

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:06.240
 Buddhism Centers and members of this organization and the friends of everyone. So I'm so thankful

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:13.040
 again. Thank you again. And tonight, I'm going to talk, as you already mentioned, about the

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.440
 teaching,

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:22.240
 the words of the wisdom that shared by many those great ancient masters. They practice and meditate

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.240
.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:29.440
 This ancient wisdom's knowledge is not something that has been ancient and cannot use modern times.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:35.920
 The needs of the living human beings are always similar. There's nothing really much changed.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:43.360
 Of course, externally, technology, there's a lot of change. The need of a human being is nothing

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:51.040
 changed as from the ancient time and now. The words of the wisdom and the great experience,

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:59.120
 the advice that continue from those elders, one after another, is always applied. Can we apply?

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:05.760
 That it really makes our life so comfortable, beautiful. In our life, of course, there's so

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:12.880
 many we go through, so many things like challenge or the experience that we go through. So many

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:13.440
 times,

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.840
 in one way, there's a lot of challenge. It's difficult, but otherwise, they're also experiencing.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:26.160
 It's just going through different scenic roads of the different of our lives, and we can also

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.160
 bring better understanding why we're standing, what we're going to do, and what will be our

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:38.480
 future, how we're going to handle it in our future. So this is what this great ancient, these

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.400
 elders, these teachers who really also, not just they're talking that, but they also

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.920
 give these instructions, and they practice, and they actualize. And when we lead lives

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:56.560
 over those ancient, the great elders, they're so happy. They're so full of joy and peace,

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:03.120
 and yet their love and kindness and compassion is just so overwhelming, radiating as sunlight

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:10.000
 without clothes or the dust is shining everywhere all the time. They illuminate their self with

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.240
 love

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:16.640
 and joy and great fulfillment, and they share that knowledge to the others. And others are also

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:22.400
 practiced with great, these beautiful ways. So this is what really, this something, knowledge,

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.480
 is so important. No matter how much modern technology externally developed, as I said,

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:34.640
 need of the human being is very similar. Nothing changed, nothing changed. So therefore,

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:41.520
 this, the world, the wisdom, this great instruction, so we can apply it every moment, every time

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:47.440
 in our life, so that life will become more meaningful, life will become more rewarding to us,

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.480
 and life will become more legacy and beautiful so that we can make something that beautiful,

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:58.640
 homely, nice to ourselves, our family members, and the neighbors, and the countries, you know,

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:04.960
 to everyone. And this, so that's what this really great world of wisdom is. Now this world of

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:11.440
 wisdom can be, in ancient times, kind of summarize those great masters and these elders into like

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:18.000
 five points. And I'm just going to list those, and then I will go through all of these. Even when I

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.320
 listed those, these points, you will know there's nothing in mystery, any separate things that we

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.480
're

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:30.320
 talking about. We're talking something common ground, common knowledge, common need, common

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:36.720
 nature. But we all share, share, no matter, as I said, no matter whatever color we have,

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:43.200
 whatever language we speak, whatever we kind of like tradition or custom we have, but the design

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:51.520
 and the hope are the very same. We like to be happy, joy, peaceful, and something fulfillment,

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:57.040
 and something kind of rewarded to ourselves that we don't have to be disappointed ourselves when we

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:04.320
 look back to our life, trails of our lives. So this really, these those points will help us to

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.960
 activate

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:12.720
 it, to bring back to our track so that we can stand firmly in our ground and look ahead to our

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:22.480
 future destination and as well as our area and so on. These are five points. First is the joy,

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:31.680
 joy and the appreciations. Second is courage and commitments. And the third is mindfulness.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:41.040
 And the fourth is loving kindness and compassion. And the fifth is relaxing my mind,

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:49.360
 which is often known as meditation. So these are the five different points that really touch to our

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:57.120
 own true naturals. Nature of ourself, this all nature of ourself that what I listed or what these

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:03.680
 great elders are listed and shared are is nothing alien or the strange things that okay or nothing

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:09.600
 has to do also in the religious or the or the schools, these schools, that school. This is our

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:19.040
 basic nature, basic call it ourself, self, your self, my self. And we stand firmly on this ground,

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:27.520
 acknowledging and a reward that these naturals definitely it will make our life so beautiful,

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:35.760
 so calm, so peaceful, so this is what it is. So it's nothing to do anything kind of a different

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:43.120
 tradition or the different systems. It is our naturals. The first is these five points as I said

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:52.880
 you are listed. The first is joy. Joy is what we have good start of ourself. Joy is so important.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:07:01.600
 And without the joy, we cannot actualize anything. And without also recognizing the joy,

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:08.720
 we ignore so many good things. When we look to ourself, our career, our behaving of our mind,

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:14.880
 we are always looking something outside and far always looking more than what we have.

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:24.240
 We don't really glorify, cherish and acknowledge our goodness, our joy and our what situation we

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:32.000
 have. Because ourself, we cannot carry it outside thinking more and more and miss the point.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:40.400
 And therefore, joy is important. We have every reason to be joy. In every situation,

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:47.200
 and many times in Buddhism we called in the samsara level, worldly level, in the spiritual level,

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:53.760
 we have every reason to be joy and appreciate it. In the samsara level or worldly level,

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:59.760
 we are beautiful human beings, beautiful human beings, beautiful intelligence.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:08.000
 Our being as a human being is also not just co-accidental. Co-accidental. It has

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.640
 many cause and conditions, circumstances behind the scenes that maybe we don't see immediately,

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:20.560
 we don't know immediately. But definitely there is so many cause and conditions. Circumstances

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:29.200
 came perfectly to bring out ourself as what we are now. Now, if there is among these so many

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:36.640
 circumstances situation, if one ingredient missed or few ingredients lost, we won't have what we

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:44.160
 are now. We won't have. Our cause is completely changed. But what we are now, look to yourself,

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:52.880
 read yourself how good things you are, how good things I am surrounded. And therefore, joy of

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:58.880
 lives. Do you read that? I am beautiful human beings. I have quite good intelligence. I have good

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:05.840
 knowledge, understanders. Can you feel those? Those are the beginning of the glorifying,

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:13.040
 bringing joy and peace in our lives. Joy is so important, important. Then joy of all the

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:20.080
 certain circumstances such as this country. I always tell to my friends, this country is one

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:28.800
 of the best country on this planet, on Earth. Again, this is what just also happened. So many

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:35.280
 people worked so hard to bring this situation and circumstances. In a way, we are using this fruit

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:43.040
 of all those good deeds of the past. And how wonderful. This is beautiful again. How thankful.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:50.160
 We have gratitude. Bring gracefulness. Bring gracefulness and gratitude is not just spiritual,

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:56.720
 but it is human values and goodness of ourselves. Being grateful, gratitude,

00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:06.000
 graceful. And we do this. I feel joy and being grateful and appreciated. What it brings to us

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:13.920
 people ourselves are more rich. Even though this country and yourself are quite rich in the world,

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:21.760
 but it makes more rich, more heart is rich, not just external material become rich, but it really

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:29.520
 makes heart full of reach and prosperity. And then it brings back peace and calm, happiness.

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:36.320
 This all is started from here with you. It's not just looking outside going these and that

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:43.040
 things. Of course, we can get some support outside these things, but principally is we have to

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:43.360
 start

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:50.000
 ourself. Button is with you. You have to push the button yourself. There's nothing we have to do,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:57.520
 big change and all these things. Bring yourself. Be yourself. Be that in just glorified situation

00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:08.000
 and circumstances, joy, appreciations, being grateful, being grateful, grateful. Those all

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:18.320
 are, makes our life so rich, so beautiful and so special. Not really become life's reach and it's

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:24.640
 happy. It makes also our family more rich, calm and peaceful. Our friends and all those who are

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:31.360
 connected to us really will see the benefit of this joy and appreciation. So this is not something

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:38.960
 that we're doing locally to our own self. Self can be important level. But it brings, opens heart

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:46.720
 and brings more beautiful panoramic understanding view of the vastness of our beauty and our

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:47.600
 richness

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:56.160
 in our self that radiating, lightening and sharing benefit to the others. So therefore, this joy is

00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:05.280
 so important. Joy, I say the joy, appreciation, being grateful, grateful, gratitude, all those

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:12.080
 terminologies, whatever we have to acknowledge. And we look to ourselves many times. Even we are

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:17.520
 surrounded with so many good things, such as friends, family, all these things. We come many

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:23.120
 times looking at something else. We miss the point. When we miss the point and then we kind of

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:23.840
 maybe

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:33.040
 suffer. Said that's a letter too late. We have to now acknowledge. Now is the important. Now will

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:40.720
 change the future. Take all those great ancient elders. You say take ancient activity as your

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:48.160
 experience, learning experience and stand firm with that experience on the now and change the

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:53.680
 direction of the future. They always say that. Those donuts. It's so important. They're so

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:54.720
 practical.

00:12:54.720 --> 00:13:00.000
 It's not something that we have to be something, certain things to be, to do those things. As I

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:09.600
 said, we can be as we are. Nothing changed, but just glorify our self. So that is really about the

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:20.000
 joy and appreciation. Second is this great elder masters. So we said courage, courage and

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:26.400
 commitment. Courage is needed. Even though we are surrounded with all those beautiful things,

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:33.840
 in the samsara, in the world, any minute can change. Change is a continual flowing system

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:43.200
 as rivers. Nothing lasts forever as it is. It is like rollercoaster or it is like moving force.

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:52.240
 Therefore, we need courage. We need commitment to standing firmly on those old changes we go

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:59.680
 through this. We should not lose our principles, our identity of the goodness, courage and

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:05.440
 commitment. And we will become so timid and sensitive. Then everything becomes so bothered.

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:11.600
 Everything is completely kind of like obstacles or the blockage and hindrance. And then we kind of

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:19.680
 like parachute and overthrow by that. But if we have courage and commitment, stand firmly on this

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:27.120
 our identity of goodness. The course we can change. We can change the course. And as I said before,

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:33.360
 many of those elder masters you see, the what we were going through is learning experience,

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:40.080
 changing experience. Use that as changing experience. Learn that as learning experience.

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:49.600
 We be strong, friendly and standing tall in our principles. Also in ourselves, we have the great

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:57.280
 courage. Not being a human being is not just only surviving, but we like to be also benefited to

00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:57.360
 the

00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:06.960
 others. Surviving is everybody does, even animals does. Animals does surviving things. We are

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:14.320
 beautiful, intelligent human beings. We like to be more benefited. Beneficial is the whole mark

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:21.280
 of the good persons, good human beings to benefit it. To start benefited to your families, your

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:27.200
 friends, and then extend the neighbors and country according your readiness and capabilities. But

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:27.360
 we

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:36.080
 have to do benefited. We have to help and support something meaningful ourselves. If we started

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:43.200
 benefiting, helping to the others. Others. You really feel again, same thing. You feel more happy,

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:47.760
 more joy. You're doing something good things. Not just the only kind of trying to

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:53.520
 self-center the local, like the kind of narrow status all the time. That kind of blocks it. That

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:59.680
 kind of like drops us, but every kind of open our heart and arms to the others, trying to let it

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:07.520
 help and support more beneficial, more benefited beings. That is again to do this. We need to let

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:13.280
 a courage. We need to let a commitment. We need to let it be done again, kind of like

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:14.640
 responsibilities.

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:21.920
 And we do this. This is known as then, not just the only kind of like our self to make better,

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:28.240
 but you're really outreaching good quality to the others, others. And that is a wonderful things,

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:34.880
 good things to do, helping, support. We benefited to the others. That is well-brained the

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:42.160
 fulfillment in the lives. You become quite fulfilled. Your quality and your activity,

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:48.480
 your capability is extending. According to the great masters or in the Buddha's teaching said,

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:55.200
 human beings generally have so many talents, so many capabilities. This is ready to come out,

00:16:55.200 --> 00:17:04.560
 but how many times our ego-cling, narrow-minded, almost block that always. You cannot let it come

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:11.360
 out because of this, our habit patterns. But if we're trying to really help and support,

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:17.440
 that brings out of your talent and your skills, your methods to help to the others,

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:24.800
 to others and bring your qualities. You become more than, I mean, whoever did this, we become more

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:33.440
 successful, more powerful, more beneficial, more gentle. Through that, what we call,

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:38.960
 we create the peace and harmonious. You become one of the mission of the peace,

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:44.960
 bring peace and harmony, good things in the world. That not just start from outside,

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:52.320
 start from you, with your gentle courage and commitment and aspirations. So therefore,

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:58.880
 again, all those reasons in this world, there's so many things, different things,

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:04.800
 one after another can happen, changes like running river, and therefore to kind of standing firmly,

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:12.000
 not lost our balance, is courage, courage and commitment with joy and appreciation.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.760
 That is what really so important.

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:27.920
 The next one is then the next point, about mindfulness. Now, what I discuss, I mean,

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:33.680
 I said, it's not just I'm saying I learned these things from these great elder masters.

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:38.400
 They practice, as he said, they're not just a talker talking this, but they really practice it,

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:45.200
 and they share their experience and knowledge for the others. And as also, I kind of try to

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:53.040
 follow with that as much as I can do my capabilities. So with this, first is joy. Again, I said

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:53.280
 that,

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:59.840
 really about the joy. Second is courage and commitment. That also I said really this,

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:08.320
 third is mindfulness. Mindfulness is very important. Mindfulness is not distracted too much,

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:15.280
 not lost the balance. Your awareness, your intelligence, or our awareness, our

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:22.400
 intelligence is kind of like alert state, or is illuminating, or it is lightning status. It's not

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:30.080
 darkness. We don't have the mindfulness. What? We destruct it. We destruct it, and the destructions

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:36.400
 of all the different external destructions of so many busyness, and as well as all this

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:42.000
 kind of activity that brings so many kind of like computations, or so many kind of like

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:48.000
 information to our self, and then we destruct it. In our self, also we then, when that happened,

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:54.320
 inwardly we destruct it with so many different emotions. And emotions are, such as then,

00:19:54.320 --> 00:20:00.480
 all the emotions, such as anger, and kind of like hatred, thought, or kind of like

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:08.320
 unsufficient, unhappiness, unhappiness. I mean, so many emotions are really beginning to disturb

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:14.720
 that. When our mind is completely congested with this, then all these confusion things comes up,

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:20.640
 anxiety, and worry, and then kind of like completely lost our control. For those reasons,

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:28.880
 there's one very renowned teacher known as Shanti Deva. He said, "A very distracted person is

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:29.600
 always

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:37.280
 on the mouth of the emotions." He said, "Mouth of negative emotions." It's true, every kind of like

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:37.280
,

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:43.200
 very distracted, and not have any mindfulnesses, and then we kind of always, the emotions are

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:43.520
 really

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:51.200
 can attract to us easily, and all through that. And therefore, this is with joy, and courage,

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:58.640
 and commitment, mindfulness is very, very important. Mindfulness, as I said, to remember,

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:04.480
 and thinking, kind of more thoughtful, more careful, more thoughtful to our activities,

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:11.760
 activities of our body, our activities, our verbal activities, and mental activities,

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:17.520
 kind of a little bit thoughtful, and how our personal mind is working, because we're always

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:24.880
 looking outside. We hardly look inwardly to our self, and bring calm, and very peaceful,

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:32.160
 and remind only means you can bring calm, and peace, and gentle to yourself.

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:41.120
 And that means we're not completely carried by the outforce, very inwardly, calm, and peaceful,

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:49.760
 and thoughtful, every activities, activities of the body, activities of the verbal, and activities

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:55.600
 of the mind. And what is what? The activities of the body, when we become kind of put in the

00:21:55.600 --> 00:22:03.600
 mindfulness, our activity body become more calm, peaceful, more relaxing systems. And our activity

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:10.800
 of the verbal, verbal, again put in the red spot of the mindfulness, and the speech become more

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:18.000
 polite, more kind, more soft, more gentle, more respectful. All those good things really follow,

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:25.280
 close up. And activities of the mind, when put in the red spot of the mindfulness, then again,

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:32.880
 it become more calm, and peaceful, not carried by so many emotions all the time, kind of really

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:38.240
 settling towards us. And so therefore, this mindfulness, and this very important, together

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:47.360
 with mindfulness, and alertness, or thoughtful, all those are well supported to bring up the joy,

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:54.960
 and courage, it will bring us back to the track where we are going to moving forward. So therefore,

00:22:55.440 --> 00:23:02.240
 mindfulness is very, very important. So this is really about mindfulness. Now I will talk

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:09.760
 really about love and comparisons. Love and comparison is again very important part of the

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:19.600
 nature of our mind. It's nothing again alien, or strange, anything, as everything. Joy is not any

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:26.080
 strange. Courage and commitment is not strange. And mindfulness is nothing strange. It's part of

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:34.320
 our nature of the mind, or our mind. And together with love and comparison is our part of the mind.

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:40.560
 Love and comparison is generally what means love. Love means something to you,

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:49.200
 see everyone so special and beautiful. Thank you. It's okay. Thank you.

00:23:50.160 --> 00:24:01.200
 Sound troubles. Okay. Thank you.

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:17.280
 Love and compassion is again, is many times, is okay.

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:33.200
 Sorry. Oh, I'm sorry. But I think it's okay. No, with this looks like, okay. So

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:38.400
 loving kindness and compassion is one of the principal beautiful qualities of every living

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:46.080
 beings. In the infant, in the Buddha's teaching, the great master came 2,600 years ago. He says,

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:54.080
 love and compassion, the intelligence are the seed of enlightenment, seed of the waking,

00:24:54.080 --> 00:25:01.040
 waking qualities. This love and compassion, intelligence or the wisdom is not kind of

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:07.600
 absence to anyone. So we all have this nature. Every living beings, even this great teacher,

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:15.040
 Buddha said that even the animals have love and compassion, wisdom. No one is out of these

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:22.960
 qualities. But to bring out that is what is so important. Bring out, let that shine. This

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:30.160
 nature is right with us. Nature is not outside. This is all what we talk tonight is not outside.

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:35.280
 We have to go and get from other planet or something have to be reached or something be

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:41.840
 very famous, powerful, any of those things we don't have to be. Nature is really with us. This,

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:48.880
 this all our treasure, your treasure, my treasure. And every bring loving kindness, loving kindness

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:48.880
.

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:56.880
 It would bring what? It will bring all those what I said. It bring mindfulness. It bring

00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:04.400
 bring joy and apprehensions. It will bring also courage and commitment. And therefore this love

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:10.240
 and compassion is so important. I mean it's great. And compassion is too. It also when we have the

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:17.120
 great compassion, it brings joy. Activity of compassion is joyful activities. And it brings

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:23.760
 also is mindfulness. It will bring courage and commitment. And we do activity of compassion,

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:30.960
 you will feel also more like really fulfilling. I'm doing something good. So not just empty handed

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:37.280
 or not doing anything. You feel you're really doing, you are using our beautiful life to something

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:44.160
 good purposes. You in the eye of the Buddha or eye of the holy beings. That you really feel that

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:50.400
 you were doing something good. This is therefore loving kindness and compassion is so important.

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:57.440
 Vastra. And love is again what they always in the teaching you say those great master says what is

00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:05.120
 love? Love is something seeing everyone is good. Everyone is important. Important is true. Everyone

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:15.200
 is so important. Because of others, others I'm here. Here. Because of you, I'm here. For example,

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:23.200
 tonight. Tonight without you, I won't be here tonight. That is this is not just only tonight.

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:29.120
 Everything in the life is kind of is so important. Everyone is so important and so spirituals.

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:37.760
 Without others, we won't grow. We won't develop. We won't be successful folks. And that level is

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:38.080
 also

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:44.320
 so important. Then each and every one is so beautiful. So spiritual. There's just like shining

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:51.680
 stars in the galaxy. Everyone is shimmering, is glowing. It is beautiful things. So many beautiful

00:27:51.680 --> 00:28:00.720
 things. And also because of others, I can grow. I can deepen it. I can really make something better

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:00.720
.

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:08.320
 My self even thinking of my own self without others. How we can do anything. For all those reasons,

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:14.960
 this whole and others are so important. So special and so beautiful. And the love is also known as

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:15.520
 the

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:26.800
 appreciation. Love is seeing beauty in good qualities. And love is so tender. So nice. When

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:33.280
 you have the love and compassion in your heart, your heart becomes more tender, more calm, more

00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:39.520
 peaceful. More also same time. Sensitives, more knowledge. Understandables. Understand not just

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:46.160
 only not knowing anything around us. We become more aware of the old situation. Circumstances.

00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:53.600
 Life with love and compassion remain rich or everyone life makes more rich, more knowledgeable,

00:28:53.600 --> 00:29:00.370
 more understandable. Without the scholars on the world level, we really also can't achieve too much

00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:00.480
.

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:07.840
 In the Dharma level, on the spiritual level, Buddhism always says without the love and

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:13.120
 the compassion, you won't fulfill anything in your realization or the inner development.

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:21.920
 And so therefore, this love is so important. Loving kindness. Then compassion is so important too.

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:28.160
 Compassion is in our life, even though so beautiful, so special, but there's so many different

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:28.640
 changes

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:35.840
 will come. Life is now always the same. Changes. And we all go through a different challenge and

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:44.320
 difficulties. The compassion is a mission to help, to support, to rescue when we are on a challenge

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:51.120
 in a difficult situation. It's an outreaching kind of solution. Help with that. We need this.

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:51.680
 Everyone

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:58.240
 needs compassion. I need compassion. You need compassion. No matter how much powerful by person,

00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:05.600
 they need compassion. They need love. How much strong they are, they need rich and everyone. This

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:11.520
 compassion and loving kindness, without that, human beings of our life become very poor,

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:19.520
 very kind of impoverished and very desperate situations. And love and compassion really makes

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:26.240
 everything so strong, so beautiful. If we combine with joy and appreciation, courage and commitment

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:26.240
,

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:33.360
 mindfulness, then we have every richness of what all we needed. Think this. I'm not just

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:40.320
 talking this ancient, those great elders said these things. We should apply that. Think of our own

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:47.920
 intelligence. Think. It's true or not. It's true. How we can argue with this? This is something so

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:56.000
 special and beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful. Therefore, this love and compassion. Compassion

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:05.840
 is just so spiritual. And in Buddhism, always say how to do practice of loving kindness. They say,

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:12.160
 even the giant, they spray it. They use it as like a cigarette of mantras. Mantra or the cigarette

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:20.550
 zone. They say loving kindness practice. They say, may all living beings have the happiness and

00:31:20.550 --> 00:31:20.880
 cause

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:28.400
 of happiness. May all living beings have the happiness and cause of happiness. Think then

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:36.640
 sincerely in the heart and the mind and say that word. And how powerful. Love is not just like

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:43.840
 localized and narrowly kind of things. Love, let shine love, powerful love, as sunlight to every

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:51.760
 direction without any partiality and without any boundaries. Boundaries. Again, with that,

00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:57.280
 with this thought, we really say that word or that meaning, meaning in our mind.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:08.160
 May all living beings have happiness and then cause of happiness. Think that meaning. How powerful,

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:15.040
 how strong, how spiritual. That has again nothing to do with any religions or this school, that

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:15.600
 school.

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:21.360
 We're talking about the love, the principle value and the principle quality of our very human

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:21.760
 beings.

00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:31.520
 That is what we're talking. Let that shine, not just cross it or not just put the boundaries.

00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:38.960
 Let that shine to every direction, to all living beings. As I said, everyone needs love.

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:47.840
 No matter how much rich you are, how bold or how weak, how powerful, how strong, how renowned you

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:48.080
 are,

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:56.320
 they all need loves. They all need loves. Everyone. So let that shine, let that open.

00:32:56.320 --> 00:33:02.480
 And we do this. What it makes, you know, always those great adults, you see,

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:10.640
 it makes us more stronger, it makes more our sensitives, it makes ourselves more kind of like

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:18.080
 happy. And then also, after all, it makes great healing powers. It heals all the emotional

00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:23.920
 skirt that we have something. Kind of we feel we didn't do this right, that wrongs. Or we have some

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:30.000
 disappointment. Or we have something kind of like regretous or guiltous. Whatever. It will heal

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:30.320
 those.

00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:35.600
 This is not something shadow we're going to keep all the time. We're going to release,

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:40.480
 we're going to remove, bring more sunlight in our heart and mind and move forward.

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:47.120
 Forward. That is what really we need to do. That's what it says. So when we're thinking of that,

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:56.640
 may all living beings have happiness and cause of happiness. Not just only happiness, cause of

00:33:56.640 --> 00:34:02.800
 happiness. When you think that, when you say that, that means that they always say happiness.

00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:10.720
 Happiness is not just a come by go accidentally. Happiness must have cause and condition and

00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:19.120
 circumstances. We're wishing and praying and putting our power of mind forward to bring more

00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:28.080
 restraint of this cause of happiness. This is so divine. There's in many great those ills you see.

00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:36.080
 There's nothing higher divine, more holy than the true love and true compassion. This is the

00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:44.240
 object of venerations. That is right with your heart. Heart. With each of us. Everyone's heart.

00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:50.960
 We'll open it that divine call it. Then we'll open it that holy call it. Not let trapped it by

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:58.160
 the boundaries of the different emotions. Open that. That is what really is so, so powerful,

00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:07.270
 so speak. And then next one. That is really about the loving kindness. Compassion. Again, it's same

00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:07.280
.

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:15.760
 As I said, compassion is a rescue mission of our talent when loved ones having some

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:21.920
 difficulties, troubles. In our, everybody we go to through the challenge is life.

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:28.160
 There's no one exception. Everybody goes different challenges in their lives.

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:35.680
 Those challenges are always sometimes very challenging, very hard and difficult. That is

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:43.600
 the time we need. Need compassion, activator of compassion. It is. It's best upon the love and

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:49.920
 compassion, coming out compassion. Help me. And again in Buddhism, those integrated, they

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:55.200
 join this. This is again is not really when you look, think of this place, nothing to do with

00:35:55.200 --> 00:36:02.240
 Buddhism, this and that things. Think this, how they say this. This is one of the richest country

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:07.840
 on the earth. There's so many multiple cultures and talents. Our border of this country makes

00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:13.600
 so rich and so special. And similarly spiritual, all knowledge, understand this knowledge and

00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:19.600
 skills and techniques. Every brain, the different things and brain kind of put that together. Bring

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:26.480
 ourselves a more better person as we are even better than now. That is what we need. And to do

00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:33.600
 kind of activating our compassion in this, they say, wow, they said, may all living beings, again

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:41.600
 same thing, may all living beings preform suffering and cause of sufferings. That is what they,

00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:41.600
 they

00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:49.920
 really said that. Pay that world meanings, preform suffering and cause of sufferings. We're really

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:58.160
 wishing throughout this time, again as same as of love and kindness. Two things. We like to be free

00:36:58.160 --> 00:36:58.160
,

00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:04.000
 everyone from the suffering, not just only the suffering, but cause of that suffering.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:11.280
 When we go to the challenge of difficulties, it's not just happening by itself or it's just

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:20.080
 coincidental. It has cause, it has conditions, it has circumstances, that kind of sizzling behind

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:27.760
 the scene, maybe many years or for a long time. And then when all come, it erupted and we see the

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:35.520
 consequences of such sufferings. So we like to be removed, that consequences, that cause

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:43.040
 also cleared way. When cause and condition and suffering is cleared way, what will be sufferings?

00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:50.800
 Then suffering is gone. When suffering is gone, what will be? Then happiness, peace, joy.

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:57.920
 And then that is what we call, suffering as a difficulty is gone. What is known as then? In

00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:04.480
 human world, called heaven. Heaven is nothing but pre from the place, pre from the suffering, the

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:12.720
 difficulties. We make everyone free from the suffering and cause of sufferings. That place

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:19.840
 is heaven. Heaven is not that far you have to go. Heaven started right with ourselves.

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:24.560
 That's true. Heaven is not that we have to buy the two way tickets.

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:38.480
 Heaven is right with us. We have every right to bring that heaven as call it. We have the right,

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:43.520
 we have the, we have all the talents and skills and method and everything we have.

00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:51.200
 That is what we have. So this love and compassion is again so important.

00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:57.920
 Without the love and compassion, there is no spirituals. Without the love and compassion,

00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:04.000
 there are no higher growth of the development of our inner development. Without the love and

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:13.200
 compassion, then we will be, but we will become decreasing all our talents and we will be heading

00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:18.800
 to all the difficult stuff. And therefore, this love and compassion is so important.

00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:26.320
 As every levels, it is healing power. It is reward. It makes reach our life. It makes

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:34.480
 happy ourselves, our self, our family, our friend, our neighbor, everyone. Really it brings bond

00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:34.640
 and

00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:41.200
 it makes it a harmony and peace. This all start with this, this. So therefore, this is one of the

00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:46.640
 great qualities of the human beings. And then also when we have that, it brings more calm and

00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:53.680
 peaceful. Immediately result of this calm and peaceful of the mind in our self. So that is

00:39:53.680 --> 00:40:01.920
 really about the loving kindness and compassion. Next one is I'm going to talk really about again

00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:09.200
 as this great elders. You see the meditation, meditations. Meditation is what I discussed

00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:16.960
 so far, what I said. Again, I go back to those points. But those great elders, you see always

00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:27.760
 first is joy and appreciation. Second is courage and commitment. Commitment. And third is

00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:28.880
 mindfulness.

00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:36.160
 And the fourth is loving kindness and compassion. Those all will make, what means meditation?

00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:44.160
 Meditation means calm and peaceful and balance actually. That's really the balance of our mind.

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:50.800
 If we have those first four points, if we do, it will bring our mind calm,

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:58.560
 non-feastful, more relaxed, more harmony, more peaceful. It will break that. But if we have this,

00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:04.560
 with those all beautiful qualities, if we add this meditation, then it will make more

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:13.030
 more, more fulfillment, more successful. And what is meditation? Generally, as I said, and of

00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:13.360
 course,

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:17.920
 many of you know what it is. That's something new things I'm talking that you don't know.

00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:23.200
 We all know these things we're talking. It's meditation means relaxing our mind,

00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:30.800
 relaxing our mind. When we heard the word relaxing our mind, what also it tells us, most of the

00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:31.200
 time

00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:38.160
 we don't relax our mind. We're not relaxing our mind. Where we are running, what are we doing?

00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:44.320
 It's also directly talking more, talking with our mind. We're not relaxing our mind.

00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:53.440
 Mind. So relaxed, not relaxing. Where our mind is going, not relaxing that. Where our mind is going

00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:59.760
 to all the time, to the past memories, or our present kind of thoughts and conceptions,

00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:08.320
 or future our plans. So it is going three territories, all the time. Mind is going all

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:15.440
 the time, three territory. To the past, to the present, and to the future. That is what really

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:21.840
 our mind is doing all the time. If you look carefully to our mind, read your mind. No one

00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:32.480
 is out of the mind. Everybody can read. Read our own mind. Mind. And you read where we used to.

00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:40.400
 It just always mind is wandering to the past, or to the present, from this, all the, all future.

00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:47.360
 That is what really the mind is doing. That means this how many times we did this by mind.

00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:56.240
 This is being doing all the time. Since our, since we're born, we've been doing that.

00:42:57.120 --> 00:43:03.760
 Even a child in babies, in babies, what they call the carriages, I'm sure they're going somewhere.

00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:13.120
 But when they start walking, they're going somewhere. Again, they have their own phenomena,

00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:19.200
 own world. When we're in kindergarten, we're doing the same thing. We have our own territory,

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:27.120
 and that standard, standard levels. We're running our mind. When we're in school, doing the same

00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:33.840
 thing. When we're in high school, we have that standard again. We're a professional business

00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:39.840
 person, or walking career. We're doing the same thing. We've been doing that all the time.

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:50.480
 Mind is never rested. Physically, yes, we do rest sometimes. We say vacation, and break, and all

00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:57.520
 these things. Day off, all these things. But mind never really rested. That you can think. It's not

00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:05.920
 just talking by someone, telling stories. You can ask that if it's true or not. Each of us is true.

00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:12.080
 That is. Then how this mind is going? Again, have you looked? The day we wake up early in the

00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:12.560
 morning,

00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:20.000
 we do go wandering all the time, our journey, daytime phenomena, busy, and all that. All this

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:25.360
 going back and forth. The kind of electric currents in the brain. The mind is going back and forth,

00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:32.480
 all this, and then adding worries. Stressful, overloaded. This is just completely jammed, our

00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:41.360
 brain, with all those topics, and in a way, and then mind becomes tighter, and tighter, and dense,

00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:48.640
 and dense. Even mind is always in the Buddhism, say the emptiness. Empliness, but in a way,

00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:53.520
 we experience, it becomes so heavy, and so tight, and so burdened, burdened things.

00:44:53.520 --> 00:45:00.960
 Then not just only the day we wake up, and until we go to sleep, but in the nighttime, according to

00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:09.520
 Buddhism, always say, unless you went deep sleep, every sleeping light state, our mind is traveling

00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:18.960
 again. This deep sleep mind doesn't work. It kind of stops to that. Otherwise, all the fun is

00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:19.360
 running.

00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:28.560
 So therefore, we need some breath to this our mind. Breath. And the breath is the meditation.

00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:36.880
 Meditation. Relaxing. We are going to relax. We're going to relax with the present status,

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:42.160
 right in our present. We're not going to, that means we're not going to think of the past,

00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:48.640
 all our activities, of the things, or the future, our plans, or even not going to wander in the

00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:56.240
 present. Present all plans, this and that things. We're going to bring our mind one single instant

00:45:56.240 --> 00:46:06.720
 state of our own state, and relax. If you bring mind, not let go to the past, not let go to the

00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:12.800
 future, not wander in the present status, and the mind has completely become singled out,

00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:20.640
 then it becomes stay in that state. Now, when you stay in one single state at the moment,

00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:27.840
 status, mind is not going to stay that, that status. At that time, you're going to put mindfulness

00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:35.680
 again. Mindfulness, you're going to use. Yes. Where to do this meditation? According to tradition,

00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:42.080
 those are kind of experience and structure of those great elder masters, what this is. Past

00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:48.480
 brain, for example, when you sit on the cushion or on the chair, post your brain any more joy,

00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:55.040
 more appreciation. Thankful to everyone. Thankful to your old situation, circumstances,

00:46:55.040 --> 00:47:03.440
 graceful, great. Bring joy to support present joy and appreciation. If you don't know exactly

00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:09.680
 how to do meditation, joy, as I said, the intellectual, the good quality is what you have,

00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:16.400
 or what we have. It's not just accidental. As I said before, it has so many beautiful

00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:24.240
 cause and reason to really bring up this. Have this. It's true. Therefore, thankful joy,

00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:31.040
 thankful, thankful for all our important beings, grateful, gratitude,

00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:40.080
 graceful, and bring joy, joy and relax in that state for a few seconds.

00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:48.480
 Then, now you're going to meditate. After that, now you're not going to even think of joy,

00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:55.680
 any of those things. Just kind of like stop from any thinking thoughts. Think a thought, relax,

00:47:55.680 --> 00:48:04.560
 relax in the present status, and feel the body yourself. It is all balanced. Every nervous

00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:11.840
 system is relaxed in its own natural status. Every energy movement is also relaxed in its

00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:17.920
 own natural state. Kind of keep that message to yourself. My body, muscles, nervous system is

00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:24.080
 relaxed. My energy and everything is now relaxed. I'm going to relax in my breathing calmly,

00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:29.840
 exactly as it is. Nothing changes the breathing level exactly, but keep calm and feasible.

00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:35.600
 Now, mind has become so calm and peaceful, not wondering all those positive qualities

00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:40.720
 of the past, the present, the future, and the relaxed and the present state. Stay calm and

00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:47.520
 peaceful. And we need some gentle assistance to keep that concentration. Use your breathing.

00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:54.080
 Keep the breathing. So, close the mouth. Don't have to close the mouth tightly or in the open,

00:48:54.080 --> 00:49:01.040
 but keep the normal close in the mouth and let gentle or the breathing comes naturally

00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:09.280
 from your nostrils and follow the mind with the breathing. You see the breathing when you go out

00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:19.200
 or exhale, you're aware of the breathing is out or breathe out. When breathing comes in, inhale,

00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:26.000
 also you aware that. So, kind of have the awareness of the breathing's movement and the relaxing.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:31.920
 Follow the mind with that. Try to stay with that. For example, if you have to feel that,

00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:39.120
 five minutes. It really will help us. It will weak our mind, keep the calm and peaceful with

00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:46.320
 that natural status. It will help. Help to bring everything more calm and peaceful. All those

00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:52.880
 tensions, all those stressfuls, all those thought and busyness is just completely subside. You

00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:53.280
 really

00:49:53.280 --> 00:50:02.240
 touch your inner core of the true nature of your own beings. That's natural. And relax. It's so

00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:09.920
 beautiful. Keep doing that every time. Maybe two times, three times, or occasionally even in the

00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:17.200
 office, for example, look to your mind for a few minutes, a few minutes to look to your own mind

00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:23.760
 and relax and not wonder. Just keep, let it break, break. That really will help and support always

00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:30.960
 those great elder masters. It really will help. It's true. It really helps. It brings calm and

00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:38.000
 peaceful. That is known as meditation. When we do the meditation, so therefore, meditation is also

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:45.200
 nothing, any unusual, strange things, except relaxing our mind. That's it. Really good heart,

00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:55.120
 good mind. That's it. So that is my brief kind of like talk about this evening and by what I heard

00:50:55.120 --> 00:51:02.400
 from this great elder masters who really practice, good elder practitioners who practice these

00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:02.960
 things

00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:09.600
 and really act like this realization so beautifully. And those great, those elders, sometimes it

00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:09.760
 looks

00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:15.760
 like externally, they're so, so uncomfortable. Looks like, looks like all the kind of not so rich

00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:21.440
 in poverty, the state of heart kept steady. But in health, they're so joy, so happy. They don't

00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:29.280
 complain any. They feel nothing but appreciating and joy and being graceful. That really brings

00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:34.800
 brings by these techniques. So therefore, this is very important and beautiful. And I'm very happy

00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:40.720
 again. I had the opportunity to share and to talk with you. And so thankful to everyone again.

00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:40.960
 Thank

00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:46.560
 you. Thank you everyone. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We have some questions. I'm

00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:55.520
 happy to discuss your time. Yes, please. What about those of us who are quite hyper? Hyper means

00:51:55.520 --> 00:52:07.200
 one. Those of us who are quite hyper, do meditation. Really meditate for maybe let's say

00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:17.200
 for five minutes. Really it will help. Generally energetic. Happel must be means energetic.

00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:24.400
 So it's good. Nothing good. But it will make you stronger and happier and do that

00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:28.160
 meditation for five minutes. Let's start with the joy.

00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:43.360
 Yes, thank you. You talked about love and compassion being so important to achieve

00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:54.320
 happiness and joy and peace. And when I think of love and compassion, the first person that

00:52:55.200 --> 00:53:04.230
 it needs to start with is you, to love you and be compassionate about you. Because when you love

00:53:04.230 --> 00:53:04.720
 you

00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:12.320
 and be compassionate about yourself, you can keep your mind in the present. You can

00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:21.360
 not worry about the past or about the future and focus on everything positive that's happening

00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:26.880
 for you. That's true. Definitely. When I'm talking with love and compassion, it's not that

00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:27.280
 something

00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:34.240
 you love or outside. You have to love to yourself. You have to be kind to yourself. Yeah. And it'll

00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:41.200
 be kind to compassion to yourself. But so this love and compassion is not kind of one

00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:47.520
 focus to one direction. It's focused to the both to one's own side to the other. So even maybe I

00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:53.920
 didn't highlight that that point, but definitely you have to love. You have to compassion like that

00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:53.920
.

00:53:53.920 --> 00:54:02.800
 Therefore, this is love. Our life is so important, so so special, so so precious.

00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:09.600
 With all our personal life, we cannot really do anything there. Therefore, I have to be thankful

00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:16.640
 and happy and love and keep doing good things to yourself in order to also do others. Right.

00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:25.120
 So it's loving yourself enough to avoid things that make you feel bad. If there's something in

00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:33.040
 your life that is distracting you, that is making you feel bad, then get away from it. Avoid it.

00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:39.200
 Yeah, that's also true. You have to see according to your capabilities, your situations. If

00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:39.520
 something

00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:44.560
 that you can benefit to the others, if something's bothering you, if you can benefit it, you can do

00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:50.480
 something so you will help it. If somehow you cannot do that, then you're trying to avoid it and

00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:50.800
 you

00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:58.960
 should not become yourself in that trouble and make some kind of like an indirect helping support

00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:04.800
 to solve those problems if you can. Otherwise, then what we have to do, we have to just pray.

00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:06.320
 Thank you.

00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:14.080
 Yes, please.

00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:17.680
 What is your vision of the world, the future?

00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:23.680
 The future. What is your vision of the future?

00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:31.120
 My vision of the future, I hope it will be really a good beautiful world. I really hope and I pray

00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:40.320
 that that is my hope and pray. My vision, what I like to be, I like to be world as golden age.

00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:48.000
 That's really my vision. So I don't know if I can achieve or not. That is different. But there, I

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:48.320
 pray.

00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:53.680
 Yes, please.

00:55:53.680 --> 00:56:02.800
 Hello. I teach ninth and tenth grade English here in Palm Beach County and many of the students

00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:10.880
 come into the classroom with a lot of aggression and pain that they've experienced and

00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:22.440
 I try and speak with as much compassion as possible to them. But I'm not perfect and sometimes I

00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:23.280
 speak

00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:29.120
 out of anger or frustration and I've noticed they listen to me more when I speak out of anger and

00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:37.520
 frustration. And I know that that's the pattern that I grew up in my household and that many of

00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:44.320
 them grow up in their household is that they listen to somebody when it is with anger but if it is

00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:44.720
 not

00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:52.640
 then it is to not be heated as much, not to be listened to as much. How can I speak to my students

00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:58.240
 who have those pain, who have that pain, with compassion and still

00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:06.160
 hope that they listen to me and still keep their attention and create that environment?

00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:13.520
 That's wonderful. That is definitely, I mean, you have to help to those students as much as you can

00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:19.680
 but even you're speaking those kind of very tough way or those with emotions it looks like

00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:26.560
 but trying to stay with compassion and loving kindness and really you're talking to them trying

00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:33.040
 to make them better person in the future or knowledgeable person future thinking of them

00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:40.160
 really that and what they were told you have to use that and then really with love and compassion

00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:45.920
 for their pretty better purpose or better life and better their knowledge and understanding

00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:51.920
 with that thought then I think if you speak some kind of those letter with emotion I don't think

00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:59.600
 it's really bad and but as long as they listen and good and then I think it's good you should do

00:57:59.600 --> 00:57:59.920
 but

00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:05.360
 yourself are trying to not become emotion and more kind and compassion so your compassion and

00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:12.240
 loving kind is reflected in that harsh statement but yet is really is a compassion and that I think

00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:34.240
 is really I think okay I believe. Thank you. Yes. Yes. All I do when I have the kids like

00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:40.960
 that I just asked them I said how can I help you be what you want to be? That's wonderful really

00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:47.120
 that's another skillful way skillful means way to ask you to those questions to the children's

00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:52.240
 children's or those young ones what do you like to see in the future but so really those are the

00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:59.440
 skillful ways and then maybe you those proper teachers can kind of they're gradually to their

00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:04.480
 destination or what they like to be with that that is also another I think it's definitely

00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:09.680
 beautiful you have to play play I think there are many different kinds of techniques of skillful

00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:16.960
 but always with the love and compassion in heart really that is like that is the principle as much

00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:24.480
 as we can say and then helping to support accordingly to their need and according more

00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:30.800
 their knowledge and understand what like they like to be if you can direct that that is best

00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:37.920
 really the teacher and the best parent really that's what should bring up those growth that

00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:42.960
 state is just really wonderful then they will become I think one of the very beautiful some

00:59:42.960 --> 00:59:56.640
 of the beautiful beings. Thank you. Yes if we sit down to meditate and we want to sort of let go

00:59:56.640 --> 01:00:02.640
 of the tensions or the things we struggled with in the classroom that day or something

01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:10.000
 but it's very difficult like let's say our mind is very restless or you know these thoughts keep

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:19.200
 grabbing us if our thoughts carry us away they grab us how can we what can we do to help

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:25.760
 calm our mind focus our mind and actually even for five minutes meditate

01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:33.760
 was there some other something we can do to let go this is I mean what I said tonight and many of

01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:39.600
 you know more than those things more instructions what I said tonight is basic basic things really

01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:45.840
 basic kind of starting point is and with that then you can use more techniques if you really like

01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:46.000
 to

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:53.200
 know more kind of like more kind of more strongly approach then you can add another one you can

01:00:53.200 --> 01:01:00.640
 concentrate to the object instead of breathing you can concentrate the object if that if you like

01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:00.800
 to

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:08.160
 do those make it kind of some effort possibly and right in front of you you can put maybe a small

01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:16.880
 table on that front table you can put a small small object or small marble marble and like that is

01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:17.040
 a

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:25.600
 focus of meditation stone or my meditation marble and then put that and now you're going to

01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:26.160
 concentrate

01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:34.080
 to do that and keep the posture or the body and the energy level breathing level same but now

01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:42.080
 eye is looking to that marble marble and keep to that or marble any object I say they use the

01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:48.000
 marble but the small one don't have to be a big kind of kind of like small even tiny small

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:55.920
 stones stone kind of shiny is good because it catches eye catch it I catch it catches eye

01:01:55.920 --> 01:02:03.440
 I so small one put right in front of there and then just stay your hand can be this way or putting

01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:10.400
 on your knee both palms on the knee or sometimes say that this is the meta-economity gestures so

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:18.240
 that means our mind is with you with ours us mind is not just wondering mind is now settling

01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:25.040
 this is the gesture they use that too so either one but just relax and really focus to that object

01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:35.280
 that means your mind is with eye eye is two eyes are like to that object almost created not almost

01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:42.560
 the creator like triangle or point this point and that is to the that marble that object and

01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:48.640
 concentrate that and then well you're constantly that way again mind will go away this is just a

01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:55.840
 normal is nothing unusual everybody does that everybody because but so as soon as you notice

01:02:55.840 --> 01:03:03.360
 to buy the mindfulness and bring back without questioning any things and we start questioning

01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:09.760
 what is this we're making more thoughts then yes it become again more thoughts so don't buy any

01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:16.960
 question don't make any kind of say as soon as we notice it bring back mind to that concentration

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:23.840
 see how long you can stay that's trying to be little bit kind of like really with the strengthen

01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:30.720
 I'm going to stay this with this with the object this my mind I'm going to stay with one minute

01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:36.560
 really going to stay it's kind of like really think that and then stay if you're able to stay

01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:43.280
 or anybody can able to stay one minute to be that concentration our mind is settling that

01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:51.440
 but however it will be difficult always the thought comes out in some case more even looks

01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:57.760
 like more thoughts coming than ever all the emotions all that really that happened too

01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:05.360
 is nothing unusual everybody that happened that is just the processes but is even though you feel

01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:14.240
 more thoughts are coming than ever it's not true before we don't notice it noticed and now we

01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:21.680
 noticed noticed and that is for example I think you put it like in the big cities those people

01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:27.760
 sitting in the big city there's so many topics going back and forth they don't think anything is

01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:34.160
 normal it's normal but some people come from on the countryside then they will say oh so much

01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:42.400
 topics so many things happening that they will see this and people who are going through don't

01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:47.920
 see that so now when you are meditating almost you're really kind of coming to the more relaxing

01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:53.120
 areas come here then you will notice that all those thoughts are coming so it's not more

01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:58.960
 thoughts are coming it's just a regular thought but you're noticing that notice that so therefore

01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:06.640
 even though things happen again point is come continue to stay to that object focus that

01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:12.160
 objects when you're kind of focused a little while good report three four minutes that it looks

01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:12.800
 like

01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:18.800
 then you don't have to use those objects then you relax relax then maybe your mind is more

01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:26.320
 calmer more peaceful and more stable for three minutes and you do this again and again this is

01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:32.240
 not going to work for three minutes or four days and a few months and many of those great

01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:40.400
 practitioners really practice this for years years and then they see the big beautiful result comes

01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:46.000
 so if we do even everyday five minutes or ten minutes something we do really well bring good

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:53.040
 result good benefit but have to do again that's what we need joy that's what we need courage and

01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:59.200
 commitment that's what we need this mindfulness that's what we need this love and compare your

01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:08.240
 thought that all was supported and to bring this this to the fulfillment okay thank you everyone

01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:22.480
 again thank you
