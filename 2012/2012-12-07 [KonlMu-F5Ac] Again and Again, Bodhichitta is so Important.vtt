00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 Karmacham, the Kedap Karmacham, scholar, master, and Karmacham. He is the one with very renowned

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 teaching,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 and which is his enlightenment, realization, what he invited, what he got.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:29.390
 It's a train, he showed that to us in the name of the song, the radial hum, the radial hum, or the

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:30.000
 radial song,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 because it is not restricted, constructed by the duality and pre-conceptions.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 As he realized it, he just spontaneously joined, or said to us.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.610
 So this, therefore, is again one of the great teachings. I have mentioned many times this again and

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:52.000
 again,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 but I will say again and again, because it's so important, it's so necessary.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 Once something is so important, we talk that again and again.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 Something is vital to us, we touch that again and again. That is what we need to do.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.870
 This is so important, because it deals directly to our art of practice, our journey to

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.000
 enlightenment,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 how to make ourselves better in a beautiful person, in the whole of the samsara,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:27.430
 and carry our inner wish-go of both each other. Therefore, it is so important, I am going to tell

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:28.000
 again and again,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 and I am going to tell again one more thing that which is so important, which is both each other.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 That you heard a hundred times, or a thousand thousand times, I heard a thousand thousand times,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 but hearing is great, hearing is great. But more than that, to activate that meaning in the heart,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 that is what the great masters of Buddha has taught.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.040
 From the Hinayana teaching all the way to the Vadiyana, the Dzogchi teaching, importance of the

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.000
 being goodness,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.310
 importance of the reveal of our ordinary nature, beauty, nature, that's what Buddha taught, again

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.000
 and again.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.460
 That echoed by all those great masters over in India, as well as in Tibet, and they are not just

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:14.000
 echoed,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.790
 they practice, they observe, they become that. Not just they become the toggle, but they become in

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.000
 that status.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.120
 And that is this, again, we reflected both each other, kindness and compassion of all sentient

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.000
 beings.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 Gathering here is nothing but to activate that beautiful mission of the both each other.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 Both each other means to help the beings, and kindness and compassion, and that is what it is.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.440
 And the next one is then the brain understanding of the true nature, the purity understanding of

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.000
 our self in the whole world.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 All these things in the three various states, those are very important.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 And embracing those all beautiful colors with joy and devotion, with balance, with the econimity.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 That's what the econimity is always what I've taught.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 Econimity means balance, openness, not become kind of emotional and become good, but more relaxing,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.150
 happy, joy, and great joy as like brilliant sunlight shines in the sky, sky is so cloudy, so

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.000
 beautiful, so fresh.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 And blended in, that nature still, not just a kind of pocket is holding these and that things.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:36.670
 That's what's called joy and aperture, and devotion, and then that's known as balance and econimity

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:37.000
.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.200
 And with all those beautiful practices, a beautiful kind of highlight of that, and then we move

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.000
 again to this teaching.
