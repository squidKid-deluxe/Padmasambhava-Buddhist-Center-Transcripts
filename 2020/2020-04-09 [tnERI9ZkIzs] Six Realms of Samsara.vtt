00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 Thank you again. Good afternoon, and thank you very much for coming and participating.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 Thank you, everyone. Thank you.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 Again, I'm going to talk really about the teaching of the precious kindness competitive teacher,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 and therefore, again, we're going to be activating our beautiful motivation of joy and appreciation

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 and involve each other. And then we'll get ready to begin our realization of the teaching,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 which is three various stages. Bring all those beautiful motivations coming up.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 Sizzling status, illuminating status, and then we'll begin to reflect the teaching.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 And now, teaching, today I'm going to talk really about, again,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 among the four realization of Nimjung number jay.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 And today, among the Nimjung number jay, I'm going to talk about Samsara.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 So what I did this last time, yesterday and all that, I've been talking about the precious life,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 the human body, and then impermanence, and cause and effect are inevitable,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 or karma is inevitable. And then Samsara has difficulty.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 Today, we talk Samsara. Samsara is a little very old,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 how it's translated in ancient times, or in the 8th century, those great emanated dance letters.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 Dance is translated as Korwa. Korwa means spinning.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 All one is rotating. That is really Korwa.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 So that means Korwa is always rotating or spinning.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 This rotating is general, of course. We can think, the everything is rotating.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 External is rotating or spinning, inwardly is spinning.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 Nothing is really stop or stays. It's all on the moon.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 All is rotated. But this time, mainly we're talking about the inner beings who lived in Samsara.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 They are spinning. Why they are spinning?

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 Because the cause of the karma, or negative emotions.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 In the teaching it says, "Letting you move on." Karma and negative emotions max rotating.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 That means we can't settle ourselves. They are settled.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 In this Samsara, when it's rotating, it's not just rotating,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 it's regularly or regularly, but always there are challenges, ups and downs.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 In the middle, it's just continually. Always there is nothing that you can rely on.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 And that's also one where good and bad is also not something that you can rely on all the time.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 Bad is changing, good is changing, neutral is changing, everything is changing.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 So that's how really this Samsara is.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 And this Samsara has, if we talk about Samsara, or as the teaching says,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 it has two, and we can make two differences.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 First the general troubles of Samsara, and then specifically the troubles of Samsara.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 And now what is Samsara? Who are Samsaras?

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 And this is again, if I say, in four or five different ways.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 What is the place of Samsara? What is the place of Samsara? Who is rotating?

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 What is the cause of rotation? What's spinning?

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 And when it begins rotating, and how is spinning or rotating?

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 What are the examples of rotations or the spinning?

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 Those are the six different points we can highlight of this Samsara.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 Now where is spinning or what is the place?

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 Place of spinning or rotation is known as six realms.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 In the previous teaching, Samsara is not just only what we commonly know,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 or this human world, but there is, besides human world, there are five other realms of wolves.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 Ramps or wolves, in the world, I think maybe we can use.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:55.000
 So what are those? World of hill ramps, world of the hunger ghost ramps,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 and the worlds of the animal ramps, and the worlds of the human ramps,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 and the worlds of the asuras, and the worlds of the gods. World, w-o-r-l-d, the ramps.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 That's what I'm talking of the world.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 So there are six different worlds.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 That six different world or the ramps is not reserved by any particular individual,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 and a kind of selected group stays with that.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 No, it's rotations. That's all about rotations.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 One who is in hill ramps is not going to sleep forever there,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 and the ones who are in human ramps, they are also not going to sleep forever there also.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 Only in all gods, ramps, asuras, hunger ghosts, and ramps, it is always rotated.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 So that means of all the beings of the six ramps rotating in those six different ramps, different r

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:27.000
amps,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 when they begin to rotate it, when according to the gracious kind of a compaction teacher,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 Buddha said from the beginningless times, no beginning, beginningless times.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 So that means, for example, now I'm here, here, in the 21st century, in the year 2020, I think.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
 In the beginning of April, I'm here.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 But it's not just the first time I came here, or I've been here.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 I've been from the beginningless times.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 And how? Rotations, rotating, coming, always moving, okay, I'm here now.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 And not just me, I'm a good example, according to Buddha's teaching, we all are like the same.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 We all rotate. How we rotate again? It's not knowingly we're rotating.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:46.890
 And you can't well plan the rotating. We are carried by the force of the karma and the negative

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:48.000
 emotions.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:57.000
 We don't need our choice. At the beginning now, as I spoke yesterday,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:08.280
 the choice we have to choose when, what is the cause of this negative, such as karma and emotions,

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:10.000
 is our mind.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 We have negative karmas, negative emotions are not initiated, that's how we have choice.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 We can make the difference, what we like to be.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:31.340
 But once it's done, once it's happened, then we have to follow the force of the karma and the

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:32.000
 emotions.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:38.000
 There's nothing really going to change, except practice.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 So that's how, from the beginningless times, what is the cause of these rotations?

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:58.050
 I already explained, I already said, negative emotions, karmas are cause of the rotations or cause

00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:00.000
 of emotions.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 Karma and the emotions are one's own creations. Nobody else created and overloaded or dropped to us

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
, and we have to carry that.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 No, it's our own, our own creations. We created, created.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 So that is the force of the rotation, or that is the fuel of the rotator, continuous.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 How long this will be going to rotate? Or how long will it be on this samsara?

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:58.000
 Endless. There's no end. Unless we stop, individually we stop, according to Buddhism, every stop.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000
 By how? Stopping our negative emotions.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:11.000
 When we stop the negative emotions, naturally we will stop the negative action, the karma.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:20.120
 Then we are on the process to stop in the rotations, and we're going to have the end of the life

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:23.000
 and the karma, or end of the journey.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:30.000
 That will happen. So that is a long way, unless we stop.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:37.710
 Stop by practicing dharma, simple ways to practice, meditating, cultivating positive attitude or

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:41.000
 positive mind, love and completeness.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:48.000
 What is an example of rotations?

00:11:48.000 --> 00:12:01.080
 That is a technique said as like bees are flying, or what's called this, flies, flies flies in a

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:03.000
 jar, in a jar.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:14.000
 When you put a fly in the jar, or when you put a bee in the big jar, even though they are flying,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
 but they cannot go out of the jar.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:24.540
 They drop it in a jar. They go sometimes up, sometimes down, sometimes the middle, and sometimes

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:25.000
 the cover.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:35.520
 Whatever it is, never going to be able to go out. That's how we are really rotating in this samsara

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:36.000
.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:46.000
 Up, don'ts, all that. But the cause of that, again I already mentioned, is because of karma,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000
 negative emotions.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 Sometimes the kind of good positive attitude with negative emotions will revert in God's hands.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 And sometimes, more negative and more negative, we take rebirth in the lower hands.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:12.460
 And mixture of those which have rebirth in human hands, or according to the variety of the mixture

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:15.000
 of the negative emotions and positive attitude.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 And that creates the karma, and then we take the birth according to those different samsara.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:29.440
 How long we have to stay there in each of those, in each period? That is according, again, if there

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.000
 comes.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:40.170
 That could be like five years, six years, or a hundred years, or more than that, or according that,

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:42.000
 again, able to stay.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 And then again, we migrate. Migrating, or we transfer, or we can rebirth.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 To that again, follow with karma, and our own deeds.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:08.000
 That is the general kind of understanding of samsara. Samsara, how those are.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 And then, during that time, in the samsara, there are three principles, troubles.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:26.120
 All three principles can relate to difficulties, or challenges, or, if I use the word, suffering,

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:28.000
 or uncomfortables.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:41.600
 Three principles. Those are known as pervasive troubles, and erupting troubles, and trouble after

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:44.000
 trouble.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:54.000
 Ever translated more as trouble, or in other words, we can translate it as suffering.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:04.640
 But where is the sufferings? Erupting sufferings, suffering after sufferings, or difficulty after

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:06.000
 difficulties.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:16.000
 Difficulties, trouble, suffering, uncomfortable, unbelievable situation, whatever we let go of use.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:28.000
 All can be almost the same. But that is the tendence of the samsara. We cannot avoid that.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:35.240
 And what means pervasive suffering? In the teaching I said, as long as you have the negative

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:36.000
 emotions,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:47.160
 as long as you have the grasping clinging, the ego clingings, that long there is always hidden

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:51.000
 pervasive troubles.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:16:04.000
 Hidden, pervasive, uncomfortable. That is no different between anyone. Everyone has that.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:13.640
 That is known as pervasive. It is pervasive. From the hell realm to all the god's realms, or from

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:22.000
 the astral realm to the human world, all animal realms, hungry ghost realms, everything.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 Then erupting troubles are translated. Also sometimes also translated as changeable suffering,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
 changeable troubles.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:43.270
 It's kind of occasionally coming. And that is kind of, for example, happening more in the human

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:44.000
 world.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 Human world is generally, or generally, is beautiful realms. It is one of three upper realms,

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 higher standard realms.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:08.120
 It is quite good. But also not really completely. It is kind of free from the trouble. It is going

00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:13.000
 to erupt, suddenly shooting the troubles, sometimes unexpected.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:22.630
 Because the tendence of the pervasive troubles there, therefore some condition circumstances can't,

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:25.000
 it erupts, it counts.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:35.000
 That's known as erupting troubles, or erupting on pieces.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:44.000
 Trouble, upper troubles, all challenge, upper challenge, challenge. Where is that happening?

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:53.720
 It's mostly in a, in a, mostly, or constantly is happening in three lower realms. And hell realms,

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:58.000
 hunger ghost realms, and animal realms.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:05.430
 There is constantly of that happening. That is also not just only those three realms, but in human

00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:08.000
 world we have so many of those troubles.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:15.190
 Troubles, one trouble comes when trying to solve that problem, suddenly there is another trouble

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:18.000
 comes, unexpected. Another trouble comes.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:29.580
 One after another, there is no enough sometimes. Happen. Those are known as trouble, upper troubles

00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:30.000
.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:39.630
 Those are the pervasive problems shared by all the realms. Again, as I said, pervasive suffering is

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:44.000
 kind of mainly kind of involved in the ghost realms.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:51.080
 They don't have a gross suffering immediately. They are kind of invisible ways. It's hidden, kind

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:59.000
 of sleeping, dopey status, kind of in a way an intermission status. But there is, can be.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:05.000
 And human realm is kind of more on it, changeable that trouble, erupting with kind of status.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:11.310
 And human realm is a little more on, sorry, the lower realm, the lower realm is a little more kind

00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:15.000
 of on that changing, upper changing at the top of us.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:24.170
 Those are generally kind of like difficulty challenges of the old six realms or the samsara go

00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:25.000
 through.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:33.380
 So that's generally. But simply in each of those samsara or the realm has then their own kind of

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:37.000
 designated more high like troubles.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:45.030
 Then those are, again, the teachings said, for example, three lower realms, realms we should always

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:48.000
 think in all these different ways.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:20:00.490
 A board there, the area where they are, the body, what they have, what kind of body they have, and

00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:08.000
 how, what kind of challenges they have, how long they are going to experience that.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:16.220
 So that means we are going to reflect our mind. I mean it's not just reflecting, but we highlight

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:21.000
 four different ways of those lower realms, situations.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:30.170
 Place, and then their picture or the current feeling in the picture and what troubles or the

00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:37.000
 experience they are going, how long they are going to experience.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:51.510
 Let's say that, four different ways. And we think of the four that way. The pose, the place of the

00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:59.000
 three lower realms, particularly the head realms, is known as place of the heart and the core.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:10.630
 It's heart and core. Core, area of core, area of the heart. That is the place they live. Heart is

00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:12.000
 not just heart.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.930
 The temperature is like a hundred degrees, a hundred and ten, so a hundred and fifteen, it's all

00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:20.000
 ninety degrees. That's not.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:31.560
 The core entity is seven times more harder than the prior. That's just the minimum of these heavens

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:34.000
. That's heart.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:41.890
 And then plus, there is so many other difficult kind of pictures and areas, unpleasant situations,

00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:44.000
 according to teaching.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:51.000
 So many different things. So that is the place, this place where they stay, have to stay.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:22:03.000
 Their body, what kind of their bodies are. Again, so uncomfortable, so frightful, so sensitive,

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:09.000
 more sensitive than a small baby, even the baby, baby's skin.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:21.000
 So sensitive, by act, so kind of frightful, they steward, kind of unpleasant bodies.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:29.000
 Those are the features that they have to stay until whatever that is.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:38.000
 And what kind of suffering, difficulties? Constantly difficult troubles, according to teaching.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:49.000
 Constantly troubles, very difficult, very tough. Constantly. How long?

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:58.420
 According to teaching, many eons are told in years, hundreds, hundreds of years, almost there is no

00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:01.000
 end. It's that stage.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:07.000
 What is the cause of these disabilities? The cause of teaching is karma.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:20.960
 Mainly it is the anger, raging anger, reflecting that anger and disturbing so many beings by the

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:22.000
 anger.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:39.990
 Greedy, self-important, and then that raging anger arises and disturbs so many beings, and that

00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:43.000
 result is that's what's said.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:50.930
 Then similarly, then one after another, I'm not going to go through. All that you can look through.

00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:52.000
 There are so many beautiful books explaining,

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:59.590
 detailing all that and translating it into English, such as "World, So My Perfect Teacher," "Woke

00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:07.000
 on the Lamb, Shallow." It's really those more details, beautiful, those explainings,

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:15.200
 learning how those are going through. This is nothing but, again, each individual they are

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:18.000
 experiencing through that.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:25.000
 This is like the most difficult nightmares, nightmares they go through.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:33.350
 For example, while we're sleeping in a beautiful bed, calm, peaceful, beautiful house, beautiful

00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:40.000
 room, and everything is perfect, beautiful, and suddenly we have nightmares.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:48.250
 Everything is completely complete. The area, perception is completely changed, such as I'm using

00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:54.000
 the examples. Everything is changed, perception, consumption, everything is changed.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:02.350
 You become dark, trying to call, very trembling, you can't be like, poor, dense, and very kind of

00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:09.000
 helpless, and then went through the big, the biggest nightmare you went.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:17.580
 And this, who's experiencing that? That individually, we're going through that nightmare who are in

00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:19.000
 that status.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:27.000
 Similarly, the hell realm is like also that. Why that nightmare is, what is the cause of that?

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:38.170
 It's because of unknowing the one's own mind, and kind of making distance between subject and

00:25:38.170 --> 00:25:39.000
 object.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:49.090
 Strongly regimented, and then kind of like you be completely crushed with that. And where is that

00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:51.000
 in our mind?

00:25:51.000 --> 00:26:01.000
 Well, we are dreaming. We truly go through that. But when we wake up, what is that?

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:12.000
 Then we can say, "Taste, oh wow, thanks, it is my dream, so good." We say, "Deep breath."

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:22.490
 That's true, really. That's it. So this hell realm experience, all this is like that, our own

00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:33.000
 creation, our own karma, our own dream, which is reflecting back to our own.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:41.000
 It's not something that maybe any other, something that we have to go through, can be anywhere.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:47.000
 I often think, we human beings are always used, also, for example, those animals.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:27:00.000
 Why are they going through all that? Boiling in the hot water, completely dropping in their lives.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:11.000
 Or crying the whole thing. Even they're making crying.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:20.840
 Truly, this individual is going through the elements. So this is what, how it is all experience,

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:22.000
 all that.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:28.030
 It's not something, some 80 that we have to go through. So therefore, this is what the religious s

00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:30.000
amsara has, all difficult troubles.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:40.000
 And for that reason, the cause of this is what is known as negative emotions.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:49.640
 Then, like the hungry ghost has so many difficulties, again, same place, boarding, and then

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:53.000
 troubles, and the duration of the troubles.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:59.000
 Say, "A little better than hell realms." And then animals.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:06.710
 And animals, what is the troubles of the hungry ghost of animals? In the teaching, Oprin said,

00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:09.000
 hungry and thirsty.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:18.720
 That is like, troubles of not finding food, troubles of not finding the water, or drinks. Those are

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:20.000
 the troubles.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:30.140
 And then similarly, the troubles of the human realms, or sorry, animals, is like darkness, or

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:36.000
 stupidity, taking advantage by each other.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:44.320
 Others, even the human beings are using all that one after another. Those are the animals. Diff

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:46.000
iculties are animals.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:55.200
 And then the human realms, they principally highlight the troubles of the birds, getting old,

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:57.000
 sicknesses, death.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:06.000
 And then between days, so many other things, not fulfilling our wishes, losing our hopes and goals.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:12.000
 And then, kind of like, things we don't want is happening. Thanks to what we want is not happening.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:20.000
 All those difficulties, troubles, challenges we go through, those are convenient.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:27.000
 And the other different realms can be had there, but this is mainly in human realms.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:35.000
 And Asura's realm is in the teaching said, they always had some pikings, and arguably, kurals.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:42.000
 And if they can't always, there is that competition, challenges, those troubles always exist.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:50.200
 And God's realm always has troubles of the pulling stones. God's realm is always very precious,

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:54.000
 happy, peaceful, and everything is really perfect.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:01.080
 Until their last, kind of like, last life, their kind of end of the, toward the end of their lives,

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:07.000
 maybe I should say, toward the end of their lives, they kind of just become uncomfortable.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:14.890
 Otherwise, God's realm is constant, always bleak. That's according to the teaching of the Buddha-Sh

00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:16.000
akraman.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:22.900
 What in the teaching said, what are those? There is five different signs that come toward the end

00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:24.000
 of their lives.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:30.000
 And which means they're going to leave that wall, or they're going to change his coming.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:41.240
 It's a sign of the change. And the fourth is that God's realm, the pictures, is so weird, what you

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:48.000
 call it in the teaching, so weird, so perfect, glowing, glowing, bright, and with all of them.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:55.930
 But toward the end of their lives, then that kind of glory is dreaming. That is shrinking,

00:30:55.930 --> 00:31:01.000
 shrinking, so they become more dull, dullness.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:13.680
 And then second, I can sign of the end of their stages, and then they suggest, as they don't have

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:21.000
 any smells on the body, generally God's realm, don't have any smells of the body.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:29.000
 But toward the end of their lives, they have smells coming, and also they're sweating, sweatings.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:37.040
 And then, that is. And the third one is that they're always so happy wherever they go and wherever

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:38.000
 they stay.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:44.470
 But somehow, they don't feel so comfortable to the place they stay, or the thrones, or whatever it

00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:45.000
 is.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:53.000
 That is another sign of the dark that's kind of told in their lives.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:58.250
 And then another thing is, then, because they have always beautiful ornament, according to the

00:31:58.250 --> 00:32:04.000
 teaching, they have so many ornaments, particularly kind of fresh flowers.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:09.590
 Flowers, they have beautiful flowers, kind of decorating their bodies, but now, they're never those

00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:12.000
 big flowers, like they're getting old.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:18.620
 It's always so pretty, so shimmering, glowing, but toward the end of their lives, then these

00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:22.000
 flowers are getting old, kind of obsolete.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:28.000
 And then also, their friends, they're all kind of playing, talking with them, and the friends are,

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.000
 because of the situation, they're a little bit kind of distending that.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:38.720
 Those are known as the sign of the end of their life, and that is according to the teaching, those

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:42.000
 are very challenging, difficult times.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:48.770
 So that means, in the samsara, there is no really kind of like ornament, there's reliable places

00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:50.000
 that we stay.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:56.640
 So this is what the house of samsara is. For those reasons, according to the teaching, we should

00:32:56.640 --> 00:33:04.410
 make ourselves, like really set up kind of ourselves more goals and commitment and resolutions that

00:33:04.410 --> 00:33:11.560
 I'm going to increase my joy, love, kindness, compare towards, and really activate with and relate

00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:12.000
 with that.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:21.170
 And set, change the directions, change the rhythm of the movement of the God. I'm going to do that,

00:33:21.170 --> 00:33:23.000
 I'm going to follow with that.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:29.670
 I'm going to take meaningful of these lives, meaningful of these lives, to benefit to myself, to

00:33:29.670 --> 00:33:31.000
 all the beings.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:36.810
 I'm going to bring more joy, more peace, more happiness, more love, more kindness, compare towards,

00:33:36.810 --> 00:33:45.000
 for all the sentient, according to my capabilities, and more calm, more peaceful.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:51.720
 When we have that attitude in our heart and mind, our action will be more calm, more peaceful, more

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:59.000
 soothing, and more relaxed, and that is known as positive. That is dharma, practice dharma.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000
 So that is my bridge talk about samsara.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:10.510
 Samsara, again, more teacher, you can read, such as teaching, of the great master, the partner, who

00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:18.390
 was my teacher, or from Zala, that those soul, which still is beautiful, and there are other books

00:34:18.390 --> 00:34:19.000
 too.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:25.770
 So that, by that I completed really about explaining of and through of this four-renowned sacred

00:34:25.770 --> 00:34:27.000
 thought.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:33.150
 This four-renowned sacred thought, as I said, the other day, is the essence of the Buddha's first

00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:35.000
 two noble truths.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:41.530
 Suffering truth, cause of suffering truth, will reflect me on that. Once we reflect me on that,

00:34:41.530 --> 00:34:43.000
 then what we should do?

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:49.000
 Then we follow the part truth, and then it will bring the cessation truth.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:57.000
 So following part truth is, begin to practice. Begin to cultivate the beautiful motivations.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:03.720
 With that beautiful motivation, we practice. Dharma, exactly, as laid out by the gracious, kindness

00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:09.000
 teacher, Buddha, Shakyamuni, and Gaurabhama, some of all those great masters.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:14.000
 That is known as the following part truth.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:20.270
 And that is my bridge talk for today. Thank you very much again, and for your participating, and

00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:24.000
 again coming, and then we continue tomorrow.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:30.000
 Thank you, okay? Thank you very much. And now again we do short meditation.
