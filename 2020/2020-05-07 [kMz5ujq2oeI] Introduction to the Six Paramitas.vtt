00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.800
 Thank you very much everyone, thank you very much everyone, and thank you again for participating

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.240
 and making time and be told with the practice of thank you again. Thank you very much. Again we're

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:31.840
 going to extend a reactivity of great motivation or great intention, such as joy and appreciation,

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:38.640
 and then vastness, motivation of the Buddha, and purity, motivation of the realization

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:49.760
 of the S Vaidyana teaching, often taught us and all the great masters, the teachings are always

00:00:49.760 --> 00:01:00.720
 reminding us those so please reactivate those, and with those, we illuminate, light up, and

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:08.960
 we put the switch on of all our good motivation, and with that clay light status, we follow the

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:15.200
 words of the teaching of Buddha Chaturmani, as well as the deity masters, and this time,

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:22.080
 we're following the teachings and instructions of the great Japji, the New Room, which is his

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.080
 teaching, so again, of course, you know, basically, whenever you already know, so I participate in

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.240
 all

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:34.960
 that, and now again, so I'll just go over that, and we've been told that we divided, or I divided,

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:41.840
 that into three groups, and the beginning novel, and the middle novel, and the concluding novel,

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:49.920
 all in it, is known as tambassum, so we kind of put that in that frame. The reason I'm putting that

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.920
,

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:58.000
 and I make it so many times, because we like to, our practice becomes so practical, and so

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.280
 and progressive, and also the practice we like to become as whole part of the practice,

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:12.080
 whole, whole practices, not just a kind of piece of practices, so we like to make this calling,

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:19.200
 calling as college, college practices, and to do the college practices, or some authentic,

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.040
 good practices, then in the teaching, measure these three novels, what three tambassum,

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:34.810
 tambassum is so important, and it makes everything, then novel, novel, and it elevated our self

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:35.680
 from

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:44.320
 the impurity, or in-noble status, to the normal status, so therefore, this is again, very important

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.400
.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:51.680
 In that frame, as we talked first, this novel is the motivation, again, we said so many times,

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:58.480
 one after another, and I mention those again and again, so for this motivation, which is

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.080
 so important, and that motivation, or that intention, what we like about our self, we're

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:10.400
 going to keep continuing that on our, the principal part of the practice, second motivation, or

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.800
 second

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.480
 number, we're going to keep, not just only the second number, we're going to, that move to the

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.680
 third number, the concluding status, even though it's a slightly different kind of like,

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:28.720
 highlighted aspect of the practices and nobility, but reality is basically the same,

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:38.320
 we're touching to our goal of true nature, our own being, our own nature, that started from the

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:48.480
 original or beginning status, never diluted, never obscured, that authenticness we like to reveal,

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:57.680
 so this to reveal that this, this number, this three novel, is that's the way, so now, I go over

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:04.320
 with the personal novel, I mentioned already, and there's nothing, I mean, there's many things to

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.560
 say

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:12.480
 still, but I will go to the second one, second one is then, in the recording, the bodhicata level,

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:20.640
 it is actualizing bodhicata, actualizing bodhicata, and actualizing bodhicata, or from the

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:28.000
 motivation, tell all this final company, this tampa song, if I use another terminology,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.880
 that great teacher would highlight at the very beginning of the teaching, the four novel truths.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:43.360
 Among the four novel truths, this tampa song, three novel, is following the part truth,

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:56.640
 this is part truth, absolutely perfect part truth, that is, we are preparing and advancing and

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:08.100
 moving and developing our pure nature, and reversing the old habit pattern that leads us in the s

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.360
amsara,

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:15.520
 through the big list, we're reversing or we're transforming, we're transmuting that,

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:26.560
 therefore, this is really so important, this, this part truth is so important to get enlightenment,

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:35.920
 or as great teacher Buddha said, cessation truth, cessation truth is not going to come by itself,

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:44.880
 it is going to depend on the cause and conditions, that cessation truth, the cause and conditions,

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:52.560
 also we're going to invite the cause and the conditions according the result of the cessation,

00:05:53.520 --> 00:06:01.600
 cessation means what, I think I said many times and you all know, cessation means something ceased,

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:09.920
 something finished, what ceased, obscurations ceased, negativity is ceased,

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:18.480
 the old habit pattern is ceased, when that ceased, when that finished, what we're

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:26.080
 revealing, the old in the nature, that is enlightenment, Buddhahold, that we're revealing,

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:33.840
 but that Buddhahold is not just going to come, boom, as like suddenly going to a pivot,

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:42.960
 that light, that Buddhahold begins right when we enter part truth,

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:53.680
 right, until, when we enter, when we pursue the part truth, the illumination, light,

00:06:53.680 --> 00:07:03.280
 it begins right then, and as we continue to pursue, as we continue to keep our courage and

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:03.840
 commitment,

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:15.200
 that light becomes brighter and wider, stronger and stronger, and that is known as at once in the

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:22.480
 light, or at once in the path, at once in the boomies, therefore the greatest teacher,

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:34.560
 divided all those, our development of the inner, inner realizations are lined up as pipe path,

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:44.080
 ten boomies, this is pipe path and ten boomies, not just externally existing, it is at once,

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:54.800
 as it is developing our realizations, also when when Buddha had kind of clarified all those so

00:07:54.800 --> 00:08:03.040
 perfectly beautifully, when we add once in each time, it will bring more joy, more confidence,

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:11.200
 more commitment, more loving kindness, more compassion, more openness, more simple,

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:21.360
 more humble, more kinder ones, soft heart, all those brings, just growing, growing, growing,

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:30.240
 and developing, developing, then expanded beyond any borders, beyond any horizons,

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:40.320
 that is enlightened, until that the light continually will usher us, that in the light,

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:50.160
 energy progress will continually usher us, the path of the joy, therefore both each other,

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:57.040
 both the south of the path are known as path of the joy, from the joy, from the joy,

00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:03.920
 moving to the joy, more joy, more happiness, more peaceful, more courage, more commitment,

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:09.760
 more openness, more kind of negative emotions are going away, one after another, or it's getting

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:17.280
 less and less, and that's really how, for that reason, the devant robots in the teaching said,

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:24.480
 from the joy to the happiness places, from that place, moving forward with the happiness and joy

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:33.760
 in the peaceful, at once, therefore, God's God, great Bodhisattva, is never going to feel leadiness

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:43.200
 and bored by the practices, because it brings joy, peace, happiness, fulfilling the wish to benefit

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:50.880
 for all living beings, and fulfilling the wish of your own self, or your purpose, purpose to one's

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:57.840
 own self, purpose to other's own, it is what is commonly called in the West, we say win-win,

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:06.640
 truly win-win, it is a win-win-win situation, win-win news, from when we pursue that,

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:13.680
 that is really win-win, truly, this win-win is not just for a few months, a few years,

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:23.840
 in this life, this goes on and on, life after life, peaceful, peaceful, one after another,

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:31.760
 therefore, it is so special, so for that reason, again, I go now, I'm going to talk about this

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:40.000
 actualizing Bodhisattva, actualizing Bodhisattva is a conduct of the Bodhisattvas, once you have

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:46.400
 the beautiful motivation of the, or intention of the wishing Bodhisattva, now you begin to

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:52.560
 activating that, not just only mental state, activating through the verbal, through the

00:10:52.560 --> 00:11:02.400
 physical, you begin to activate it, according your capabilities, according readiness for others,

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:12.560
 as I said quite a few times, and with peaceful men, with polite men, with courage and commitment,

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:21.520
 state courage and commitment, state, state past as the mountain, strong and deep as ocean,

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:32.880
 open as sky in the teaching center, that's what we move on with humble, simple, huh, and peaceful,

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:39.200
 we add muscle, so that the activity of the Bodhisattva is in the teaching center, it's

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:47.280
 numerous, like ocean, it's numerous beneficial activities, but all numbers of ocean lengths

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:54.000
 activated, beneficial activities of the Bodhisattva, summarize into these six paramatas,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:02.880
 pargaresh, chicha, buddha, shaktamans, summarize into these six paramatas.

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:12.000
 Six paramatas in the Tibetan world is parvartu cimba, and in Sanskrit is paramata,

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:20.880
 and in English, I think it translated transcendental, transcendental westerns or transcendentals.

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:28.800
 What would be the part in the Tibetan, for example, parvartu cimba? Parva means other shows,

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:43.170
 sambam is going or lifting up to the other shows, what other shows? Other show is show of the

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:43.600
 beyond

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:54.960
 dualities, all other show is beyond the noblities, novels, that indicating this show where we are

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:55.200
 is

00:12:55.200 --> 00:13:07.760
 noble, not noble. It is not noble. Where we are is samsara, samsara, full of coyotes,

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:18.080
 full of difficulties, in troubles, so from that bone we are elevating our self to nobility,

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:25.990
 pre-from the negative emotions, pre-from the karma. That is what we are being, is parvartu, parvart

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:26.240
u.

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:34.080
 And the cimba, actually in the teachings of paramata, is beyond the conceptions, so that means

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:43.920
 no attachment, no grasping, no cleanings, going through other shows. That is really meaning of the

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:53.920
 world meaning of the paramatas. And there is six paramatas, and that which is, again,

00:13:53.920 --> 00:14:01.920
 it is paramatas are the practices. It is what we are going to practice or what the bodhisattva is

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:09.920
 practicing. Every paramata is best upon both each other. Now again, if I say more clearly,

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:20.370
 every paramata is best upon whole worldness. On another world, every paramata is best upon

00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:20.880
 compassion,

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:30.880
 compassion. On another world, sambhuludra, every paramata is best upon good heart. It's a good

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:37.280
 heart. So if I use good heart, so when we do the generosity practice, it's best upon good heart.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:47.280
 Morality is best upon good heart. And patience is best upon good heart. And then joyful effort,

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:54.320
 concentrations, wisdom, all compassion is absolutely best upon compassion.

00:14:54.320 --> 00:15:02.640
 That compassion is how much, how big, that you remember, we used to, I mean, not just we are

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:12.400
 talking that, boundless. It's best upon the boundless, boundless compassion. So our

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:22.240
 generosity practice is best upon the poor, boundless. Our morality is the best practice,

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:31.600
 is the best upon poor, boundless. And so forth, one after another. All is the best upon poor,

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:40.640
 boundless. Again, sambhul said in the teachings, compassion, that's it. Compassion and wisdom is

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:48.960
 best upon compassion and wisdom of the great emptiness. That is what really these paramatas.

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:55.920
 Now, these paramatas, as you all know, we all know, we all know, we all heard this

00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:06.560
 terminology many times, as we know, the six paramatas. As I said, six paramatas are the practices.

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:15.520
 Practice what we're going to practice. We're going to practice that both in the post meditation

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:23.120
 and meditation states. It's not just only one time, one sight. We're going to practice this

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:33.200
 continuation and the both state of the post in and in meditation or practicing states.

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:39.280
 So therefore, all practices of the greatness teacher, Bhadakhya Chaitanya,

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:49.520
 summarize into three extraordinary tenings. Three extraordinary tenings. Those are known as

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:55.440
 lappaasanas. Only a few weeks ago, when we were discussing about the Buddha's teaching,

00:16:55.440 --> 00:17:02.960
 the secretarial and the realization of the practices. Secretarial are three

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:08.720
 basket teachings. And the realization of the practice are three extraordinary trainings.

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:16.080
 That's what we discussed. So now this time is a practice. So this is the three extraordinary

00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:25.200
 trainings. Or in it a bit, lappaasana. That's what is lappaasana. And that is again, of course,

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:32.800
 you remember that. One or three extraordinary practices or trainings is extraordinary training

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:40.960
 of the moralities. Extraordinary training of the concentrations. Extraordinary training of the

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:49.280
 worship. Those are the three practices. The entire Buddha teaching is summarized, or teaching of

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:49.360
 the

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:59.040
 practice is summarized into these three. That is, doesn't matter whether it is teachings of the

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:07.040
 Punditian Buddhist school teachings or his own Dalai Lama using as a Pali language or Pali

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:12.320
 best upon the Buddhism teachings and Sanskrit best upon the Buddhist teachings or the Vedayana

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:19.600
 teachings. All is best about these three extraordinary training teachings or extraordinary

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:29.440
 practices. So first is, if I use symbol, which are the moralities. And the second is concentrations

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:29.440
.

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:38.800
 Third is questions. So now how these six parameters are summarized into these three extraordinary

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:47.840
 teachings or practices. First three, what is that? I'm sure you remember.

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:58.400
 First three is generositys, morality practices, patient practices. Ah, first three of the six

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:06.480
 paramatas. They are, if we summarize that into that three practices, they are the morality

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:07.120
 practices.

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:17.600
 It is the morality teachings, ethics, morality teachings. And the fifth paramana of the six

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:28.240
 paramana is what? Concentrations. That is the concentrated extraordinary practices. That is,

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:40.160
 last one of the six is wisdom. That is wisdom practices. So now we completed five paramatas

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:49.600
 into three practices. Then one of the, one of them we're missing, we said five. One of them,

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:59.920
 that is joyful effort. Joyful effort support to all of those three. Joyful effort is the principle

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:08.000
 support and yeah, support of the morality. Joyful effort is principle support of the concentrations

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:17.680
 or the meditation. Joyful effort is the principle support of the westerns. That's how it is.

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:28.960
 Three extraordinary practices. Then these practices, when you practice of these six paramata

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:29.520
 practices,

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:38.960
 what is we developing? What is happening when we practice that? Of course, we all know

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:48.400
 it is brain realization, understanding. And deep in our practices, deep in our understanding,

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:55.840
 knowledge in muslims. But also in the teaching making, I mean that is true that is, but in the

00:20:55.840 --> 00:21:07.280
 teaching making, it was increasing the two merits. Two merits. We often heard two merits. Those two

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:20.160
 merits are accumulation merit, western merits. That is one. That is what is accumulation merit

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:30.800
 and western merits. So now these six paramata practices, it will bring them or increase the

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:40.640
 two merits. Accumulation merit and western merits. What is accumulation merit? Accumulation merit

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:40.800
 is

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:53.440
 in the teaching, it is available. The merit is something that you can perceive. You can function

00:21:53.440 --> 00:22:04.080
 something to the mental stages or physically wobble. That is namjhi sonam jitsu. Namjhi,

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:12.560
 that is merit. Accumulation merit. Wisdom merit is something that you cannot

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:24.200
 perceive in tangible ways. It's like beyond the conceptions, beyond the worrying, beyond the levels

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:24.240
.

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:35.360
 But yet you will experience with your own pristine cognition awareness. That is

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:47.360
 western merits. So these six paramatas, fourth true, generous practices and morality practices

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:58.480
 is the principle, cause and condition to activate the accumulation merits. Accumulation merits.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:13.840
 Last one. Last one, western paramata or western paramata is then the western merits.

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:36.240
 The merit that we cannot be focused, we cannot hold beyond the conceptions. That merit is westerns.

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:47.600
 One has all other threes. They are in the teaching saying all those are the support to both merits.

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:57.200
 What that all means now, that means patient, that means joyful effort, that means concentrations.

00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:05.360
 Those all three are going to support to increase or activate the increasing of the two merits.

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:17.360
 Winter merits are increasing. If I use terminology merit may be as the energy or vitality of the

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:25.120
 inner strength. When it's developing, what we put it by? What we cleaning? At the same time as it

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:36.080
 comes, at its growth, we cleanse two obscurations. Emotion obscurations, knowledge obscurations,

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:46.640
 we put it by according, we put it by. So therefore, these six paramata practices so, so, so special

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:54.800
 and powerful, that encompasses entire practice of the sutra mahayana and vediana mahayana's

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:55.680
 teachings.

00:24:55.680 --> 00:25:05.360
 It is really powerful and it is best upon, as I said already many times, best upon this, the

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:14.320
 poor, boneless, all poor, boneless, and when yesterday we start talking about the equality,

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:23.680
 tungni, and others are more important than the once on sub. That principle, that compassion,

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:38.400
 that kindness, that willingness is best upon all that principles. Therefore, it is so powerful,

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:51.280
 so special, spacious. It is so authentic and it is so organic. There is no condensation of

00:25:51.280 --> 00:26:00.560
 self-importance and self-centered minds. Therefore, it will defeat all negativities,

00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:06.640
 it will defeat the ego clings. We bring true realization of the ego-ness status,

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:14.560
 ego-less status, and we will bring true realization of everything as a great emptiness,

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:23.440
 emptiness, and apparent union of the great emptiness. That what's called in teaching is

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:29.840
 individually ego-ness status and a predominant ego-less status. Truly, it will bring that

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:36.400
 realization. How are we developing that? In the course of those two ego-less realization or that

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:43.440
 intellectual theory is generally developing through the learning from receiving the teaching

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:50.160
 and contemplate on that, then in the teaching said it will bring that kind of glimpse of the

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:58.160
 view or idea. It really will bring that realization. And then that also kind of as the Buddha said,

00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:03.920
 as Nagarjuna's and all those great masters said, and you put also your intelligence

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:13.680
 and you have and then you see all these phenomenal existence are as task-lucid states or as magics.

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:26.640
 There's no substantial solid existing, one particles. All is lucid. All is just completely

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:35.840
 combination. And there's nothing that you can find one solid existence anywhere in this world

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:43.680
 and beyond the world or anywhere in the subject level, in the object level. When he has said that

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:52.320
 theory that realization that according Buddhism that is a perfect theory, perfect is line of the

00:27:52.320 --> 00:28:01.920
 true desire. What is not perfect? Clinging as solid. Solid. Clinging on such existing solid

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:02.480
 existing.

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:10.160
 That is just mental clingings. In reality, there's nothing is existence. It's all

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:19.440
 as compromises are exploring or explore. That's the way. But in the Buddha teaching, I think it's

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:26.240
 going even further more steps than the quantum physics. There's nothing existing both subject

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:36.880
 level and object levels. Same humans. But yet all is arising. Why? It's a circumstance, a

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:37.760
 combination

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:46.960
 of the cause and conditions arising magically and then functioning magically in the magic world

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:56.240
 or functioning as a dream world as it is perfect dreams, even though it's not existing solids.

00:28:56.240 --> 00:29:03.840
 And our notion is always living, kind of always evolving something that even though it's really

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:12.160
 not existing. For example, what now? What is the month now? It's May. This May. We think May is

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:20.880
 kind of truly existing. But where is May? The day one we started May until the end of the May.

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:30.240
 Where is that May? May, have you started thinking of that? Each particle of the times or the

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:30.720
 moments

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:37.120
 is chain of the moments. Even moment that there's nothing exists is solid according Buddhism.

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:44.080
 It's just a conceptually nominated, that change. Then hold onto that.

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:51.760
 And that is our samsara duality mind clinging to everything like that.

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:58.720
 Everything clinging, even though it's not existing. Since it's not existing, it's

00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:07.510
 illusion display, therefore it's changing, properly changing. One up another is changing. Not

00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:07.920
 changing

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:14.000
 or the original level is changing, but instantly level changing according to the teaching. Even

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:22.640
 though maybe we don't, maybe we don't detect that, we never notice that reality is changing every

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:32.160
 second. Moving from where? To where? It's from that display of the illusions,

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:40.800
 from the emptiness. Moving in the emptiness, going to the emptiness, is all show of the

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:50.880
 great, the openness or emptiness and vastness. Therefore, one in the teaching said, or as I said,

00:30:50.880 --> 00:31:00.320
 the second novelty with all focus, with all grasping. All this, our meditation, realization,

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:10.080
 is also magic. There's nothing to hold, nothing to grasp. But as we follow this magic, we think

00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:18.320
 we are suffering with magic, magic suffering works. In a way, magic of the ocean, ocean,

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:27.920
 and it serve the purpose to the magic beings. It do works. That's a system known as interdependent

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:34.800
 coordination systems. So therefore, everything is like that status. So as we practice the sixth

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:41.760
 parameter, then it increases the understanding of realization. When we reach it, according to the

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:50.400
 teaching, when we reach to the post-bumi, that time, then your realization will come exactly as

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:58.560
 you meditate. And as I said earlier, in the post-part, we will understand theoretical accumulation

00:31:58.560 --> 00:31:59.120
 part,

00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:05.840
 this realization comes as theory, as kind of intellectual theories. But then in the second

00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:13.040
 part, application part, it will come as kind of more experience. Now getting a little more sense.

00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:21.200
 And then in the third-bumi, or third part, same part, you're going to see exactly as it is true

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:29.280
 nature. When you see this true nature, it's not going to change anything except the perspective

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:40.080
 of the perspective of the knowledge. And our grasping is shifted, or it is kind of disappearing.

00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:47.280
 But here, otherwise, everything is going to function. Exactly the same thing with this time,

00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:54.880
 even better, more fancy, more sophisticated, more stronger, more deeper, more effective force.

00:32:56.320 --> 00:33:03.200
 You know the mysteries of the way the nature is. Again, and then you begin to really see them. You

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:09.360
 can play the dynamic display of these. And there were those great masters sitting on the sky,

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:16.400
 walking through the walls, walls, dust forming fire into the water, water into the fire.

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:24.000
 Those are loosely truths, kind of like stories, those are like stories. It's not, it really can

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:24.320
 happen.

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:33.040
 When you have the power over the mind, and then it comes to power over the matters,

00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:41.440
 matters, it changes, shifting things. That's true evidence. Even, for example, material power,

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:48.960
 how much change by the scientific? Scientists, how much change? When you power,

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:57.120
 power becomes our mind. When you power over our own mind, or according to the teaching,

00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:06.240
 it really will become, you will become the master of the materials. Masters, they have ancient time

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:13.360
 in the teachings, they have many great masters. One changes to the many, many changes to the ones.

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:22.080
 And also, in Christianity story, the days of Christ say, dust form, one bread, one lot of bread,

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:31.200
 so many breads, one bowl of the beard, man feeds so many beings. That is true. When you become the

00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:40.160
 power over the materials, you change. Nature is open, nature is flexible. We see how things

00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:47.920
 happen even in the material world by the scientists. That shows the glimpse of the window of the

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:54.400
 mystery of the natures of beauty and their openness and their flexible states. So therefore,

00:34:54.400 --> 00:35:03.200
 this practice of the Sikh Parama, the practice, will bring realization and defeat all the obstacles

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:03.200
,

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:10.400
 bring joy and peace, happiness to every living being without any discrimination. That is the

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:17.760
 beauty of the bodhicitta and the bodhicitta activities. Now, I go back again to the Sikh

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:24.880
 Parama a little bit and continue to go over this. Now, the Sikh Parama, generally in the teaching

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:33.840
 sense, this order of the Sikh Parama, first is generosity, then the moralities, then the patience,

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:43.200
 then the joy of effort, then the concentration, then the resistance. Why in these orders? Because

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:52.160
 if this order, because first is easier than the second. Second is more easy than third. Third is

00:35:52.160 --> 00:36:00.320
 more easy than the fourth. Fourth is more easy than fifth. Fifth is then the final one's death.

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:09.040
 So therefore, generosity is easy. Everybody can do some duty, generosity, but morality is difficult

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:09.040
.

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:18.320
 That is difficult to compare with generosity. And then morality is a little more easy than the

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:28.800
 patience. Patience is difficult. Difficult. But when the patience, then joy of effort is, again,

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:34.160
 a little more difficult than the patience to keep continuing. Maybe we can do one patience, one

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:34.640
 time,

00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:42.720
 two times, three times, but joy of effort means continuous. That is quite difficult. Then the

00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:50.240
 concentration is difficult. Even everything is perfect and beautiful and nice. We can see

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:58.560
 ourselves too. Our mind is not stable. No matter whatever we do, really restless always. Even

00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:04.240
 everything is quiet and peaceful. This monkey mind thinks something and makes it distracted.

00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:15.040
 And therefore, again, so that wisdom is more difficult or more finer than the concentration.

00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:22.000
 So therefore, it is completely kind of, that's why Buddha made that order. So I called him,

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:27.280
 the original teacher, the Buddha Shakyam, and his teachings are accordingly cover-billed of them.

00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:36.560
 Cover-billed with the individualist, he showed path. Never post and never do, but skillfully

00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:45.200
 leading to the path, to the ultimate goal of the realization as we can happen. And so that with

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:45.520
 that

00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:53.840
 understanding and that six paramatas are lined up in that six, six levels. And that is my brief

00:37:53.840 --> 00:38:00.960
 talk about the reaching, actualizing both each other. And then again, we go there more and

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:10.960
 continually. I'm talking, the talking always, maybe you all kind of feel very strong all the time,

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:16.560
 both each other and reaching both each other and actualizing both each other. Those are kind of

00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:23.040
 going almost like exactly going in the like, what's called the land in the Midwest and Texas and

00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:23.200
 all

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:28.800
 those things. There's no synergies and no, there's just a continually going, same thing, kind of

00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:29.200
 like

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:37.600
 same, almost the same thing. You see the horizon, you see the flat land, but there's nothing really

00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:43.440
 happening. Maybe you're thinking that, but I think they're attaching to the really core of the best

00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:48.720
 of the teaching of the Buddha Shakyamuni. And that's how we really develop it. And we're doing

00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:54.720
 that according our capabilities, our capabilities, following the light of the greatest teacher,
