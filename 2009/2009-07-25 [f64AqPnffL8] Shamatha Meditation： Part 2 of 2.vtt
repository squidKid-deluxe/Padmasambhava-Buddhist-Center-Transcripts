00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 This is the experience or experience as running river or running stream from the mountain.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 But generally, that running coke and abiding coke both are the same.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 There are no patterns, because both are mind.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 Abiding is mind, running is mind, is one's own mind. There is no difference.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 There is no difference between the two talks.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 There is no difference between the two talks.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 There is no difference between the two talks.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 Running talk and abiding talk. Both are both. Both are the same nature.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 It is the same one, same nature, same mind.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 And when that is happening, without disappointment, and the cities are the same.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 No comment, don't do this.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 An emcee get, is two mind or not? Two different mind or one?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 The running mind is one mind and the city mind is another one.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 When you emcee get, this is the same.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 There is no two different mind.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 When you have time, you should do this meditation.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 For example, maybe three days.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 Or whatever your time.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 Do that alone and really reconstabilize your mind.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 So you feel this many different mind.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 Running mind is one, abiding mind is one, and sparking mind is one.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 Then, if you feel like that way, or if you feel like that way,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 you feel like you are kissing your grandma.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 And again, emcee get, where is that? Or what is really different?

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 Emcee get, do it alone, do it alone, do it alone, do it alone.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 Have you realized that this is the same mind? It's the same, there is no difference in mind.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 It's not me, it's not them.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 See the kind of something, see the kind of thing, see the kind of thing,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 take care of your whole truth.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 If you see this same mind, then you also emcee get,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 where is it coming from? This is his mind.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 And where is this mind going truly? And where is now this mind?

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 And then, again, when you look this way, when you search this way,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 then you will see what the answer comes.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 If you look where is mind coming from, if you didn't find,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 then that is what you find the source of mind. It is not any find.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 And you also see where mind is going.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 And when you look to that and you didn't find the destination of the mind,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 so then you didn't find destinations or we didn't find the destination.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 Then we look to where this mind is abiding.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 And then now also we didn't find any abiding supports.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 So we didn't find. We did not find the source.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 We did not find the destination.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 We did not find any platform where mind is sitting now.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 So then we didn't find anything.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 When you didn't find anything, and then again rest on that stage.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 Now don't emcee get and it's rested in the state of not finding.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 And that when you didn't find anything, when your intelligence looked,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 looked and tried to search, you didn't find anything,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 then it's not as then. It's restless.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 Or there is no space. And that is, is not as then.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 Searching to the wisdom.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 You gain the search into the wisdom, there is nothing really find or nothing to tell.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 At least we find that.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 Not there. Not there, Mr. Henneman.
