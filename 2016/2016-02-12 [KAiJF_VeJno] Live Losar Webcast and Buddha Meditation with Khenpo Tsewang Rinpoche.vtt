00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 So many happy New Year's, which is wonderful.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 We can celebrate. So again, this is another happy New Year.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 And this is one of the very special year for the Tibetan culture and the Tibetan people.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 This is year 2,143, the royal year of the fire monkey year of Tibetan countries.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 So every Tibetan is celebrating today.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 I kind of take that as very special and significant.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 And also it is marked one of the very special event in the Buddha's teaching.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 And the Buddha Shakyamuni performed many beautiful beneficial activities

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 to benefit all sentient beings without any exceptions.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 Among that, this month, particularly this lunar calendar,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 the first day to the full moon is known as miracle activities.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 One of the very special event that the Buddha performed again to benefit so many beings

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 and to inspire so many beings to the path of enlightenment,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 the path of love, kindness, joy, and peace, harmony, and respect.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 So this is considered again another very kind of special in the Buddhist calendar.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 So therefore, this kind of according to Tibetan tradition of the secular tradition is New Year.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 And Dharma tradition is very special day of the Buddha in the multiplying month.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 And so this take this, as I said, a very special event.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 So I really like to say to everyone all over where we are connected to this time,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 like to happy New Year, and we hear all the best and good health, joy, peace,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 a lot of prosperity, a lot of realization and harmony, understanding,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 and bring the really peace and peace and joy in the heart,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 and spread that as a ripple effort throughout the world.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 And not just only this year, continually until everyone really reach that goal

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 and wish that in combined that with the bodhic,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 that's why wish very much that call to everyone.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 And thank you very much everyone coming and participating.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 And again, once again, happy New Year.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 And it will be the USA.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 Los Atrakshi Delhi and Los Atrakshi Delhi.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 And mother have always warm and good and warmness, something that said.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 So I wish all that to everyone.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 And with that understanding and with that contrast, again, we do practices.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 Again, it is strengthening our connection to the Dharma.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 And we do that practices as part of the celebration

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 and part of the fire monkey year begins.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 And the fire monkey is also another very special event.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 It's called the Numa, the Buddhism of the Numa schools.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 And it is a year, birthday year of the Gharapama Sambhava.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 So again, it is very special, many ways.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 So that special time, we are all gathered in Sangha in this beautiful Dharma center

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 in Palm Beach with beautiful devotion and joy and appreciation.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 And with the Buddha Dharma, to Buddha Dharma Sangha.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 And we celebrate that is so wonderful.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 And thank again, everyone, thank you, thank you, thank everyone.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 Thank you, thank you.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 And now we begin the practices.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 You all have this yellow booklet.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 And then we're doing the Buddha Sadhana here.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 Buddha Sadhana, most of the time, we're both at a time.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
 And all that, so we do mostly in English.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 Practicing in English, okay, so.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 Yeah, either way, thank you.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
