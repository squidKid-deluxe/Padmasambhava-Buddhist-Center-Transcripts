 In today's mantra, that Buddha meditates right in the sky, the big and beautiful, in body matter,

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:14.960
 all the Buddha's bodies of every healing powers. And then as we chant the prayers,

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:22.080
 and the Buddha sends so many blessings, light from the forehead, and the speech is central,

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:29.040
 and as well as heart chakra, and from their bodies, emanating so many blessings, lights,

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:37.040
 and beams of light, rain of light is coming all over the world, and every single living beings

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.640
 are completely attracted with that light. Light, and it removes all the suffering, the difficulty,

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.920
 troubles, all sicknesses, whatever they were, completely removed, not just that removed,

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:56.960
 the cause of those sicknesses, deep down is three poisons, ignorance, attachment, and anger,

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:03.600
 those are all removed. Really thinking that, so our kind of power of concentration and

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.640
 compassion, and the blessings of Buddha, merging together, drawing that, have those kind of

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:17.760
 high light with meditation, and then we chant these mantras. Each Buddha says, each Buddha is like,

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:24.160
 we chant a different Buddha, but each Buddha also embodies all the Buddhas. It's not just single

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:30.080
 individuals, they encompass all the Buddhas. That's why it's called embodiment of all the Buddhas.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.000
 Each Buddhas are embodiment of all the Buddhas.
