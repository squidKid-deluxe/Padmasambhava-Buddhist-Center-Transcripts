00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200
 First, maybe I'll talk a little bit about what is the Vibhachana meditation.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:15.640
 Vibhachana meditation is actually Sanskrit word, and which is translated as Langthong.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:21.120
 And again, the great Muslim K.G. Pardeshan always says, "Why is Langthong?"

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.440
 or "Why is Vibhachan?"

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.080
 "Vibh" means supreme in Sanskrit.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.760
 Vibhachana means seeing, supreme seeing, supreme seeing.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.840
 And what means supreme seeing?

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:40.800
 That you never saw before, before, and now you beholden that.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.680
 That is, what is that?

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.280
 That is the exact nature of everything.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.640
 This is then Mahamudras, named Mahamudra or Dzogchen,

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.960
 or emptiness, Pandya Paramata, Madhyamaka.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.240
 Now you behold.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.360
 Exactly.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.720
 All those philosophical systems, that negative establishment, that, that result,

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.400
 that this is the result, that now you see, see this.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.840
 And what is this now?

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.600
 If I say simply, no grasping.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.520
 Vibhachana means no grasping.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.640
 Now Shamatha has grasping.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.440
 Shamatha has focus.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:43.080
 Your focus, that focus is grasping, grasping.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.880
 And Vibhachana has no grasping.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.720
 This grasping, what in the teaching device, in the Buddha teaching,

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:59.240
 generally if you look, generally teaching, grasping divided into two.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.520
 The larger grasping and the personal grasping.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.240
 Larger grasping and the personal grasping, too.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.920
 The personal grasping is what in the teaching called ego clinging.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.440
 It is a clinging, or it is grasping.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:25.240
 Clinging, clinging, grasping, either word we use, it's same, personal clinging.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.760
 The larger grasping is phenomena grasping.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.840
 The all phenomena are grasping.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:38.480
 Grasping, we grasp phenomena many ways, with the level, with the title,

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.080
 with the idea, with the presumptions, and all that with the grasping.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.680
 That is larger grasping.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:55.280
 And the personal grasping is ego clinging, ego.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:01.480
 And ego clinging is the fundamental cause of the samsara,

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:07.720
 individually concerned, individually.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.640
 And of course, largely all the samsara is kept by it

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.000
 because ego clinging in the samsara.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.120
 Ego clinging, the person that is clinging is the cause of the samsara,

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.520
 our samsara, each of our samsara.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.160
 For that reason, great master, Nala Yuna said in the teaching,

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:34.760
 "As long as you are grasping to the aggregates,

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.400
 and that long you have the ego clinging.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.280
 As long as you have the ego clinging,

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.320
 that long you have the emotion and it is activities."

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.320
 That means karmas.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.080
 Then samsara is moving.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.080
 Samsara is standing.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:04.840
 And also therefore, ego clinging is the biggest obstacles for us,

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:10.880
 for our personal concern, obstacles, the demons.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.680
 For that reason, again in the great teaching,

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.240
 which many times talk that, it kind of ranks in my mind, always that.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.240
 He took quotations from Guru Purnima, some of them said,

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:29.120
 "The ego clinging is the demon where this demon comes from,

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.200
 is from one's own consumption.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:39.360
 This demon does not come from outside and enter our body, our self.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:47.000
 This demon comes from our own thoughts, our thoughts."

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.240
 And some of the things, great master again,

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.960
 he's on the Dajjal we said, one of his teachings,

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.960
 one of his Dharma teachings he said,

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.200
 "I, the egolessness wrathful,

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:07.320
 came, ordered, you, ego, live right now, now.

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.480
 If you don't live right now,

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:17.520
 this egoless king wrath will destroy you in the state of the nothing,

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.680
 stateful nothing, that you will be destroyed."

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.360
 He said that.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.680
 It's true.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:29.000
 This ego clinging is the really the biggest demon.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.520
 And then what the great master Shati did was it, one of the cities.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.120
 From the sense of the biggest time until now,

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:43.800
 all the troubles and difficulties, the challenges I went through,

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:48.000
 it is your ego, your ego.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.520
 This big demon, why I'm going to keep this now?

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.640
 This big demon, why I'm going to keep this now?

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.840
 This is how we're going to defeat this ego.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:10.080
 There's no other solutions to defeat, release, remove the ego.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.040
 It's only vipassana meditation.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:24.720
 Vipassana meditation is the most powerful and yet so simple technique

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:30.000
 that will play with the person's ego clinging troubles

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:37.920
 and as well as the phenomena larger that clinging, grasp.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:43.160
 And that is known as Mahamudra or the Dzogchen.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.400
 Or because of what you see, you never saw that before.

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:52.840
 Never ring that in our mind before Buddha talks.

00:06:52.840 --> 00:07:00.320
 Today is ringing clearly that bell song in our heart and mind

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:06.080
 and also somebody be holding that with the intellectually

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.680
 that never did before.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:12.920
 Therefore, it is known as supreme seeing, vipassanas.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:16.480
 That is what we see today.

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:23.520
 So this is the but. This is the but meditation.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:30.240
 That is again is whether it is personal clinging

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:34.040
 or is phenomena larger clinging, it's clinging.

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:38.480
 Simply put word in the clinging, clinging.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:41.600
 To clear where that is the vipassana.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.200
 Therefore, it's called vipassana.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:48.160
 Sing as I said for Mahamutras.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.640
 Why how to do this?

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:55.160
 With the best of that shamatha meditation, calm and peaceful,

00:07:55.160 --> 00:08:02.320
 rest and relax that natural status, now you're going to look inwardly

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.840
 to in that shamatha meditation.

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:08.760
 In that shamatha meditation, every day is anything.

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:10.560
 You're going to look inwardly.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:15.640
 When you look inwardly to that shamatha, there's nothing to see,

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.480
 nothing to find.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:24.360
 It's total open and freedom.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:31.680
 That is the ultimate nature of the mind, mind, mind.

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:37.600
 And to bring that realization because that is realization.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.720
 That is your realization.

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:43.000
 To bring that realization always in the teachings

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.040
 that you should have the certainty wisdom, certainty knowledge,

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:49.120
 certainty what was does.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:56.640
 Certain means no doubt, no hesitations, no lingering,

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.040
 no twisting mind back and forth.

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.480
 You settle.

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.880
 That is called certainties.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:06.640
 So meditation have to have certainty.

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:09.600
 For those reasons, then in the teaching days, of course,

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.360
 Nagarjuna, in the Buddha teaching, there's so many ways

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.760
 to analyze those teachings.

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:18.040
 We went really with the [inaudible]

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:20.600
 and also like for different techniques in the Madhyamaka,

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:24.880
 those astellic, every phenomena exists in a great emptiness state.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:29.200
 And then the kind of jaryat techniques, techniques of the,

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.200
 or the reason and things, kind of astellic,

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.280
 there's no ego clinging and so forth.

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:34.560
 Those, all that.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:39.000
 But brain don't, boil down all those logic and the reason and things

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.080
 to go to the simple state that is, is to our mind.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:48.320
 Mind is what the great Masjid the Doki teacher used to say that.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.440
 And we don't let the smoke in the room.

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.960
 That means the ancient time in the Tibetan.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.880
 They cook food inside.

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:57.000
 Of course, how that everybody does.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.200
 But they always have to have the wood.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.520
 Wood, all that.

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:04.240
 So what that means, cow dung, not cow, young dungs and so forth.

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:07.360
 There's many times the smoke is that.

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:09.240
 House becomes out of smoke.

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.560
 Smoke is that.

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:13.840
 You don't let the smoke.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.200
 You don't let the smoke out.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:20.680
 Put down the fire from the, from the stove.

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.920
 Put down. Put down, right?

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.480
 Put out. Put out.

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:30.640
 Put out the fire from the, from the, from the stove.

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:35.320
 Stops. Then, of course, naturally smoke stopped.

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:39.480
 Similarly, bring down all these different things.

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:45.040
 If we come to the boil down to the essence point, is mind,

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:49.000
 from mind we're going to reveal the old essence teaching

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 of the Buddhas, that emptiness, nature, what Buddha taught.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.960
 That is actually what Buddha taught.

00:10:54.960 --> 00:11:00.480
 All those teachings bring up to this pyramid, pyramid to the point

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:03.400
 that Dzogchen teachings, all the Mahamudar teachings,

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:08.920
 inspires, pyramids, pyramids, pyramids.

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:14.320
 Pyramids, all the teaching to the point is to the mind.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.640
 They bought that.

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:18.400
 But to a gradually lead everyone,

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:22.480
 from the Hinayana gradually to the state point.

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:25.480
 When we discover the mind, natural,

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.720
 we discover everything.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:30.200
 Everything, okay.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:34.000
 And therefore, to go through all different analyzations,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.080
 simple analyzations, things, what in the teaching.

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:39.640
 Here, like the great master mentioned to you,

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:41.120
 very briefly those things.

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:44.280
 As you know, we don't have to go through all these things.

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:46.440
 And that's simply of the looking.

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.480
 Where is the mind?

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:52.720
 Mind. Looking to the mind's, mind's past, present and future.

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.680
 Where is the mind?

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:56.680
 Where is the mind in the past?

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:58.040
 Where mind is now?

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:01.280
 Where mind is in the future will be.

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:05.280
 And we started to analyze what answer we're going to have.

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:07.800
 A mind has a form, what kind of form?

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:16.320
 Is it rectangle, square, triangle, long, short, what?

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:20.360
 Any of those, if you apply the color, what color mind has?

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:23.240
 White, yellow, red, blue, green, whatever color.

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:26.560
 If you apply any of these thoughts,

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:30.200
 that anyone, even you take in the mind and try to ask that,

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:34.200
 find out with the mind, it's none of those.

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:37.160
 There's no answers, speeches.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:40.760
 Every question whatever we ask to this mind,

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:45.040
 it reaches the same point to the speechless states.

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:49.240
 That is nature.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.400
 And then where is grasping?

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:53.640
 Clinging, it's something.

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:58.240
 That's such a big obstacle. Big hand is true, it is a big obstacle.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.800
 Where is that?

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:04.120
 Even that is not.

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:05.880
 Not any places.

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:08.880
 It's not in the past, not in the future, will be.

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:14.520
 Not in the present, any direction, any sight, any place.

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:16.240
 That is what matters.

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:19.600
 That is a, with that, we're as servitors.

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:24.840
 To continue your cave as mind, simply in the Buddha teaching, as emptiness.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:27.520
 Emptiness. Emptiness is not just blank emptiness,

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:30.000
 it's beyond the emptiness, not emptiness.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.920
 It's beyond any category of thoughts.

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:35.840
 Any imagination.

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:40.400
 It's speechless, inexpressible.

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:43.320
 It's like sky.

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:45.680
 It's not like blank sky, blank sky.

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:49.480
 It is infinite fullness sky.

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:52.960
 That is the nature of this mind.

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:55.360
 How to behold that? How to go?

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:57.840
 With that understanding, we're going to maintain.

00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:00.560
 That, I said before, is meditation.

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:02.000
 That is meditation.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.080
 Maintaining, up-keeping that with meditation, with techniques, I said,

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:13.040
 joy, joyful effort, mindfulness, alertness, can be economic.

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:16.480
 Economic means no effort.

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:22.400
 Not making effort. Relax, calm, and peace.

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:24.720
 When we meditate, there's continuity there.

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:27.960
 We maintain that status, then we move.

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:34.400
 Our realization is advancing, and our realization is deepening.

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:37.520
 Those are known as then, moving to the stage's body.

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:41.520
 It's named as a status, but there's nothing to move in extended

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:47.640
 as the stage's status. Stages. It's all inexplorations.

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:50.840
 Discovering. Discovering.

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:54.680
 So that is my brief talk today, and thank you.

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:57.680
 I won't have a question today.
