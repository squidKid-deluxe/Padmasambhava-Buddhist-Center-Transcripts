00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.160
 Sometimes we use the practice to convenient our reasons. We use our convenient reasons

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:16.720
 to convenient to make more of our convenience activities. Sometimes we use the view to cover

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:24.000
 up the conduct. Sometimes the conduct we use to cover up our views. Many times it does that.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:33.040
 Many times we take view as easy exit, emergency exit. It is that. And such as we are all, we

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:41.040
 are the practitioners of the Vedayana. We can do anything. Vedayana, everything is the mandala.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:50.320
 It's true. Everything is the Buddha mandala. It's true. So it's true. Sound is mandala,

00:00:51.040 --> 00:01:00.960
 palm is mandala, palm is mandala. It's true. It's true. But it's question. We have that realization

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:00.960
.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:10.080
 Really we have realization that. Then it's different. We don't have that realization.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:22.720
 We don't use that teaching to make ourselves that easy of convenience and jump back to our habit

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:30.560
 patterns. That. That we shouldn't do that. This is many times they do this. The Vedayana teaching,

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:38.800
 you can drink. You can drink. Or we should drink. I heard sometimes, I hear these quotations of

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:52.560
 poverty. Alcohol is gasoline. Alcohol is a gasoline full of copper so that they can move.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:02:03.200
 I heard that pattern. It's true. Maybe they can move. But when they're moving, I don't know.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:11.360
 They're really moving. Then, they sometimes say, "Oh, in a zuki, it's open. Everything is open.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:19.040
 Completely freedom. Therefore, I can do anything. I can't do anything to do." You shouldn't

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:27.840
 restrict anything to it too. Two. That is, is then we feel back to the ditch. Therefore,

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.800
 always the great master said, "Don't follow your contract with the will." Will.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.640
 If you follow, that was Buddha and Muruga Mahasma said, "You can't do something."

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:51.600
 Can't do something. He said, "Oh, great king. Great king. Contract should not follow with the will.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:03:01.680
 And when you follow the contract with the will, that individual will become completely as an

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:11.600
 adolescent status. There's no virtues. There's no good, good action. No bad action. And all this

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:18.320
 is just the same. It's completely filled beyond an adolescent status. Even worse than a regular

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:26.720
 person, ordinary person. So therefore, Muruga Mahasma said, "Oh, great king. Oh, great king.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:35.360
 Don't follow the contract with the will. If there you follow, you will become the nihilism status."

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:46.640
 And then he said, "Don't follow the will with the contract." Contract. If you follow the will

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:56.430
 with the contract, then we cannot come out of the dualities. Dualities, again, we are completely

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.480
 lost

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:07.120
 in the duality. So that means what? The will is open. But contract, as Muruga Mahasma said,

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:13.360
 contract is finer than the flowers. It's so many subtle, so many details. Contract is,

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:19.520
 you know, we're dealing with samsara. There's so many rules, like this and that. Then every kind

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:26.320
 of brain, the will, that our will becomes so small, so narrow, so long, and then it really won't

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:35.200
 break anything. Therefore, we should separate the will and contract. And the teaching said, again,

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:43.920
 Gurbia Mahasma said, will, what they call, will, is ascending, I believe, or descending. Will is

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:56.160
 descending and conduct is ascending. Conduct is ascending. That means will keep, will must be

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:04.400
 applied with the conduct where you're meditating. Meditating. You're not going to court with all

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:10.720
 these things. Just blend it. Don't worry. That's why let it come. Let it go. In the teaching said,

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:19.200
 let it come. Let it go. Relax and register. So you are not caught in that. But when it comes

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:27.200
 to the post-meditation state in samsara, then even you have the highest realization as the almost

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:35.130
 lingua, we have to follow the rules and regulations, guidelines in samsara, exactly where the

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:35.520
 things

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:46.560
 are. Not jumping, not overlapping. Follow it exactly as it is. That is what we need. So then

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:56.720
 conduct is ascending, will is descending, and merge in the heart, not outside.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:04.160
 Outside. And that's what we really need to do. For that reason, therefore, the many times in some

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:11.120
 great master said, this great master, master, I mean, it is again a linear quotation from the

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:22.880
 linear masters. You say, we should be brave. Brave with the will. We should be brave.

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:30.560
 Conduct should be timid. This is the western world, all of the western.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:40.880
 Conduct, when it comes to the conduct, it should be timid. And we need to come to the will. Brave,

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:51.440
 embarrassing. We should not be timid. Will is vast. Dzogki is vast. Vast and open and freedom,

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:58.160
 and don't be timid. Don't get fair with that. That will. But when it comes to the conduct,

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:03.680
 timid. Then don't do. Have it. You have to be thoughtful. You have to be mindful. You have to

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:10.000
 be there for his cause. Timidity. Those are experiences, great Dzogki masters, lineage.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:17.440
 Lineage and structure. Lineage and structure. So we should do. And we do that. Then we have become

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:24.480
 beautiful person, beautiful practitioner. Yogini, yoginis. Yoginis, good in the dharma,

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:31.600
 but also very cooperative, nice, appreciative in the samsara, samsara vod.
