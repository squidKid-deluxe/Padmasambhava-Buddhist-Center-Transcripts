NOTE     "synopsis": "Main Topics Being Discussed\n \n1. \"Q: What do you mean by the primordial nature of the mind?\nA: In the higher levels of the Buddha's teaching it is said that all the phenomena we perceive are simply displays of the mind. The deepest nature of the mind, the enlightened mind, is known as primordial awareness. All mental activities arise from primordial awareness, and if we recognize that, then enlightenment manifests in every thought and perception. If we do not recognize it, then thoughts and perceptions continue to be obstructions that cause suffering.\n In order to awaken inner wisdom, it is necessary to break down the dualistic concepts that posit an internal subject and external objects. Typically, we perceive ourselves as individual subjects who experience objects that are separate from the self; we feel distance and make distinctions between the two. The feeling of being a subject who relates to objects is simply a notion of the mind. The mind alone creates the concept of a separate self. Once that conception is formed we hold on to it, although from the primordial point of view the self does not really exist. To overcome duality it is necessary to cultivate the equanimity that encompasses both subject and object. Practicing love and compassion is extremely helpful in terms of understanding the inseparability of outer and inner reality. To recognize everything as the perfect activity of the enlightened mind is to realize the primordial nature of pure awareness. Sometimes this is called rigpa. Rigpa is the innermost, true nature of the mind, our awareness which is fresh, uncompounded, and very open. Along with emptiness, rigpa contains clarity, loving-kindness, wisdom, and skillful means.\" (pg 108 last two para, pg 109 first three par)\n\n2. \"Q: What is the relationship between dzogchen and bodhichitta?\nA: The Dzogchen teachings are the highest teachings of Buddha Shakyamuni. From the Dzogchen point of view, everything is totally equal in one profound state, without duality and distinctions. Dzogchen is the ultimate view of the true nature of mind, which includes love and compassion. When we practice Dzogchen we develop compassion and loving-kindness; Dzogchen practice cannot be separated from bodhichitta practice. We cannot ignore relative bodhichitta and accept absolute bodhichitta; both are part of our true nature and both are part of Dzogchen.\n For this reason, before we meditate, we take refuge and develop the thought of bodhichitta. After we meditate we dedicate the merit to all sentient beings. Whenever we practice or do any kind of beneficial activity, we should not cling to it. At the absolute level, everything is totally pure and perfect in great emptiness. From that point of view, we are completely free from all dualistic concepts and clinging. ...\n Every person has the enlightened nature, but to actualize that nature it is necessary to practice bodhichitta, the love and compassion for all beings. Bodhichitta is universally precious; everybody appreciates it and everybody has the potential to develop it. Enlightenment is completely dependent upon developing compassion for all beings. The wish to attain enlightenment for the benefit of others is the essence of both the Mahayana and Vajrayana paths. When we develop inner wisdom, we can take care of all sentient beings, and radiate compassion and kindness throughout the universe. We can discover the true nature of the mind and of the entire world. In order to be able to do this, meditation practice is very important.\" (pg 100 last par, pg 101 1st and 2nd par)\n\nImportant Terms\n\nDzogchen. Often translated as the \"Great Perfection,\" Dzogchen represents the highest teachings of Buddha Shakyamuni, comprising the ninth and last yana of the Nyingma school. The term \"Great Perfection\" can be understood to mean that all the Buddha's teachings are utterly complete and perfected in Dzogchen; thus, all nine yanas are encompassed, without contradiction, in this the pinnacle of every vehicle. (Liberating Duality, pg 158-9)\n\nprimordial nature. Traditionally referred to as buddha-nature, this is the inherent nature of all sentient beings, and the essential teaching of both the Mahayana sutras and the tantras. Although the beautiful, radiating qualities of mind are often obscured by temporary dualistic conceptions, the nature of mind is the unborn, indivisible union of emptiness and compassion, pervading all subjects. Briefly, the emptiness aspect of the nature of mind is known as the absolute equality of emptiness, whereas compassion is the clarity aspect of the nature of mind that radiates out to oneself and others.\" (Liberating Duality, pg 171)\n\nPBC YouTube Videos\n \nEvery Teaching Leads to Dzogchen and Dzogchen is Beyond Conception\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pqawiR7AY",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.160
 Hello, welcome again to the PBC Morning Dawn study group from Padmasami Lane, the Venerable

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:13.460
 Kambaramiches Monastery in New York. Today we'll be doing the final chapter of their book,

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:19.000
 The Buddhist Path, which is entitled Questions and Answers. It's chapter 21 and begins on

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.080
 page 103. So thanks so much for joining us. We'll do our usual opening prayers and then

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:31.240
 we'll begin the discussion. Thank you.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:01:11.360
 [Singing in Dzogchen]

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:32.640
 The supreme tradition of the glorious Buddha Padmasambhava, which is the essential, extraordinary

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.760
 view and doctrine of the early translation school. You keep alive and spread by the light

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:44.000
 of wisdom. Lord of Dharma, great Kimpo, I pray at your lotus feet. In the palace of the old

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.420
 man Dhammadattu, the essence of all the Buddhas of the three times, the one who shows clearly

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.520
 the Dharmakaya of my own mind, we pray to the honourable Rukuru, glorious true teacher,

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.640
 precious one, dwelling on the lotus seed and the crown of my head. Hold me with your great

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:30.320
 kindness and bestow the accomplishments of body, speech and mind. [Singing in Dzogchen]

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:53.760
 So again, we'll begin on page 103, the chapters question and answers. And since this whole

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.520
 chapter is just a series of question and answers, that I'll just go through and summarize about

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.680
 half of them. And then we'll go to our first topic of discussion. And then we'll summarize

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:10.720
 the second half and then have our second topic of discussion. So beginning on 103, someone

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:16.920
 asks the Rinpoche's, what do you mean by sentient beings? Rinpoche's reply, we are known as

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:17.360
 sentient

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:23.360
 beings because we have consciousness or mind. Specifically all sentient beings have the sixth,

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.080
 seventh and eighth consciousnesses, otherwise known as dualistic consciousness,

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:34.560
 Klesha afflicted emotion consciousness, and Elias storehouse consciousness. Among the six types of

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.600
 sentient beings, human beings are highest because their minds are highly developed. Among human

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.480
 beings, it is possible to develop our mental capacity further than we might expect, revealing

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:50.080
 more and more of our inner wisdom and its power. Then there's another question where someone asks,

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:56.530
 how are emotions related to mind? Rinpoche's reply, emotions are part of the relative level of mind

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.880
.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:03.200
 Mind can be divided into at least 52 mental events, including the negative emotions, which all come

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:09.120
 from ignorance. Negative emotions keep the mind from remaining in the natural state. They come

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:16.240
 from imbalanced, confused mind, which is always unstable and changing. The third question, if you

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:22.720
 maintain a clear, empty mind for a month or a week, is that enlightenment? Rinpoche's reply, on the

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:28.080
 relative level, all the meditation practice you do gets you closer to enlightenment. It purifies

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.760
 negative emotions and reveals your natural goodness qualities, but don't expect to become

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:39.440
 completely enlightened after a short period of time, like a month or a week. The following

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:45.920
 question is, is meditation the only way to reach enlightenment? Rinpoche's reply, meditation is

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:46.160
 very

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.760
 important for realizing enlightenment, but we would not say that it is the only way. There are

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.920
 different ways to meditate. The Buddha taught many techniques for reaching enlightenment, and they

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:56.080
're

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:01.680
 all based on concentration and discipline. Then according to Dzogchen, to reach enlightenment,

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:07.200
 we have to recognize the nature of our mind and maintain this recognition uninterruptedly. When

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.560
 there is no longer any grasping that could possibly interrupt our abiding in the natural awareness,

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:18.400
 then we're enlightened. Fifth question, do you have any advice for when you realize that you

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:25.120
 have done something unkind? Rinpoche's reply, the very moment of recognizing a negative action of

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:31.680
 thought is the first step, sorry, the very moment of recognizing a negative action or thought is

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:31.840
 the

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.880
 first step to purifying it. First you recognize it, which puts your mind into a greater balance and

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:43.680
 reduces the tendency of that act to happen again. Then you consciously decide not to act that way

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.560
 again. In addition, if you've hurt others you can do meditation practices for them related to the

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:53.920
 six paramitas. The first four paramitas increase the positive energy or merit for yourself and

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:59.850
 others. Concentration tames your mind, and wisdom reveals the inherent absolute nature of

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:00.320
 everything.

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:06.080
 In Vajrayana, all of these six paramita practices are combined in a practice like a meditation on

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:13.040
 Vajrasattva, which is particularly helpful to purify negative emotions. Then someone asks,

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:18.800
 an additional question of Kenshin Pauld and Sherib Rinpoche. Kenshin Rinpoche, they asked

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:25.840
 him to describe his training, and this is on pages 105 and 107, and since the answer is a bit long,

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:32.400
 I kind of just really quickly summarized it. So I said briefly, Kenshin Rinpoche started learning

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:37.760
 to read at the age of four. At the age of seven, he began learning and memorizing certain rituals.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:43.120
 From the ages of seven to twelve, he studied history and biographies of the Buddha and Guru

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:50.160
 Padmasambhava. From ages of 12 to 21, he went to Riruche monastery to learn the five major

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:56.000
 and minor sciences. So the five major and five minor sciences, including Karabhava, Mahayana,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.320
 Vashriyana, and Dzogchen. At the age of 21, after his studies at Riruche completed, he fled Tibet

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:08.880
 with his family. In 1965, Kenshin Rinpoche was asked by his fullness, Dzogchen Rinpoche, to attend

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:14.000
 a conference of Tibetan scholars and masters for one year, to keep the lineages and cultures of

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.400
 Tibet alive. In 1967, Kenshin Rinpoche helped establish the Institute of Tibetan Studies.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:27.840
 And then from 1967 to 1983, Kenshin Rinpoche served as the head abbot and main professor

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:34.320
 of the Nyingma Department of the Institute. He first came to the USA in 1980 and returned to live

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:43.200
 in the United States in 1983 onwards. Then an additional question was about when people begin

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:49.520
 meditating in Tibet, what age? In Riruche's reply, in the Nyingma school, students usually start

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:56.400
 meditating around the age of 12 when they're also began learning the major sciences. So those are

00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:01.200
 summary questions about the first half of the chapter. I think now Anna will read our first

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:12.560
 question of discussion. This question is on page 108, last two paragraphs, page 109, first three

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:21.520
 paragraphs. Question is, what do you mean by the primordial nature of the mind? And then Kimbo's

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:26.880
 reply, in the higher levels of the Buddhist teaching, it is said that all the phenomena

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:34.480
 we perceive are simply displays of the mind. The deepest nature of the mind, the enlightened mind,

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:40.320
 is known as primordial awareness. All mental activities arise from primordial awareness.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:46.080
 And if we recognize that, then enlightenment manifests in every thought and perception.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:51.920
 If we do not recognize it, then thoughts and perceptions continue to be obstructions

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:58.640
 that cause suffering. In order to awaken inner wisdom, it is necessary to break down the

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:06.240
 dualistic concepts that posit an internal subject and external objects. Typically, we perceive

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:11.600
 ourselves as individual subjects who experience objects that are separate from the self.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:18.720
 We feel distance and make distinctions between the two. The feeling of being a subject who relates

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:25.440
 to objects is simply a notion of the mind. The mind alone creates the concept of a separate self.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:32.800
 Once that conception is formed, we hold on to it, although from the primordial point of view,

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:39.920
 the self does not really exist. To overcome duality, it is necessary to cultivate the

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:45.680
 equanimity that encompasses both subject and object. Practicing love and compassion is

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:51.840
 extremely helpful in terms of understanding the inseparability of outer and inner reality.

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:57.360
 To recognize everything as the perfect activity of the enlightened mind

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:03.680
 is to realize the primordial nature of pure awareness. Sometimes this is called

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:10.000
 ripa. Ripa is the innermost true nature of the mind, our awareness which is fresh,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:17.280
 uncom pounded, and very open. Along with emptiness, ripa contains clarity, love and kindness,

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:24.640
 wisdom, and skillful means. Meditation reveals this awareness that we all have.

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:32.320
 To recognize the movements of the mind as the display of wisdom and to let thoughts arise

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:36.240
 and go their own way is called the natural flow of awareness.

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:53.840
 To start us off, I have a word question and that is just why do they refer to this as primordial

00:10:53.840 --> 00:11:01.040
 nature? They don't actually explain the primordial quality in their answer. I just wonder

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:08.880
 just as a jumping off place to discuss why are they calling it the primordial nature of the mind?

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:25.120
 Well, it seems like they do mention in the question, like they say, to recognize everything

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:28.800
 as the perfect activity of the enlightened mind is to realize the primordial nature of pure

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:39.200
 awareness. So it seems like they're talking about pure awareness throughout, but also

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:48.240
 they seem like they're emphasizing how the absence of the self, how there is no subject,

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:58.400
 how the sense of self is just imputed but doesn't actually exist. So I guess that

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:06.720
 kind of points in the direction of, you know, so if what we, in other words, if what we take to be,

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:12.160
 if what we always take to exist, you know, our story like we were talking about I think earlier

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:18.480
 today, I am this and you are that and everything is like this because that's the way I see things,

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:27.200
 you know, that if we take that as our point of departure then we're not really, you know,

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:39.920
 uprooting the, you know, that basic fundamental idea that it's a display of primordial nature

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:43.520
 instead of just that's the way it is.

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:51.520
 You are like the idea that what you're talking about here is original nature and then talking

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:56.080
 about the self, it's almost like just something that's added on top, it's like a fabrication,

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:58.720
 a creation later, something like that.

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:08.960
 Which is such a radical notion in terms of reality, the way that it seems like,

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:13.040
 at least I know I experience it that way most of the time.

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:18.000
 Yeah, I remember one time having a conversation with my son when he was young, he was about

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.520
 11 or something and I was talking to him about egolessness and he said,

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:27.200
 sorry mom, I'm right here, I exist, I'm sorry you can't tell me that I don't, you know,

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:32.320
 that's just how we are, you know, that's our natural point of view,

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.880
 not maybe not natural point of view, maybe that's the wrong word but...

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:41.920
 Even in Western philosophy I think it's that same way, like that Cartesian bedrock of Western

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:48.720
 philosophy, I think therefore I am or I doubt therefore I am, it's that sense of I or ego that

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:54.800
 me as being here doing an activity, thinking, doubting, that's undoubtable.

00:13:54.800 --> 00:14:03.200
 Because I doubt I must be here to doubt, I mean because I see things I must be here to see things

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:09.040
 and if there are objects to look at there has to be a looker, it's like totally the bedrock of

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:16.080
 Western philosophy and it's like the, that is like the root of our duality mind or of the mistake,

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:22.480
 I mean that in Buddhism they say that's the fundamental mistake, that gut level assumption

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:28.720
 that there is this I or this me that's here at the center of things, at the center of experience

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:33.760
 or something and that everything else is kind of on the periphery or than being related to.

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:39.520
 I think definitely so primordial is relating to just how they talk about in this, in their answer

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:47.440
 that before our awareness splits itself into a sense of perceiver and perceived or I and what's

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:54.880
 not me, that subject object is primordial is like how the mind is before it becomes dualistic.

00:14:54.880 --> 00:15:00.880
 Yeah and also just like in terms of trying to really kind of understand what would be an

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:05.280
 alternative view to the sense of being a separate self with objects is what they're saying here

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:11.200
 about that everything is actually a display of the mind it's like that notion of the radiance

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:16.080
 of the mind that that's what this is that you know that we have awareness and somehow we,

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:21.760
 there's some sort of interpretation of it as being an agent that there's an agent here who is aware

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:27.840
 and is therefore acting and so forth you know but that it in a sense you could just see it as

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:34.800
 awareness and awareness is manifestations of thoughts and emotions and perceptions and

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:40.800
 sensations and you know that's that's what it is it's just the display of primordial awareness.

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:49.840
 What's that um the way they describe it it's like the rippa and then sol

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:58.560
 comes oh rises from rippa or is that right and then wind moves that and then it and then our

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:04.720
 one of our consciousnesses one of our consciousnesses are like our I can't remember you know do you

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:10.160
 know what I'm talking about it was in fundamental mind we talked about it you know this process of

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:16.720
 how we concretize yeah how the display happens yeah and I was just thinking about that when you

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:25.200
 said that yeah yeah and then also sorry I just yeah sure rippa I've heard you know here it seems

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:25.360
 like

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:32.800
 rippa I know is awareness right like fresh naked awareness sort of or primordial

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:43.040
 awareness primordial awareness yeah yeah but that yeah it's realized sometimes this is called rippa

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:49.760
 so they but in so I guess beside rippa it definitely seems like they're talking about

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:56.800
 fundamental mind I mean nook sim right so I just thought that was interesting because they sort of

00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:06.400
 they just they talked about it in terms of rippa I guess more so I'm just curious

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:10.480
 why maybe I don't know why what why they're calling it rippa

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:19.600
 yeah or I guess I mean they're not yeah I don't know I think you know it seems like

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:23.760
 you know what the people said many teachers too there's all these different names

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:30.080
 yeah just all kinds of different names for for wisdom or awareness or fundamental mind

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:35.760
 or original mind or you know it's just like dharmakaya and what just goes on and on and on

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:39.360
 there's so many you know they're just because I think that you know certain words connect with

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:44.400
 certain people you know so you hear a certain thing but you don't hear other things and so

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:49.360
 then that's why they repeat so much you know every once in a while it gets through to someone

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:55.040
 yes they say in a slightly different way because they're also talking about would you say I don't

00:17:55.040 --> 00:18:02.560
 know but ground luminosity as well would you say that I would say that same thing yeah

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:08.000
 pure awareness yeah we can put all these on the vocabulary

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:14.160
 and on the back there's a definition of primordial nature and it lists some of these synonyms

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:20.240
 Buddha nature absolute bodhicitta, prajna-karmita, mother of all the buddhas, medyamaka, mahamudra,

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:25.280
 rikpa, these are all synonyms for that what is it nyawokadak or primordial nature

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:33.840
 I think a beautiful part of this like in Rupache's reply here when they're talking about the radi

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:34.160
ating

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:42.800
 qualities of natural awareness it very it's very distinct from the fundamental the foundational

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:50.160
 buddhism view of no self so if this is not just saying that there it's not just saying it's

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:56.000
 it's it's without any rigidity or any fixity or when you look for it there's nothing fixed there

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.760
 so that's no self we feel like I am me and it's I'm continuing and it's I have these

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:08.720
 real essential characteristics and that's what I am and it's the fix it's the rigidity of that

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:14.080
 feeling of in other concepts we kind of cover it that there is they say that's not there that's

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:22.240
 that self in that way is not there no self there's no rigid absolute self but there is a relative

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:28.160
 self there's a relative apprehension of subjectivity awareness and so it's not just a total

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:34.640
 negation saying absolute self no there's not absolute self because in the medyamaka or middle

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:40.400
 way teachings they barely clearly go beyond both of these poles self and no self there's this

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:45.440
 awareness or primordial nature and so then you that's why you can highlight all these radiating

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:49.920
 qualities these natural expressions and displays because you say a display of what because a

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:54.240
 display of no self how can nothingness display and that's what they're saying they're not saying

00:19:54.240 --> 00:20:01.600
 it's nothingness they're saying it's it's not that fixed concrete unchanging independent sense of

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:01.840
 me

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:08.480
 that's there that's not there it's totally relative it's totally relational and so then

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:13.840
 I think that's a big point for me it's relative self is there right like there's a functioning

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:18.720
 self yeah yeah we do function as a separate organism we just do

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:24.960
 that's why if a Buddha attains enlightenment doesn't mean all beings attain enlightenment

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:29.120
 or because our teachers might reach a certain level of realization doesn't mean that we reach

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:35.120
 that spontaneously that same level yeah that's what I was thinking to that important point

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:42.720
 but just like if you if visually in my mind if I think that like what is subject and object at the

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:50.800
 most basic level like they were saying here there's something here and then there's everything else

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:58.800
 in existence that's not this something here and that this it just it just necessarily posits

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:05.840
 something as independent singular and permanent you know like those those aspects like because

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:10.800
 there's this little finite body here and then there's this infinite everything else and they're

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:16.320
 totally separate you know and it's just like even though we might have that sense you know but it's

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:23.600
 like if you think about it it's just like it's just such a foolish view you know even at the level

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:23.760
 of

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:30.080
 like even at the strictly material level of oxygen exchange and molecules and electromagnetic

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:30.560
 fields

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:34.720
 and we came from our parents who came from their parents who came from their parents who came from

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:40.880
 their parents like just keeps going you know so to think that like all of a sudden we're here

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:47.760
 at this moment and it's like it's just this me and then there's everything else not me

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:53.760
 it's just like even just thinking about that it doesn't even make sense you know even our language

00:21:53.760 --> 00:22:01.600
 our culture our our worldviews those are all embedded in all these big cultural contexts

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:06.400
 like a deer doesn't perceive itself walking through the universe the way we perceive

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:11.840
 ourselves walking through the universe or the way a Buddha perceives everything as a display

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:16.320
 so then i have a question for you then so we're saying there is not a fixed sense of absolute

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:21.760
 self but there is a relative sense of self but here they're describing primordial nature as being

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:28.080
 uncompounded so how does uncompounded nature like how does that fit with having a relative nature

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:28.320
 too

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:37.680
 so that's a question how can it be uncompounded and relative i think even when you look at the

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:43.440
 sky you can see things fly through it and that's kind of a gross example you know even if there's

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:50.720
 that aspect that is you know spacious vast luminosity you know all these beautiful qualities

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:56.800
 there's still those those aspects that that kind of rise within it and you know if you particularly

00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:04.080
 with a human consciousness and faculty that there's an arc that gets traced you know and that

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:10.400
 that you can you can see because i mean just because you know everything um you know doesn't

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:15.120
 have a fixed self doesn't mean that that stops causes and conditions you know you're looking at

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:21.360
 that interdependence you're looking at how those things arise together still and so but even you

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:26.640
 know looking at that you still recognize okay you know yeah it arises together but even that

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:32.240
 still has that aspect where it came it's going to leave but they say the primordial nature's

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:40.000
 it doesn't but that's what i'm saying the relative quality comes and leaves but okay it's still at

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:47.760
 that base there's still that awareness there's still that luminosity where's that base why are

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:54.640
 you not going to find it it's the cloud this is the eye cloud i can't say that ever infinite eye

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:54.960
 cloud

00:23:54.960 --> 00:24:04.000
 it's in our heart right in light but isn't it still alive oh no i mean go ahead has the basis of

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:10.960
 you know pure pure alive or just the of those eight consciousnesses pure alive that there's

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:18.000
 movement or primordial nature that the nature of awareness is awareness i mean there's experience

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:25.600
 there is a way awareness happens or whatever you know beyond words but then as movement of that

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:34.160
 the the the different displays arise spontaneously from that and we can't do this real or take the

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:40.560
 most concept well what do you do or not i think that happens you know that you could gradually

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:47.600
 train so that you don't because not everything has sentience and see that's why i've always been

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:51.600
 a little confused on this because it seems like i know that the teachings say uncompounded but

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:59.920
 then they say wind but they say that the wind is it's always associated with awareness there's

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:11.280
 subtle wind so it seems like that subtle wind is material movement it's movement like a subtle

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:14.960
 they say it's like a subtle form it's like this i think they describe it more as speech if you

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:22.720
 have body speech in mind mind is this uncompounded intangible limitless awareness and speech is

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:23.040
 this

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:29.200
 arising quality or this knowing quality and then as it distills more and more and more tangible

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:36.400
 forms you have body so these more outer appearing objects it's appearances or objects tangible

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:42.240
 things that can be blocked or that block so wind is more that intangible it's like a semi-form

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:48.800
 not mind not body it's in between it's form or semi it's like semi-form or semi-mind or something

00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:54.480
 and so it's still it doesn't i mean as i've said before it's a subtle if you had a class that is

00:25:54.480 --> 00:26:00.160
 either being subjective awareness an objective subject an object it's like a really really

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:08.080
 subtle object but the object isn't a concrete entity it's movement so you can't say movement

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:13.360
 is a thing movement is what things do what they appear to do so where is uncompounded like

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:20.480
 it can't be grabbed it can't be pinpointed that's the crazy thing it is crazy so crazy

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:25.120
 isn't it it's so fantastic in terms of like that we were talking the other time about mystery and

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:29.920
 sort of magic i mean it's so magical isn't it that all this is appearing and yet it really

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:35.280
 doesn't have any true existence i mean it's incredible it's totally amazing you know that

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:39.520
 whole thing of the things because we do have this tendency to think that well either things exist

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:46.400
 or they don't exist do you know that you have to actually look into it do you know what i mean

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:50.560
 really really look and then you can start to see that like what you were talking about with

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:55.440
 relative level that it's this is the nature it's that there is this uncompounded nature

00:26:55.440 --> 00:27:02.000
 that is manifesting as all these relative things interesting too because particularly when you look

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.680
 at the relative it couldn't manifest without that absolute quality if there was an inherent quality

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:13.600
 to it there'd be no change they wouldn't be able to you know arise and fall you know because there

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:20.960
 would be that that status so you really start to see that indivisibility yes it's really it's just

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:25.760
 a mystery like you have the notion of the three kyas are always there together you know so you

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:31.920
 have that dharmakaya uncompounded you know awareness emptiness quality that's there

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:41.840
 within all the compounded stuff is there too it's really it's very mysterious yeah it's really

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:49.200
 and then you think about in the in the teachings you know how to say beginning with like we have

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:56.720
 been experiencing this display forever that's what the teachings say you know beyond concept

00:27:56.720 --> 00:28:06.400
 but i mean even in terms of past lives how many you know like the buddha oh one time i was this

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:12.720
 and that and this and that forever you know i mean it just keeps going he said even i look back and

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:19.760
 didn't see a beginning you know but just that notion of the continuity of the seeming in the

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:27.360
 world of time the seeming just continuity of experience it just keeps going like i think i

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:30.720
 mentioned one other time like robert throughman said when he translated the tibetan book of the

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:36.480
 dead he said oh i under i discovered something that maybe everybody else already knows there

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:46.320
 are no dead people we're all dead yeah don't freak out everybody it's like a dream you've heard

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:46.560
 this

00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:53.680
 before we all have a dream a bubble an illusion a movie a hallucination or we're all dead

00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:05.120
 but even the idea of being a person is yeah not yeah like if there's no life if life doesn't

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:10.240
 really have a you know a solidity then neither does death then neither does this space in between

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:16.160
 life and death it's just it is so magical you know you can see how when somebody wakes up i

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:20.400
 i think it is it seems like an appropriate metaphor like waking from a dream yes because

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:26.960
 it's like to really see the dream and know that the dream happened quote unquote but that it's

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:34.880
 just like not the way you think it did you know not the must be so interesting not in your box

00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:42.080
 it's not just your box version the way you thought was happening there's a lot more was actually

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:49.760
 involved yeah oh i just like to go back to just one other thing and some of what you were saying

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:55.680
 like i can't remember exactly where it filled it fit in but well just this the sense too that what

00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:59.920
 we really have to do overcome it the self and have kind of almost like the self won't withstand

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:04.160
 analysis but that it's just so important to really look into things whether you're doing

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:09.280
 it through an analytical way or trying to do it direct perception in your experience while you're

00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:15.680
 meditating but it seems like so much of what the the buddhist approach is is looking you know

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:24.080
 really looking into things you know really uh coming to know for yourself the way things are

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:28.400
 in terms of just all these things that you were saying that it's such a kind of crazy thing to

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:32.800
 even think that you could be totally separate and everything else is out there but if you really

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:37.840
 looked into it then you would realize it isn't that way but just the key thing of actually really

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:44.160
 looking i love that i know in the minyafika book it talks about that you know just the self

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:51.280
 doesn't stand up against real analysis you know you know yeah i love that yeah and that being a

00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:58.800
 definition of even relative truth right or that which is seemed solid with only when not examined

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:08.720
 and that also puts like the impetus or it's really on oneself because i mean we have the

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:14.800
 responsibility and the opportunity to investigate like it totally i mean just like we've heard so

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:20.160
 much that the buddha said the buddha can only show us the path but we have to walk it and it

00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:28.720
 really means that like a great master can't make us realize what we are like they can set up so

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:29.360
 many

00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:35.290
 wonderful auspicious conditions like an empowerment ceremony or like a some a direct kind of just

00:31:35.290 --> 00:31:35.440
 how

00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:40.400
 they can communicate with such skillful means but when it comes down to it our awareness has to

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:46.880
 recognize itself and that that's such a open door opportunity for all of us but it's also a great

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:53.440
 responsibility because that's we have this sense that although as individualistic as we might want

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:58.400
 to be it's i'm the creative force i'm the one that's going to do all this that no one's ever done

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:03.200
 or something all that you go with trip thing that so much of what we're trying to do is avoid

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:09.200
 responsibility when it comes down to it i want to do what i want but if something breaks like it

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:18.160
 wasn't me we're easy to blame or to move it but we want to take the full like the the credit we

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:23.760
 want the credit but not the blame and so it's interesting that opportunity that investigation

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:29.440
 poses or that like any scientific really thorough analysis poses that we have to look if we don't

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:34.640
 look it's our fault if we do look we get to reap the benefits of doing so too

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:42.160
 and especially once you hear the teachings and have access to the teachings and a teacher

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:49.920
 then this really is like here's a map you know you're trying to get to florida here's a map

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:56.480
 if you're trying to get an enlightenment here's also a map just go this way and then follow this

00:32:56.480 --> 00:33:01.920
 when you have this take a ride you know it's just like it's so like if you followed it you'll get

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:08.400
 there but you have to follow it which you have to follow it yeah yeah yeah yeah i know it deals

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:16.720
 with effort i just read that so that's a joyful part yeah joyful people go to the next i'll

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:20.720
 summarize a few of these other questions and i think lojo will read this other final talking

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:27.440
 point is that right um so the next um question someone asked the verbiage is what is the role

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:33.200
 of faith in attaining liberation they reply in buddhism faith is a combination of confidence

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:38.720
 and devotion you are confident in the truth of the teachings after hearing and studying them

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:44.160
 critically investigating them and applying them in your life to directly experience their validity

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:49.440
 liberation means when you have completely removed all of your suffering and confusion

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:55.040
 this happens within your own mind when you eliminate all of your mistaken ideas and habits

00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:57.360
 and have complete power over your own mind

00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:03.680
 so the next question is someone asked was the historical buddha buddha shakimuni the

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:08.640
 first person to become enlightened nirimache's reply no buddha shakimuni was not the first

00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:13.840
 enlightened being according to the mahayana teachings of the buddha the buddha taught that

00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:20.000
 there are thousands of mill i mean countless buddhas in every direction during our universe

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.680
 buddha shakimuni was the fourth buddha to reveal the complete path to enlightenment

00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:30.000
 every sentient being has buddha nature the seeder potential for enlightenment the absolute first

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:35.690
 buddha is the primordial nature of one's own mind which is sometimes called the true nature prim

00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:36.080
ordial

00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:42.880
 buddha of the original buddha then another question is someone asks is mindfulness the primordial

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:49.680
 nature rheumache's reply mindfulness is a technique that helps us discover the primordial nature

00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:56.880
 with effort we continually or continuously apply mindfulness of our body speech and mind which

00:34:56.880 --> 00:35:03.520
 helps us recognize their pure nature once we recognize their true nature effortless mindfulness

00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:08.480
 naturally arises from the mind just like sun beams naturally radiate from the sun

00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:15.920
 so with fabricated intentional mindfulness we discover our primordial nature which naturally

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:21.840
 arises as the limitless goodness qualities like natural spontaneous mindfulness that sees the

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:28.240
 true nature of oneself and all phenomena then the final question of the chapter i think lojo is

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:28.400
 going

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:36.320
 to read okay what is the relationship between zogchen and bodhichitta the zogchen teachings are

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:42.000
 the highest teachings of buddha shakimuni from the zogchen point of view everything is totally

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:42.320
 equal

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:47.920
 in one profound state without duality and distinctions zogchen is the ultimate view

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:54.240
 of the true nature of mind which includes love and compassion when we practice zogchen we develop

00:35:54.240 --> 00:36:00.080
 compassion and loving kindness zogchen practice cannot be separated from bodhichitta practice

00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:06.880
 we cannot ignore relative bodhichitta and accept absolute bodhichitta both are part of our true

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:13.200
 nature and both are part of zogchen for this reason before we meditate we take refuge and

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:18.480
 develop the flan of bodhichitta after we meditate we dedicate the merit to all sentient beings

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:23.600
 whenever we practice or do any kind of beneficial activity we should not cling to it

00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:30.800
 at the absolute level everything is totally pure and perfect in great emptiness from that point of

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:37.040
 view we are completely free from all dualistic concepts and clinging every person has the

00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:43.360
 enlightened nature but to actualize that nature is necessary to practice bodhichitta the love

00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:50.480
 and compassion for all beings bodhichitta is universally precious everybody appreciates it

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:56.080
 and everybody has the potential to develop it enlightenment is completely dependent upon

00:36:56.080 --> 00:37:01.360
 developing compassion for all beings the wish to obtain enlightenment for the benefit of others

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:08.080
 is the essence of both the maha yana and vajrayana paths when we develop inner wisdom we can take

00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:13.520
 care of all sentient beings and radiate compassion and kindness throughout the universe we can

00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:20.160
 discover the true nature of the mind and the entire world in order to be able to do this meditation

00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:26.720
 practice is very important bodhichitta is the root or the seed from which enlightenment develops

00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:33.680
 bodhichitta is not found externally but is within your own mind although all of us have experienced

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:41.840
 love and compassion these qualities need to be developed further page 100 last paragraph page 101

00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:53.040
 the first and second paragraphs beautiful it's like a clear bell just like it's just like

00:37:53.040 --> 00:38:00.560
 pure and clear and clean and pervasive and just uplifting to hear and soothing and

00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:07.200
 it's really beautiful it's just i mean there's so much they said there but one thing i know is just

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:12.320
 sorry um just just looking at the whole it seemed like he talked about bodhichitta a little bit

00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:12.640
 more

00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:23.360
 looking at it seem like so what do you mean because i said zuchen is is bodhichitta

00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:26.800
 so then how did they talk about bodhichitta more than zuchen i don't know it just seems

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:32.880
 like it's a difference or something you're saying well i guess i don't know just from my own

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:37.440
 you know filter it seemed like maybe you was talking about bodhichitta

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:41.520
 are you thinking of zuchen as maybe a technique

00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:52.000
 just a word yeah or maybe maybe he just didn't want to um talk about zuchen maybe wanted to talk

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:58.720
 more about bodhichitta maybe um maybe because a lot of people like to go to zuchen you know

00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:05.440
 and maybe you maybe wanted to take a bodhichitta ladder i don't know i don't know really but it

00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:09.920
 just seemed like he talked about bodhichitta a little bit more like you know because saying

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:18.720
 you know it is it it does it is it does cause enlightenment yeah i think it's like maybe we

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:23.600
 have a ten most people have a tendency to think of zuchen as absolute bodhichitta and what he's

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:28.160
 trying to do here is kind of emphasize that the relative is really a part of it too yeah he said

00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:33.760
 both yeah and so exactly how would somebody say that the relative bodhichitta really fits into

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:40.960
 the zuchen it is the natural rating radiating qualities of awareness when your mind is totally

00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:48.960
 balanced and not grasping in any mistaken way that that it's knowing radiating qualities are

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:55.840
 naturally loving compassionate just like they said at the end of this first um sorry this first

00:39:55.840 --> 00:40:00.400
 section sometimes this is called rigpo rigpo is the innermost true nature of the mind our awareness

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:05.840
 which is fresh uncom pounded and very open so that's the absolute bodhichitta part then they

00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:11.200
 say along with emptiness rigpo contains clarity loving kindness wisdom and skillful means the

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:20.080
 relative bodhichitta part always together yeah yeah just in terms of what dylan was pointing out

00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:23.360
 i don't think it's that they didn't want to talk about zuchen here i think they've already talked

00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:30.000
 about it so much in this book that they were emphasizing more how does the bodhichitta part

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:38.800
 fit in so yeah that's good that's very helpful in terms of seeing that that you know previous

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:46.720
 discussion of zuchen is broken down into these two aspects so relative and absolute bodhichitta

00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:55.280
 one of the reasons reasons too we might have been articulating more about bodhichitta it's

00:40:55.280 --> 00:41:00.560
 really particularly the ways he's talked about you know going back through the the paragraphs

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:06.240
 it really becomes the the fuel not only the motivation but the practice of you know it's

00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:13.680
 really that foundation path and realization you know so it's if you if you have that that

00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:20.080
 motivation of that bodhichitta that's a you know a lot of the zuchen is is already there you know

00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:26.480
 i mean but i'm not just saying like you know oh i i have a nice hallmark feeling kind of you know

00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:33.520
 like i'm gonna give someone a card to you know as much as you know like that real you know that

00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:38.960
 that aspiration to benefit all 17 beings and all of your actions all your words you know all your

00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:44.480
 thoughts just arising for the you know that that real desire to liberate with you know with with

00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:53.920
 true wisdom true compassion you know yeah i mean like he says the i mean i mean he's talking about

00:41:53.920 --> 00:42:01.200
 ninja but yeah as it being the launch pad you know to maybe these higher states if you see it from

00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:06.640
 that way and even nundra i mean i think it's really good just just to emphasize this i'm so

00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:11.600
 glad which is did this and it's so profound that just really there's always a relative aspect and

00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:17.440
 an absolute aspect like you mentioned nundra nundra has an outer inner innermost and absolute

00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:22.960
 level of each section there's always an absolute part there's always a relative part that relative

00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:28.960
 part always has degrees of subtlety the outermost relative the innermost relative and then

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:29.520
 absolutely

00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:33.840
 like totally beyond and limitless so we have certain things we hear that we tend to want

00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:38.560
 we hold them in a certain way because they seem like they're like rungs on the ladder that were

00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:44.800
 used to finally be free you know but like i mean that's just seen when we're holding onto things

00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:49.120
 more as if we're going to eventually get to a place that's not holding and then there's just

00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:54.480
 going to not be things anymore but they're really clearly saying that those radiating qualities

00:42:54.480 --> 00:43:00.240
 come even more even i mean it's even like when they describe in the tantra it's just like

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:05.280
 the intricacy if they're on the relative level the view of the buddha they're on their omniscience

00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:10.080
 that relative side of the omniscience and their absolute side the relative side sees endless

00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:16.720
 degrees of subtlety both subtly small and subtly big and it's all yeah seen purely without mistake

00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:21.440
 i mean you see so much more of the relative from the enlightened perspective according to the

00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:26.960
 tantras and the sutras i mean the amitabhas pure land and all these describe that quite a lot in

00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:34.400
 the sutras too it's just good that it's emphasizing that that absolute realization includes

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:34.880
 everything

00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:41.680
 even it says it includes duality here like uh on the absolute level it says from that viewpoint

00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:47.280
 we're completely free from all dualistic concepts and clinging so free from dualistic concepts and

00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:54.160
 clinging but these concepts happen when we cling but duality or like having a sense of objects out

00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:59.360
 there or maybe the out there is not there but a sense of objects and subject is still there for

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:05.840
 enlightened beings let it really clearly say it there's dharmakat there's a you say that's why

00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:12.000
 there's pure relative truth and absolute truth the pure relative truth is the appearances the

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:20.960
 radiating qualities so it's never that it all just fizzles into blankness you know and i think too

00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:26.160
 like along the same lines when sometimes it seems like we have an idea of an enlightened being

00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:35.040
 as someone who's just like an uncaring removed always still never smiling you know what i mean

00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:45.360
 yeah he's like somewhere else like in this state of like you know total nothingness almost and we

00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:50.320
 it seems like we have that you have zogchen too but then you think of like tara all these different

00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:56.960
 buddhas they always say that what is the nature of those loving compassionate of course they know

00:44:56.960 --> 00:45:04.300
 sentient beings don't really exist as like a solid sentient being but the sentient beings that don

00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:04.400
't

00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:10.800
 exist think they exist so you know what i mean it's just like i i think it's so important like

00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:16.160
 what you were saying too and that level of like so many of these teachers like they say when they

00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:20.240
 talk about their teachers or when they think of bodhicitta or when they think of suffering or

00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:26.560
 sentient being they just start crying the highest masters of male and female there's so many if you

00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:32.400
 read any bio all these biographies does that mean that they're diluted and have no you know like

00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:38.480
 don't understand the view of zogchen or does that mean and that that outreaching qualities of their

00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:44.730
 understanding is just like because they know there's no samsara you know yeah and then practice

00:45:44.730 --> 00:45:45.200
 more

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:50.880
 yeah and they study more yeah and they do more things i mean really and they're just totally

00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:56.800
 aligned you know they're just like they're in a dream they made the dream into a perfect dream

00:45:56.800 --> 00:46:04.640
 but other people in their dream don't see it that way from their side so it's just so important

00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:10.960
 because otherwise you think it's just you can use practice to escape you can just use the dharma to

00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:17.600
 escape i think it's a big escape escape from experience escape from feeling and all these

00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:24.320
 things and it's just like towing not the right way to use the dharma dharma goes deeper inward you

00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:31.760
 know it doesn't try to like hold everything at a distance you know temporarily we do like

00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:38.720
 lessen distraction yeah so we just because that's practical we need to not be around all the stuff

00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:44.800
 that causes us to strongly habitually react so we temporarily do remove or distance or so we're not

00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:50.320
 just immediately jumping with our habits but like it's always always in the end you come you know

00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:56.640
 you go back into the marketplace or whatever there's that re-engagement in a pure clear wisdom way

00:46:57.200 --> 00:47:02.800
 like it's always makes you more engaged i mean just from the examples like you said life stories

00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:09.600
 and the and also the philosophy of it is it it agrees and the whole form is emptiness and

00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:14.720
 emptiness is foreign thing it doesn't matter how high a realization is that manifests

00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:22.640
 in a relational way you know for a union of the kind it's like ann was saying it's not just some

00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:28.800
 you know that's why the dharmakai rubakai the rubakai is the expressive

00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:33.360
 appearing aspect of the dharmakai

00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:42.800
 appearance and emptiness all right ross you got anything to say well i think it may be about time

00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:56.880
 yeah there's still time might be time but there's still time so this has really been like the this

00:47:56.880 --> 00:48:00.960
 is so this is the final discussion it's the final chapter of this book and the buddhist path by the

00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:07.040
 venerable kenba rama chase and so really of course thanks everyone here and he's everyone who's

00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:07.200
 been

00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:13.600
