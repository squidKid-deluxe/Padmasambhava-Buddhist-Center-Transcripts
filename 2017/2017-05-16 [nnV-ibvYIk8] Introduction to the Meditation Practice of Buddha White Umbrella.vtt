00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 White Umbrella or Tuk Tuk Tuk Sardok Ba Chimo, also known as Dokkar, Pyomdi, Dema, Dokkarna.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.560
 And again, before we begin, this ceremony and part of the ceremony, as many of you already know,

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.000
 this introduction.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 The introduction is a reminding of how important, how precious this teaching is.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 And as well as also ourself, or yourself, how important, how precious, how these beautiful

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 opportunities,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.710
 which kind of enlighten me in all these beautiful colleges that are inherent in our nature, bring

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.000
 up to the full bloom status.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.110
 And together with this, again, then connected to the divine and other of the Dorgi, Tuk Tuk Sardok

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.000
 Ba Chimo, or Pyomdi, Dema, Dokkarna.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 And again, I'm going to tell now, and I will be able to tell afterwards, and this is, again,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.570
 we stand in our beautiful motivation of the bodhicitta, and as well as we really understand the

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.000
 nature of the mind.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 Mind and nature of all these phenomena exist in that which is so important.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 And first, the bodhicitta, again, you all know the bodhicitta, is kindness and compassion,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 and support with it, selfishness, selfishness, greedless, thought, thinking of all sent beings,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 the wish them best, good, happiness.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.500
 And I'm doing also this, taking part of this ceremony, wish that become the great cause to break

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.000
 your peace, happiness.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 Now, in a continually that way, and then become the enlightenment of the Buddha,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 which means free from the suffering, difficulty, troubles, full of joy and peace, happiness.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 And that is what really means, the Buddha.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 So, we give all those best, best thought.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.110
 And then, same time, then again, we already understand the nature of the mind, nature of the

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.000
 phenomena,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 because this teaching and the involvement we're taking this part is vedayana teaching.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 Vedayana teaching is not just a regular thing, a mundane status.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 It is a teaching of beyond of the mundane status as duality conceptions.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 Bring up full bloom, the natural status, and that is what it is.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 And that's why we're going to connect to also this white umbrella,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 because white umbrella, the nature of what we're going to visualize is also beyond the conceptual,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 beyond the duality is a kind of almost unimaginable state of the realization and meditating

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 that we're going to take that place.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 So, therefore, so mundane duality conception is not exactly where we connected that.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 So, therefore, and to really be strong, kind of be courageous, be openness,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 and then without any intellectual and kind of like thinking this and that and all these things,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 and just jump right in the state of the vedayana, vedayana in this great secret teaching, mandala.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 And that is how we're going to embrace this empowerment and a rigid empowerment.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 And now with that understanding, again, we talk a little bit about the white umbrella.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 And white umbrella is generally is a Buddha, totally enlightened beings, absolutely Buddha.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 And he appeared in this world as he said yesterday when Buddha Shakyamuni meditated,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 and in the Kolonchakra meditation known as I'm going to read this text,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 which is where I mean just part of this text as introduction.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 And in the teaching here said, this is when Buddha moment once upon the time,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 or once I heard this teaching, that moment, the Buddha Shakyamuni,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 who is residing in a Tushid heaven, right in front of the palace of the Indira,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 the king of the gods Indira, and there is the big gathering of the old Sangha members,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 olden monks and nuns, and as well as great bodhisattvas.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 Together with Indira came Indira, the gods came.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 Buddha gathered with that and sitting right there.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 And that moment, the Indira put was set up the throne to the Buddha.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 And Buddha set on that throne, moment he set that throne,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 Buddha entered in the Samadhi known as beholding the Unishika, the Kolonchakra,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 the exploring and discovering of the Kolonchakra status.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 And moment Buddha entered in that kyaka status, that moment,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 then this great Buddha, the white umbrella,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 he appeared with full bloom power, full bloom majesty,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 dignity, splendor qualities, that will completely destroy all the negative ideas,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 no obscurations and obstacles.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 Moment he entered that that was diverse, reverse all those negative ideas.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 At the same time, the voice came simultaneously,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 pay homage to the Buddha, pay homage to the Dharma,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:55.000
 pay homage to the Sangha, pay homage to the millions,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 millions and millions of the bodhisattva enlightened beings,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 pay homage to the old bodhisattvas and aharas,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 and great, great, great enlightened beings

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 and great bodhisattva who completely embodies the full loving kindness

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 to all the certain beings.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 And these words came simultaneously and he appeared full bloom status.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 Full bloom state of this, then I will talk later,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 and many of you know practicing the white umbrella,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 he is many, many like emanations.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 He appeared in that form, that form in many different forms

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 and many different gestures and many different colors and formations

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 that all came, came.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
 And this is what great this white umbrella is,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 a white dog garden.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 And then he reversed all the negative ideas

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 and obscurations and obstacles as I said.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 See, so this is the white umbrella.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 Now, white umbrella also can be,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 of course I can talk more these things tomorrow,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 it is hard than that, but that's how he appeared right there

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 and then full bloom of this whole, this certain teaching.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 This is the entire, the certain teaching of this white umbrella

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 where all this different sadness emerged by those great masters.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
 Sadness are known as then condensate

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 and more practical instructions of these practices.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 So this is the white umbrella.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 And now, again, he can be understanding,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
 standing and discover three different ways.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 Those are known as then dharmakaya, sambokaya

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 and dharmakaya in light beams.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 Sambokaya and dharmakaya and sambokaya

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 and dharmakayas are the different categories of the enlightenment,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000
 qualities that we can discover and explore these natures.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 This is not that the Buddha divided that division

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 in order to make karulek difficult to perceive these enlightened qualities.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 But rather our capabilities, according our capabilities,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 readiness and then we can perceive these three different levels of the Buddhas.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
 For example, we are highly enlightened beings,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 same as the Buddha, Buddha Shaktamuni and Gaurabhema Sambok.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 We can perceive then white umbrella as dharmakaya Buddhas.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 Dharmakaya Buddha is beyond the conceptions,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 beyond the imagination, the imagination.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 And beyond any categories,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 it's just only the realization through realization

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 or mid-realization through realization.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 Merged as one central state without any division

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 and without any distractions.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 And fully understand that natural, realize that natural.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
 And that is known as dharmakaya Buddha of the very white umbrella.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 And he is then known as the Buddha Sambodha Badris and the Pandya Palamutas.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 Those are all known as the dharmakaya nature, dharmakaya of the white umbrella.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 Now again, to perceive this dharmakaya Buddha,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 we have to be as totally enlightened beings as Buddha Shaktamuni,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 as Meru Gaurabhema Sambodha, as only all of those Buddhas.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
 That's how we can discover, connect to this Buddha.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 That means also we are going to discover dharmakaya Buddha

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
 and the makaya Buddha too.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 It's not just we are only going to perceive dharmakaya Buddhas.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 When you have the high realization,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 you can experience the full quality of the Buddha's nature,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.000
 natural enlightenment qualities without left any mysteries

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 or we don't left anything that we discover complete that nature.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 And that is known as the dharmakaya Buddha.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 As I said, Sambodha Badri and Sambodha Sambodha Badri

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
 as well as the Pandya Palamutas Naturals.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 And then when we have the realization such as great bodhisattvas,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 great bodhisattva realization as Bhumi, 10th Bhumi bodhisattva Realizations.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 And that means we remove a lot of obstacles and negativities, duality, graspings.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000
 And we have that realization, we can discover Sambodh Gaya,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 nature of the mother, white umbrella or the white umbrella.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 This is known as then, white umbrella herself is also Sambodh Gaya nature.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
 Sambodh Gaya nature state of the white umbrella.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 And as well as then the five dhyana buddha, the female buddhas,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
 those are all known as then that the dharmakaya,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
 the nature of the mother, white umbrella.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
 And then as well as often in the teachings said,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 also Vaidyavarais is known as the Sambodh Gaya nature.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
 The nature of the white umbrella and white umbrella herself

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 and life as nakini and sattva.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 And Vaidyayogini is many times also mentioned as Vaidyayogini.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 Those all are known as then the Sambodh Gaya mother, white umbrella.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000
 Again to discover full realization, full call of this Sambodh Gaya nature,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 we have to be as realization similar as like great bodhisattvas.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 At 10th, 9th Bhumi bodhisattva then we can experience in full,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000
 not just experience, we can see exactly these great beings

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 because we are ready to experience and contract or realize these natures

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
 because it is beyond the duality.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
 Pretty much it is really beyond the duality

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
 because the duality mind cannot proceed and comprehends

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:03.000
 or can fit or can adjust this nature completely.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
 Therefore, it is beyond the most duality status.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
 And then when we have the kind of duality status,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:17.000
 then we can also experience it again known as then the Narmakaya Buddhas.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 These Narmakaya Buddhas as most times like 21 emanations of Madadara

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
 open in the teachings said the Narmakaya Buddhas

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 and as well as so forth like Vasranakini, Shimsodas,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 Matic Lovers and so forth, those all known as Narmakaya Buddhas

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
 and as well as then also the renowned Narmakaya Buddhas

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
 and male Buddhas such as the Buddha Shaktamuni, Gauravayama Sambod.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
 They are the Narmakaya Buddhas because this in Narmakaya Buddhas

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 can be perceived with duality beings

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 and that is how the Buddhas appear in order to benefit that.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 So, this is to understand these three Gaya Buddhas

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 according to our realization level

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
 or according to the compassion and kindness level of the Buddhas

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 can appear in these three different ways.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 And Buddhas are again to benefit all certain beings

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 and therefore then Buddhas also emanate in the three different ways

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
 to communicating, to helping, to guiding to them

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 known as the Narmakaya Sambod Gaya, Narmakaya

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000
 or according to our realization when we put contract to these three Gayas.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
 And then again when we are heavily obstacle time

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
 we can communicate, contract with them

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 and full benefit and all that is then the Narmakaya Buddhas.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 And then we know quite high realization beings

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
 such as great Bodhisattva, known as the Sambod Gaya Buddhas

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 then known as we know fully enlightened beings

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
 again full experience and realization

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 and that is known as then the Darmakaya Buddhas.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 So, there is three different ways to understand

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 this Darmakaya Buddha

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 and again mother white umbrella

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
 she is embodying man of all three Gaya Buddhas

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 not just only Buddha and as I said

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 said in this chapter in the teaching said

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 she is embodying man of hundreds millions of the Buddhas

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 she embodies, embodies all those Buddhas

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 and all those are in way her emanations

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 she is the mother of all the Buddhas

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 in the past, present and in the future

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 and that is the mother, mother white umbrella

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
 and he is then again in a simple way known as

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
 is the emanation of the mother Tara

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000
 Tara or the one of the 21 emanation of the Tara

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000
 according that is according present 21 words to the Tara

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 she is the native, native emanation

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 of that when you read the text

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 and again there is very beautiful commentary

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 by Ken Kipadhe Sheeramaji

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000
 it is not just beautiful

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
 I think this is one of the extra only commentaries

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 that exist in our, really

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 there is not many commentaries on the Tara

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
 Tara, meaning of 21 words of Tara

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
 such as, as Ken Kipadhe Sheeramaji is commentary

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 it is quite unique

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 I mean so far what we see

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
 many great teachers make

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 and there is not really many commentaries like this

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.000
 and so this is so far

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
 I mean maybe there is something

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 is hiding because in the community

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
 there is so many great masters came one after another

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
 but their teachings and works are also kind of in a way

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 we lost it in a kind of like in the somewhere, in a corner

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 and in ancient times there is many, many

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 not many copies can write, only handwriting

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
 so there is not really distributed well

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 and that could be something they exist in

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
 but otherwise, personally

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 what you can find there is not really

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 like such this commentary

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 as Ken Kipadhe Sheeramaji

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
 so in this, in that verse

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 is the, I think the ancient

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 is the, that phrase to the white umbrella

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 so again, he is, the white umbrella

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
 is the embodiment of all the Buddhas

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
 of the three times

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 the birth of the old Buddhas

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000
 she is the most powerful, renowned, great, great Buddha

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000
 that removed all the obstacles

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000
 negativities, curse, black maggots

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
 all such as known as ant fields

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 such as fields from the water

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
 or fire from the different elements

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
 and as well as kings and lords

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
 and cooked sources, bird omens

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
 black maggots and nightmares

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000
 anything that really been distributed to us

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
 for the peace of the mind and happiness

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 and he is very powerful, is a renowned once

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 and as a great master, Chiang Mooji

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
 the great master Chiang Mooji said

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
 this is the most powerful practices

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
 that even when you practice, practice this

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
 then no matter what, there is no matter

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
 any kind of hurt you

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
 or no matter how much they are powerful

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 how much they are strong, they cannot hurt you

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
 it is like wearing the Vedara armor

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
 armor to yourself

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
 that can protect every, every problem

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
 every fields in the samsara

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
 that's what the great master Chiang Mooji said

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000
 in this text, which is translated roughly in here

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
 so you can read that

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
 I mean this is really the full benefit of that

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000
 and this is also a renowned practices in the

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 old to be the Buddhism

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000
 and this teaching of course came from

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 taught by the Buddha as you see

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 this is also known as, of course, Varyana teaching

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000
 among the Varyana teaching, this is

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 there is outer tantra and inner tantra

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 this teaching is known as then

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
 the outer tantras, but again is the outer tantra

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
 with many great masters, and Gopi Maesambhava

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
 or those great master as combined

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000
 together with outer tantra

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
 with inner tantra

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
 so outer tantra, inner tantra

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000
 teaching, both are combined in this

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 this teaching and joined as very special

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000
 so this is what this teaching is
