00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.400
 Just stand up. I just thought to tell, today we are doing, trying, I mean, drawing the ground

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.720
 black in a way, picking up the the spot of the beautiful stupa, the upcoming. And this stupa,

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:23.600
 we had envisioned and we hope so long since 1985, the same time we are building the Sangha house.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.000
 That time, many Sangha members are supporting help and donating money,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.280
 and Makkaduna made beautiful stupa model, a small one, to raise a pond for this.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.840
 And however, it is not exactly enough to really start it immediately. But after that, or soon after

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.760
 at the same time, so many beautiful projects are coming one after another, coming up, and all those

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.080
 are fulfilled by the Sangha members to support, as you all know. And now, again, we taught this,

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.840
 after entering the Mahaparin nirvana, Kirmuchi, we taught to build this stupas. But again,

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:06.560
 have so many beautiful projects in his honor and memories of many great masters and the Sangha

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.590
 members. Again, support of the many Sangha members, we completed, we are completing now. And we're

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.800
 so

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:19.520
 grateful and thankful to all your support and help throughout all these things. And now,

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:26.080
 these projects came out, we thought to do this, but then again, it's not just kind of how to start,

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.820
 we always had a little bit of kind of hesitation. We started, we couldn't have enough, maybe we

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.880
 have

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.400
 to stay for a long time or stop for a long time and all those thoughts. But then again, the

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:36.960
 blessings

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:44.320
 of the Mahasambhava and all the enlightened beings, and suddenly, one of the very devotees came up

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:50.720
 and mentioned that anonymously, for at least for a while, for anonymously to support this project.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:57.360
 And I was like, what they call it, I was blown away, blown away for a while. And even that time,

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.440
 I said, oh, thank you very much, maybe I will start when, ask me when you think so. But maybe

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:09.840
 this fall or sometimes maybe early next spring, all these things. But then, I thought last week,

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.320
 but Sangha members are all here, here, and many members are coming. And also, a beautiful time,

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.360
 timing was today, the turning wheel of Dharma. And this Stupa is representative of that very

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.600
 monument. And therefore, then I thought, why we wait? Why should we wait? It must be really

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:33.600
 started soon, and do that, at least we should start it. And then I mentioned that to immediately

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.800
 learn, she thought that's great. And as well, then our Sangha members and everybody thought that's

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.560
 wonderful. And so, that's what we are really starting with this, right this time. And I'm so

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.240
 thankful and so grateful that donors and all those you donated the money and supported,

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:56.160
 we have that money. So, we're going to add that with this point. And together, whatever the

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:02.970
 contribution comes, we put add that and make this one with a very beautiful, glorious Stupa in

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:03.360
 honor

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.750
 of all the great Masters. And as well as also our such beautiful, many Sangha members who passed

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:10.080
 away,

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:15.040
 and particularly donors such a great Dharma patron, Bell Herman. And their memories, really, we're

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:21.040
 going to build this to Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, and past and present and the future. We're going to

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.240
 build this. And I think it's going to come so beautifully. And I'm so thankful and so grateful

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:32.720
 to all of your supporters. This is what is blooming now, going to bloom. And so, thank you. This is

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.480
 what we're doing today here. And thank you. Thank you very much everyone. And now, Loser La Iveda

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:38.720
 is

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:47.520
 also really supporting us. And all those drums are beaded. So, the drums are beaded. And now,

00:03:47.520 --> 00:04:02.880
 we will beat our drums. Thank you everyone. Thank you. And I try. And also, this blue print, this

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:03.040
 blue

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:11.840
 print is actually really like, like, look so many times. And Bell Herman and many Sangha members

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:18.400
 look. And we designed this. We thought to build the Doll of the Aspicious, of the open the Doll

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:24.160
 of the Aspicious, which is a symbol of the teaching, symbol of the Dharma. That is the today, the

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:24.320
 turn

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:30.960
 and the will of Dharma. So, this blue print that we made, I think maybe 12, 15, 13 years ago,

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:40.160
 long time ago. And then, it's just been as a sleeping beauty. Today is waking up. So, thank you.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.400
 And even I really forget to have this blue print. Actually, myself forget that and have to talk to

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.440
 make this have to blue print. I thought how we can do now. I made all this thought. And then,

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:59.520
 suddenly came up. Blue print is really, and Patek did this. Patek did. And we put thought to put,

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:05.280
 there's many dolls. The dolls and thought to put the Buddhas inside each of those. Those,

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.800
 those are the kind of, we thought. And the kingdom would you look. And Bill looked. And many Sangha

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:17.680
 members look to watch. And we all discussed. And this is really true. It's the old one.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.600
 One and we put them. So, thank you.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:48.240
