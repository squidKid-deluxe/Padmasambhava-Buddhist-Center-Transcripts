 And then we start with the seven-line prayer.

00:07:52.960 --> 00:08:12.880
 And then we start with the seven-line prayer.

 And then we start with the seven-line prayer.

00:09:52.480 --> 00:10:12.400
 And then we start with the seven-line prayer.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:26.320
 And then we start with the seven-line prayer.

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:54.240
 And then we start with the seven-line prayer.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:11:22.000
 And then we start with the seven-line prayer.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:43.760
 And then we start with the seven-line prayer.

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:57.520
 And then we start with the seven-line prayer.

00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:11.520
 And then we start with the seven-line prayer.

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:35.280
 And then we start with the seven-line prayer.

00:12:35.280 --> 00:13:01.040
 And then we start with the seven-line prayer.

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:26.800
 And then we start with the seven-line prayer.

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:52.560
 And then we start with the seven-line prayer.

00:13:52.560 --> 00:14:17.520
 And then we start with the seven-line prayer.

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:44.480
 And then we start with the seven-line prayer.

00:14:44.480 --> 00:15:13.440
 And then we start with the seven-line prayer.

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:40.400
 And then we start with the seven-line prayer.

00:15:40.400 --> 00:16:07.360
 And then we start with the seven-line prayer.

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:34.320
 And then we start with the seven-line prayer.

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:57.280
 And then we start with the seven-line prayer.

00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:03.280
 And then we start with the seven-line prayer.

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:17.120
 And then we start with the seven-line prayer.

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:44.960
 And then we start with the seven-line prayer.

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:57.760
 And then we start with the seven-line prayer.

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:09.760
 And then we start with the seven-line prayer.

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:16.910
 And it is all not just created by someone, but it is displayed in the creation of one's own

00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:17.600
 activity

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:21.600
 that's reflecting back to us as like a dream.

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:24.400
 No one is creating a dream to us.

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.240
 We are all dreaming.

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:28.080
 It's our dream.

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:29.440
 We created.

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:30.560
 We dreaming.

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:32.080
 We experiencing.

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:33.920
 We are again analyzing.

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:36.160
 We're kind of sorting out all that.

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:37.600
 So it's the same thing.

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:40.000
 That's what the gracious teacher said.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:40.640
 See that.

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:44.240
 So today, again, we follow the teaching of the gracious teacher.

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:52.800
 And therefore, always in the teaching emphasize how to correct or reactivate in the motivations.

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:56.320
 Motivation is our mind, your mind.

00:18:56.320 --> 00:19:03.760
 Because Dharma is practicing and Dharma is all best upon the mind, not outside anything.

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:07.120
 It's our mind, your mind, my mind.

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:16.240
 So if we like to make this Dharma practice as nice and beautiful and beneficial to me

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:20.800
 and to you as well as other beings, then let's begin.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:23.120
 We start with our mind.

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:29.920
 Mind is the starting point of our journey of whatever we like to take.

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:36.880
 Journey where we like to go through the beautiful, peaceful, smooth,

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:40.080
 and rewarding journey we like to take.

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.200
 We don't care.

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:44.800
 Maybe we don't really like or maybe you don't care too much.

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:48.000
 Whatever the situation, I don't want to do anything.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.440
 That one, let's go with this mind.

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:54.160
 Let's do what mind decided.

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:59.360
 If we do that, then what mind will decide?

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:04.000
 That is what we're going to talk to them, to a little bit about mind.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.280
 Our nature of the mind, our nature and everyone's nature is so beautiful.

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:17.280
 So nice and beautiful, pristine, clear and rich and really beautiful according to the

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:20.720
 teaching of the great teacher Bodhaka Kamanipa.

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:26.960
 But its nature of the mind is neutral, openness, like sky.

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:30.800
 There's no different restrictions and this and that.

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:37.680
 Whatever reflecting from the mind, then we follow with that.

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:43.040
 Most of the time, we human beings or we live sentient beings

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:51.520
 following the way the reflection of the mind started with our own habit of patterns.

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:54.960
 Habit of patterns, then we follow.

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:57.360
 And that way, then what?

00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:04.720
 When we follow it that way, it will be distracted ourselves more externally, all externally.

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:06.800
 What that means externally?

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:13.440
 We're more distracted by the five sensorial objects.

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:16.880
 Sensorial five objects, what are those?

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:22.960
 The object of "I", our "I" is poems.

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:30.640
 We're more attracted with the object of the "I", like object of the song.

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:37.520
 We're more attracted or we kind of follow with the song.

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:46.560
 Then object of the nose is smell and object of the tongue consciousness is taste.

00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:51.120
 And the body is touch.

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:56.240
 So those are known as five sensual objects.

00:21:56.240 --> 00:22:00.160
 Those are, we are operating.

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:08.160
 Then the mind senses is called the sixth sense in Buddhism.

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:12.480
 First five are the external operating.

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:23.840
 Mind sense is operating inwardly whatever the experience we got from the five senses.

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:26.240
 The mind is decided.

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:32.160
 The five senses are only on the present.

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:35.920
 They don't have capability to judge of the past.

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:39.680
 They don't have capability to judge the future.

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:42.240
 And only the present.

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:50.080
 The mind, the sixth consciousness, that has the capability of perceiving the past, perceiving

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:53.920
 the future and as well as the present.

00:22:53.920 --> 00:23:02.320
 So we are completely distracted externally, now all the time, mostly.

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:10.240
 Maybe I will say 80%, 90% we are distracted or attracted externally.

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:20.000
 Among that, when we are extracted, what we like most of the time, we are completely collect

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.800
 the word we like to please.

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:31.680
 The pleasing poems, pleasing song, pleasing smell, pleasing taste, pleasing touch.

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:34.160
 That's what really we like all the time.

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:40.880
 And we are completely against it with the opposite of that, unpleasing.

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:47.840
 Then we met big divisions between pleasing and not pleasing.

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:51.120
 Who met that?

00:23:51.120 --> 00:24:00.560
 Not by the eyes, not by the ears, not by the nose and the tongues and the body consciousness.

00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:06.320
 It's by mind, mind beside it.

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:11.120
 And mind did, and that's what we follow.

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:17.520
 So we are all externally, really kind of, attracted externally.

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:26.160
 And when we look to that, that, how much time we spend it to pursue of the pleasing things

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:32.160
 or trying to also disregard the not pleasing things.

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:36.200
 That is in Buddhism called hope and fears.

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:43.600
 We continually follow and challenge by the hope and fears.

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:48.500
 So we are following this, what we like to please or get, trying to get that and get

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:57.840
 just really the every time we spend whatever, time we born, take the birth, time we lived

00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:03.560
 this world, we just really following that most of the time.

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:06.960
 And then because up and down, all that.

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:12.180
 So all spending time externally, most of the time.

00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:18.120
 That is also so easy for us because our habit patterns.

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:20.840
 We don't have to make pause.

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:25.200
 We don't have to make joyful effort for that.

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:27.480
 It's naturally flowing.

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:29.520
 We don't have any effort.

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:35.320
 So up and down as we follow it, just like to do.

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:40.920
 But then really thinking of that activity, what we do, it's not just really like, only

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:46.960
 duration of where we're living here on this planet.

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:59.240
 Maybe we live 80 years, 60 years, 80 years, maybe that, the longest maybe 90 years or

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:03.120
 95 or 100 that is.

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:11.440
 So all that activity what we did, externally following and trying to kind of make the comfortable

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:20.560
 that please our mind if I use the symbol word or other word we call ego clinging.

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:26.960
 So important, self-centered mind trying to please that we've been working for that.

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:34.400
 Well we're working that even 100% or 80%, 90%, we're spending time for that.

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:37.760
 We're not always fulfilling that goal.

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:40.220
 Not everything so smooth.

00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:42.460
 Not everything so comfortable.

00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:47.000
 Not everything is coming according to our desires.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.200
 That happened.

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:54.100
 And then it's all, so many things go up and down and all that.

00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:56.480
 But that is not only the life.

00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:00.240
 That is not only the mind according to Buddhism.

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:05.640
 There's a more deeper meaning of the mind, deeper nature of the mind but we don't really

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:09.280
 pay attention.

00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:15.640
 We always look, as I said, you think, I'm not just saying that, you think how much do

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:18.080
 I spend the time?

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:27.080
 What we're discussing now in my life until now, spend the time.

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:32.160
 And we don't think any kind of other things but other side of the mind is called then

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:33.160
 practicing.

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:38.040
 Practicing Dharma.

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:46.120
 The practicing Dharma is not something strange things we are trying to apply to our mind.

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:56.520
 Practicing Dharma means bring out the natural beauty of our richness of the mind.

00:27:56.520 --> 00:28:09.340
 Our kindness, our compassion, our joy, our appreciation, our happiness, peace, respect

00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:12.760
 and stay calm and peaceful.

00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:19.160
 And we're to the present state of the nature of the mind.

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:21.640
 But how much we do that?

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:27.520
 We really think ourself.

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:32.040
 This is not what I said, it is not alien, not strange, not dogma, not something that

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:34.440
 I'm talking different things.

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:38.400
 That is what in the Buddha's teaching, the gracious teacher, Buddha teaching, touching

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:45.000
 to your own treasures, you're revealing that treasure.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:53.160
 This treasure never, every level of this treasure never going to leave us when we depart from

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:55.480
 this world.

00:28:55.480 --> 00:29:03.440
 This treasure will stay with us according Buddhism throughout the lifetimes.

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:12.840
 But treasure what we, what we accumulated with all so many hardships, so many emotions,

00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:23.240
 so many conceptions and challenges that only stays where we are here.

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:28.960
 And that also, if that happened is great, also there is so many things happen.

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:38.520
 What great Master Chantai Deva said, "The world is always challenges, always positive

00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:45.080
 in the hard shape of the true gathering of the external world, second, always challenge

00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:53.360
 of the true maintaining of what you gathered, third is always trying to increase that, and

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:55.960
 the fourth is to protect that.

00:29:55.960 --> 00:30:00.640
 Again, if there's some others are going to take away."

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:09.960
 So this is support different challenges beside of course the emotions and all the thoughts.

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:15.680
 And then every stays until we live on this earth.

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:19.920
 That's considered any good, but not many times.

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:27.480
 Look to that reed, so many people, so rich, so powerful, but yes something happened and

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:29.600
 it completely changed.

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:33.640
 That happened so many times, it's nothing unusual.

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:41.920
 But the treasure what we developed according with our own natural mind, with our mind,

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:56.270
 such as I said, calmness, peaceful, joy, appreciation, and contentment, relax, with that world

00:30:56.270 --> 00:30:57.360
 never

00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:59.280
 going to leave us.

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:03.840
 It will stay, but also it will explore more.

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:06.680
 When you have more joy, it will bring more joy.

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:12.060
 Not just that joy you got what you started, it's more.

00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:17.960
 And when you started with the loving kindness, the love that you started is not just stay,

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:35.280
 it multiplies, it increases and compensations, and appreciation, understanding, wisdom, thoughtful,

00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:44.960
 common sense, sensible, and practical, all those well calm and beautiful, really it all

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:47.600
 calm, so beautiful, perfectly.

00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:52.720
 So therefore, why we need to practice this?

00:31:52.720 --> 00:32:00.720
 Because we carry the pulse of externally and internally carry it with that, then it's not

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:09.680
 coming easily, therefore we need practice, even it's our own treasure, because we ignored,

00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:14.000
 we ignored why due to the ego clinging.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:20.600
 Ego can be thinking, I'm doing the best with ego, and then we can't completely carry by

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:21.600
 with that.

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:28.880
 Ego brought more ego, and self-important brought more self-important, and self-centered mind

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:34.840
 brought more self-centered mind, and more and more then become strong and strong, regiment,

00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:40.960
 regiment, and tense, and dark, and the eyes, and the cold, and then uncomfortable.

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:48.760
 No matter whatever you do to the ego, never say the ego is, we say, enough.

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:53.960
 That is really the true story, that you can ask.

00:32:53.960 --> 00:33:01.320
 So therefore, this really like this, so therefore, since we carry the pulse externally, therefore,

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:09.360
 even our own nature, the treasure, beautiful nature never left us, but we need practice.

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:20.880
 What is best, practice needs courage, commitment, loyalty, like this is your friend.

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:27.080
 You're not practicing and doing those joy and appreciation, trying to please someone,

00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:29.040
 trying to favor the others.

00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:35.800
 When we do practice joy and appreciation, and loving kindness, compassion, all simple

00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:45.800
 all Mahayana Buddhism, both each other, which is what helps you, fundamentally, help to

00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:49.200
 our self, your self.

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:56.760
 You become more stronger, more calmer, or we become more calmer, more peaceful, more

00:33:56.760 --> 00:34:01.320
 loving, more courage and commitment.

00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:09.280
 We become really strong, and we become the Bodhisattvas, gracious teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni,

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:15.280
 named the practitioner of the who carried the wisdom and the compassion combined together,

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:16.880
 one who practiced that.

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:21.960
 That individual is named Bodhisattvas.

00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:28.760
 One practices love and compassion, and the wisdom together, three together or two together.

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:35.400
 What that means, three together is loving kindness, compassion, and wisdom.

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:40.560
 And two together, compassion and love, wisdom.

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:48.480
 Two together, one who combined together, as a united together, practicing that, that practitioner

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:52.320
 is called Bodhisattvas in Sanskrit world.

00:34:52.320 --> 00:35:01.400
 In Sanskrit, it is called Sanchabchamba, and it is translated English, courageous one for

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:10.400
 the enlightenment, courageous one for the enlightenment, not timidness for the enlightenment,

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:11.000
 courageous

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.640
 for the enlightenment.

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:22.020
 To get enlightenment, to discover our treasure of our own nature of the mind, we need courage.

00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:23.020
 We need commitment.

00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:24.640
 We're not sensitive.

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:31.160
 We're not going to expect, or somebody says, "How nice, so nice, you're practicing, you're

00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:32.160
 practicing so good.

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:34.000
 I'm so happy you're doing good.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.200
 You've been so good for..."

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:45.560
 That if we're waiting for that world, our ego is still dominating.

00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:48.420
 Ego is manipulative.

00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:50.940
 We become so sensitive.

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:53.480
 And if we're dead, if we're dead, we're torn.

00:35:53.480 --> 00:36:02.280
 And then, we become what's called demon is controlling you.

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:07.840
 Not the demon is something outside with the big eye, and it's strange looking, all that.

00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:09.840
 No, not that demon.

00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:17.960
 But this ego demon is really controlling now, even your practice, but turn to your nice,

00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:20.360
 trying to be nice with that.

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:24.480
 And then you've not become the courageous, also, enlightenment.

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:34.720
 You become timidly sensitive, and kind of always waiting something, something.

00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:40.880
 Good things that please the ego, please yourself.

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:46.080
 So therefore, I mean, this is what's really true, and then quite a few Sangha members

00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:51.560
 mentioned that I should show something, because this is challenging time, challenging time,

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:52.560
 and should show.

00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:57.440
 So that's what I'm talking about, is really, I mean, that's what the really teaching said

00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:58.440
 then.

00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:03.120
 And then for that, also, I thought really, Paul with the great Master Luonginbazi teaching,

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:07.320
 and this is, many of you already have this book in English.

00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:10.840
 It was translated, "World's My Perfect Teacher."

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:16.680
 How many also is translated, some other terminology, kumze, lamma, shalom, Tibetan.

00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:23.880
 So you have that, but I'm going to read from there one verse, and then I just go over each

00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:26.560
 of those with the stories.

00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:31.800
 Also, I'm going to tell the stories of these different things, different things, so stories.

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:43.400
 So now, first of all, we are practitioners, and we are practitioners, and we are in samsara,

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:49.080
 we are where we are, we are not in the pure land, we are not in the sukha vadi, the amit

00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:54.040
 abhintamat, pure land, we are in samsara, really, samsara.

00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:58.840
 But this samsara, where we call the human realms, according to the great teacher, Buddha

00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:04.720
 Shakyamuni, this human realm is the best realm for the practitioners, if you like to really

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:08.920
 have gained realization, this is the best.

00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:09.920
 Why?

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:17.760
 Because three lower realms are not good, comfortable or suitable for the practice, because they

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:23.120
 have so many challenges, so many sufferings.

00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:29.680
 Maybe you heard the name three sufferings, the big, major sufferings in Buddhism, highlight

00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:40.040
 and pointing out that suffering, upper sufferings, and then there's called changeable sufferings,

00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:49.220
 then there's third is known as pervasive sufferings, or low laying sufferings.

00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:56.880
 So suffering, suffering, changeable suffering, low laying sufferings.

00:38:56.880 --> 00:39:04.800
 And I will tell you, the three lower realms are suffering of sufferings, they have so

00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:08.640
 many sufferings, one after another according to Shakyamuni.

00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:10.920
 And what are those three lower realms?

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:26.400
 The hill realms, I'm talking as R-E-A-L-M, I think, realms, hill realms, so many sufferings,

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:36.920
 and then hungry ghost realm, so many difficulties, little softer than the hill realm, but so

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:41.560
 many sufferings, constantly, not just once in a while.

00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:49.600
 And then, animal realm, there's so many troubles, also animal realm is a little lighter to compare

00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:55.320
 with the suffering of the hill realm and the hungry ghost realm, a little better, but there's

00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:56.600
 so many troubles.

00:39:56.600 --> 00:40:06.200
 So therefore, called three lower realms, L-O-W-E-R, I think, lower realms.

00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:08.840
 Why this called the lower realms?

00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:16.840
 Because the karma, those people who born on those realms, they met heavy karma with negative

00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:19.320
 emotions.

00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:24.040
 And that's why they're going through all, to cleansing, in one way they're experiencing,

00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:30.840
 but the other way, to cleansing their karmas, so called three lower realms.

00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:39.080
 And then, there's three upper realms, that means they did good karmas in the past, therefore,

00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:43.960
 their upper realms, they have less troubles or suffering.

00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:50.040
 And those three are, the first one is human realms.

00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:57.960
 Human realm, what suffering we have, changeable suffering, not all time sufferings, but then

00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:05.720
 occasionally comes, big sufferings, change, but basically we are being quite good, not

00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:10.800
 all time suffering as three lower realms.

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:16.520
 And then there is three, two upper realms, or another two, and those are known as, in

00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:23.720
 Buddhism, Asura realms and God's realms.

00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:30.760
 Because these two God realms, Asura and God's realms, they don't have the suffering of suffering,

00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:34.200
 also changeable sufferings, they don't have.

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:42.680
 But what suffering they have is low lay, undercurrent suffering, they didn't give up the suffering,

00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:47.240
 they didn't, they have suffering is ready to show up.

00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:50.160
 It's not on the surface.

00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:54.400
 So God's realms, those are called six realms.

00:41:54.400 --> 00:42:05.440
 Among that six realms, to do, to discover our inner treasures, three lower realms are so

00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:12.840
 challenged and kind of crushed by, by their own karmas, all sufferings, they really don't

00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:20.080
 have any time to, to touch to their own treasures, nature of the mind.

00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:29.800
 So then that three lower realms is not good, good suitable places for the practices.

00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:37.880
 Two upper realms, God's realms, Asura and God's realms, also not good, because they don't have,

00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:43.040
 they are so kind of like, beautiful, everything is so beautiful, since they don't have that

00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:50.640
 suffering, they can't suffer as active sufferings, so they are really so pleasant, beautiful,

00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:56.860
 nice and happy, they are completely distracted by the pleasures and happiness and enjoyment,

00:42:56.860 --> 00:43:00.360
 they don't have a time to do practices.

00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:08.960
 We human realms, and the gracious teacher, the best realm, that we have a good time,

00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:17.000
 and also we have challenge times, that is a perfect suitable practice in the Dharma.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:23.640
 When you have the more challenging difficulty, and you also know the peace and happiness,

00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:28.920
 then those who individually have more courage and commitment, confidence, then they really

00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:37.360
 can explore the ultimate joy in peace, happiness, for themselves, as well as benefit for others.

00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:47.120
 So all that this human realm is the best, but yet in human realm also of course has troubles.

00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:54.840
 Have a good practice, have a courage for the enlightenment, those old troubles are transformed

00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:57.560
 for the better purposes.

00:43:57.560 --> 00:44:03.160
 Most of the time those enlightened beings, we call the great masters, enlightened beings,

00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:10.320
 they all went through the different experience of what challenges of the world or the samsara,

00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:17.720
 this world, and then because of that, they really turned that situation to discover their

00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:21.360
 inner treasures, inner natures.

00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:26.480
 So that is about really that, and for that reason I'm going to talk this Lunking Bajji

00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:41.560
 teaching here, here is what he said, so the good practice and what it does, through the

00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:55.320
 dispute and harsh conditions, I met the Dharma and I discovered the path of the liberation,

00:44:55.320 --> 00:45:04.880
 so Lunking Bajji says, thank for that harsh and challenging situations, thank for, I'm

00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:13.600
 so grateful for that challenges, that difficulties, so I'm so happy with that.

00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:23.560
 And then next one he said that all the different sufferings went through, got all the different

00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:32.800
 sufferings and because of that, I met the Dharma and now I've achieved the ultimate

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:42.800
 unchangeable peaceful status, so thankful, thankful for that suffering, sufferings.

00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:58.640
 And then through the obstacles and the militias, militias by the non-human beings, beings,

00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:08.880
 I met the Dharma and now I've become the fearless status, so thankful for those non-reserve

00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:15.400
 beings, militias by the non-reserve beings.

00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:25.400
 And next one is that all the different human beings hated me and take advantage of me,

00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:34.640
 me and because of that, I met Dharma and now I'm completely got the perfect, happy and

00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:45.160
 permanent, peaceful, so thankful all those harsh conditions, difficulties from those

00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:48.160
 human beings.

00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:56.660
 And then next one, bad circumstances, all bad circumstances, so many bad circumstances,

00:46:56.660 --> 00:47:04.920
 I met the Dharma, because of that, I met the Dharma and now I've achieved the ultimate

00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:16.560
 unchangeable status, also thankful all those bad conditions, bad circumstances.

00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:23.560
 And then next one, through the encouragement of others, others, I met the Dharma and now

00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:32.040
 I discovered the heart essence of the meaning of the realization, so I'm so thankful to

00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:41.800
 those who encouraged me and now I dedicated all my merits to all those beings, beings,

00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:48.240
 beings, and now because of you all, I achieved this realization.

00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:54.000
 So this is, I'm just translating roughly, growth level, it is in the world, if you like

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:59.800
 to look, it's the world's perfect teaching in the toward the kind of toward the end of

00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:03.320
 refugee teachings, refugee teachings.

00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:07.320
 Now I go over each of those little bit stories.

00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:16.680
 The first one is so many kind of like prosecutions and harsh conditions, because of that, I met

00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:24.500
 the Dharma, Dharma and I achieved, I achieved the path of liberation.

00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:29.680
 And now, of course, generally you all know, you know this, it's not something different

00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:37.880
 than mysteries, but as I tell the story, it's truly happened stories that, this is again

00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:48.600
 in the Buddha's time, this first one, in the Kya Rasta, that is the very famous civilized

00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:54.120
 city that time in India, really very famous Kya Rasta.

00:48:54.120 --> 00:49:00.360
 And also, the gracious teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni, stayed in that area over 20 years, it's called

00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:08.240
 the Jeddah of Grob, and he stayed there over 23 years.

00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:20.080
 And in that place, and there is one family, and he's a man and a woman, a woman, and born

00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:28.560
 as like Brahma family, clients, Brahma family clients, but yet it's very poor, really not

00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:30.480
 rich, poor.

00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:36.960
 They had the seven daughters, not the son, no sons, seven daughters, and all the seven

00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:41.880
 daughters were able to marry, they married.

00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:49.240
 So now, the two couples, and his name was Brahma Chintelo, Chintelo, and the teaching

00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:57.120
 is the Chintelo, they both stay, that is, his wife, and they both stay.

00:49:57.120 --> 00:50:07.360
 Wife is always very harsh, harsh to her husband, her husband, and always kind of criticizing,

00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:10.560
 and all the time, really kind of arguing all the time.

00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:14.400
 So she feels so uncomfortable always.

00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:21.640
 Now the seven daughters with their husband is coming, visiting for their kind of something

00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:27.840
 like an anniversary, whatever, coming to the parents' house.

00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:35.920
 These seven daughters and also these seven husbands are not really nice to the father,

00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:42.040
 and he always kind of like criticized and tormented by himself.

00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:51.600
 Now around that time, he had to have to blow his field, but he don't have ox.

00:50:51.600 --> 00:51:04.820
 So he asked his friend and he borrowed the ox, so he borrowed the ox to blow in the palm.

00:51:04.820 --> 00:51:15.600
 He started blowing his palm, well, he's blowing the palm during that time, then, I'm sure

00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:21.280
 it's taking a few days, not just one, even they're poor, maybe they're taking a few days,

00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:22.680
 he lost the ox.

00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:34.160
 Now he looked everywhere, he couldn't find the ox that he borrowed from the friend, friend,

00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:41.800
 so he really feels so sad, said, now what I do, do, do, and I will tell to my wife,

00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:49.080
 she will argue me, and I tell this, they know these seven daughters and their husband knows,

00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:56.680
 they will argue with me, and now I lost the ox, and what to do, I don't have a place to

00:51:56.680 --> 00:52:01.120
 go back then, far distance.

00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:05.840
 He saw Buddha is meditating, meditating that.

00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:11.960
 He looked to him, and then this lady looks like he's meditating, and he's sitting under

00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:13.480
 the trees.

00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:22.200
 He comes closely, and he looks to the Buddha, Buddha looks so peaceful, calm, and this old

00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:29.800
 man that Brahma, Saint Dalo, looked to the Buddha, can't let it distance, not closely,

00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:35.880
 looking, wow, how beautiful he is himself, he looks like he doesn't have any worries,

00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:43.120
 he doesn't have any worries of losing the ox, he doesn't have the worries of the wife

00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:49.240
 is going to criticize and arguing, he doesn't have any worries of the three, seven daughters

00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:56.520
 and the seven husbands going to criticize, really he looks so peaceful, calm.

00:52:56.520 --> 00:53:02.640
 So he thought that he's looking to the Buddha, and the Buddha knew, immediately read his

00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:10.120
 mind, and when he came to close, Buddha said, exactly true, I don't have palm land, and

00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:17.360
 therefore I never borrowed, I don't have to borrow the ox, and I don't have wife, and

00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:24.600
 they're not going to caress, I don't have seven daughters and a husband, and I'm peaceful,

00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:33.600
 and I'm happy and peaceful, wow, he said, I really look like happy and peaceful, I wish

00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:36.120
 I have, I should have that.

00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:43.520
 He said, you want, polo, if you want me like, if you want to have peace like you, polo,

00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:52.000
 then do that, what, I, this Brahma, the old farmer said, I sure I can do that, of course

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:58.320
 you can do, he said, so then I really like to do, but I don't feel any comfort troubles

00:53:58.320 --> 00:54:05.080
 and happy, the joy in the home is like my, like cemeteries, and my wife is just really

00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:12.480
 constantly our way, and seven, they always caress me, so I'm ready if you will accept

00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:13.480
 me.

00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:20.520
 Buddha said, yes, then you should join, so he really joined, and Buddha gave the teaching,

00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:28.840
 he started practicing, he got the realizations, so that's the story of the old harsh difficulties

00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:36.040
 and prescriptions through that, then there's a Tamzi, Chintello, got the realizations,

00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:40.680
 so that's my post stories, stories.

00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:48.200
 And the second story is the old difficulties, challenges, troubles of the sufferings, and

00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:56.320
 got the realizations, realizations, unshakeable realizations forever, and I'm thankful for

00:54:56.320 --> 00:54:58.640
 the suffering.

00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:06.480
 This is really again true story in the Buddha's teaching, there is famous Arhata, female Arhata

00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:16.720
 known as Kautama Kimmung, Kautama Kimmung, she is a very famous nun, or the monk nun,

00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:24.960
 nun, very famous, she got achieved Arhata ho, but way that happened is not the simple,

00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:31.800
 she went so much suffering, really so many sufferings, this now you can read these things,

00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:41.440
 I think maybe so many, this 84,000 teachings, it's just really unbelievable how much she

00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:43.600
 got sufferings.

00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:55.920
 And then the story begins with these two merchants, wealthy merchant from Varanasi, wealthy

00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:57.040
 merchant

00:55:57.040 --> 00:56:11.200
 from I think these days in Pakistan, they met, well they are doing businesses, they really

00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:13.800
 become very good friends.

00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:20.880
 So when the merchant from Donjo comes to the Varanasi area, this merchant stays in this

00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:25.680
 Varanasi merchant, and they become very good friends.

00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:32.200
 And this merchant from the Varanasi area, and when they travel and go to the Donjo,

00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:40.440
 and he goes to the Donjo merchant's house and stays, so they become really best friends.

00:56:40.440 --> 00:56:47.560
 And they each other told how we should make, as we are best friends, I like to maintain

00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:53.560
 this friendship, relationship with us, even after we go home.

00:56:53.560 --> 00:57:02.640
 And one man that, I think Varanasi, the merchant said, said that in the end of that time, his

00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:10.200
 wife is pregnant, got pregnant, he got pregnant, he said, "Hi, I have the idea how we keep

00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:20.280
 the relationship, friendship, connection, family connection, and now my wife is pregnant,

00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:29.960
 is my wife this pregnant is when she gave the birth, if that is boy, boy, and then your

00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:38.640
 wife when you pregnant, if they got the girl, then we married that, or other way, whatever

00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:39.640
 that.

00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:46.120
 So we really arranged marriage, and other merchant, that idea is really good idea we

00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:47.620
 will do.

00:57:47.620 --> 00:57:50.840
 So then really they decided that we do that.

00:57:50.840 --> 00:58:01.840
 So Varanasi merchant gave the birth of son, son, moment this Donjo area, merchant, heard

00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:11.360
 his wife give the birth of the child, he bought lot of gifts.

00:58:11.360 --> 00:58:19.520
 This will be the future, my whatever this is, the boy's son's wife, or the husband,

00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:26.480
 and so I'm going to take the gift, so he really bought lot of gift today, in a way, to support

00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:31.360
 the newly born boys, the boy and give that.

00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:39.740
 And then his, Donjo's also wife now got the same way, pregnant and give the child, boy,

00:58:39.740 --> 00:58:47.600
 child, and the beautiful lady, beautiful young woman, but let it skinny, let it skinny, but

00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:50.800
 beautiful, really baby, beautiful.

00:58:50.800 --> 00:59:00.480
 And so named Kimmum, Kimmum is in Tibet skinny or slim, slim, so baby slim, again this Varanasi

00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:04.240
 one bought so much gift.

00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:11.920
 So now they grown up around in the tennis, according to the teaching, in the tennis,

00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:18.280
 they made big arrangement and they married, they married, and now they're growing beautifully

00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:27.640
 and this boy, now this baby, this Kimmum giving the birth of the babies, and traditionally

00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:37.040
 they go to the parent's house, give the birth, so when they give the birth, birth, and then

00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:42.440
 come back to the husband's house, and they stay there, they really kind of enjoy, have

00:59:42.440 --> 00:59:45.080
 a really good time, all that.

00:59:45.080 --> 00:59:53.240
 And then she again start giving another birth, and then they went, try to go to the parent's

00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:58.560
 house, mother's, like her parent's place, and she give the birth, and now there's really

00:59:58.560 --> 01:00:07.200
 coming nice, nice and everything, well they're coming back on the road, road is big suddenly

01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:16.360
 really kind of weather is not so good, neither is not good, they have to cross the river,

01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:22.680
 and they may try to make the river and so much rain and husband.

01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:30.760
 Now she have the one young baby, and the other is like maybe one year or two years or whatever,

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:37.840
 really old, and then her husband, poor but then coming back to the husband's home, house,

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:48.080
 on the road they made more, more than what's called, more weather, and more start raining.

01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:53.440
 So the husband, they thought they're going to make little bit hot to protect the rain,

01:00:53.440 --> 01:01:01.920
 and he went to collect some wood and leaves, and during that moment he was bite by the

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:10.880
 poison snacks, big poison snacks, and he died, he died right there, he died right there.

01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:19.120
 And then he's waiting, the husband, but never came back, come back, and calling him, now

01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:24.880
 he has new baby, so he can let the child and all that, he couldn't leave.

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:32.800
 And next morning, she searched, and not apart from, he was, he died, first he thought he's

01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:40.080
 laying down, and she hold, and she cried, and cried, so long, long.

01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:42.960
 Now he died, so there's nothing can do.

01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:50.880
 Now still he decided to go back to the husband's house, house, now the water is really big,

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:58.920
 water is very big, and now what happened, and so he can carry two babies, same time,

01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:06.400
 to cross the river, and he carry the first, he told, I'm going to carry first new born

01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:13.920
 baby, and then leave, oh no, first I thought I'm going to take my old one, which is one

01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:21.040
 or two years old, and then leave other side of the river, and come back and take this,

01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:33.600
 this one, and well he's carrying that baby, baby, baby, and cross the river, and the middle

01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:46.960
 of the river when he arrived, and folks came, folks came to other side, and folks are trying

01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:56.560
 to pick up her, her new born babies, and he trying to return back to that, and throw the

01:02:56.560 --> 01:03:04.240
 camera like she must be nervous, and she dropped the young baby, a young boy, a baby that maybe

01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:14.120
 one year old, dropped on the river, and she just completely become so sad, really sad,

01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:19.480
 sad what to do now, and then she trying to come back then, and the folks grabbed and

01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:30.320
 carried baby, so now she lost both babies, and her husband is in that riverbank, riverbank,

01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:36.440
 and still she came back to the family, and now she is really so sad, lost and old, and

01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:42.880
 now I'm not going to talk more things, as he said, you can read there, but she got one

01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:51.560
 after another, so much challenges, so much troubles, one after another, not just the

01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:58.680
 end of the day, continually had troubles, and then, and then she came through the camera

01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:05.760
 like through her karma, karma, she came close to Sharastha, and now she lost complete her

01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:16.960
 mind, troubles, and even she dropped her clothes, she is naked, she lost completely, and sad,

01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:24.720
 and also no food, no drink, and just really sad, and suffering, all that, and somehow

01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:29.440
 through her karma, and the blessings of Abhli, by the blessings of the Buddha, great teacher

01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:37.120
 Buddha, she came close to the jeddah of grubs, grubs, and far away jeddah grubs, she saw

01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:44.200
 the Buddha is sitting right in the middle of the big assembly, and giving the teaching,

01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:51.640
 at that moment she gained karma like conscious back, feel karma, she just really karma breathing,

01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:57.520
 able to breathe, but yet she's so shy, because she don't have clothes, karma like sitting

01:04:57.520 --> 01:05:03.100
 with like, like this treat, legs are like that, and looking to the Buddha without the

01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:11.080
 blanket, it's so calm, and the greatest teacher is all knowing, called in Buddhism, omniscient,

01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:18.760
 he sees everything clearly, but pick, particularly, but who is ready to need help, that moment

01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:29.040
 Buddha told Anand, take this cloth, Buddha give his robes, take this cloth, give to that

01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:36.680
 lady Kemu, Kemu, and ask to come here, and not give the teaching to him, and so Ananda

01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:43.960
 exactly listened to the Buddha, and went, give the teaching, give the cloth, and ask

01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:50.680
 to come, and she just thought wow, kind of feel, and really again that gained kind of

01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:59.960
 more energy, and more inspired, and she put the robes around her, and then came to Buddha,

01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:05.400
 and the Buddha gave the teachings, immediately, because Buddha know, Buddha is not just giving

01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:11.680
 the teaching with presumptions, Buddha know about their capabilities, and their readiness,

01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:17.560
 their mind, and they're exactly what needed to, and Buddha give exactly that teaching,

01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:25.520
 and that right in the sitting moment, she got the big realization, oh great teacher,

01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:33.200
 I got, I got, you give me the birth, you give me the life, you know, bought me from the

01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:42.640
 hell realm to heaven, so thankful, now I will follow as your disciples, please hold me,

01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:49.080
 Buddha said, yes, yes, and our daughter, exactly it is, I will be your teacher, you follow

01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:58.920
 my teachings, so then she practiced and meditated, soon she become arapaho, that's called Pama

01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:06.520
 Drakumba Kimon, so that is really the story of that this, when you have the courage and

01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:14.240
 the commitment, and the perseverance, even challenge difficulty, she got the realization,

01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:21.720
 arapaho, every, did that suffering, those things didn't happen, maybe he won't get realization,

01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:29.400
 so really this is what, what the teaching said this, so thankful for all those sufferings,

01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:40.240
 and then she become, started teaching, teaching to the old nuns, or the non-gatherings, assembling

01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:46.600
 nuns, and occasionally she told her stories that what she went through to counter, like

01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:52.800
 the practice of Dharma dead, and many of those nuns, particularly there's called 12 naughty

01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:58.560
 nuns, they started really like, kind of like, chasing him many times, kind of picking up

01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:04.680
 the head, had those challenges, the difficult things, what happened, and so this also happened,

01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:13.760
 happened that one, so that is the second story, and the third my story is, said here, by the

01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:20.160
 challenges of the non-wizard beings, or Hamid, the militias of non-wizard beings, and that

01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:26.640
 I'm telling, really tell the story of the Gelum Uparmam, but you all know, I think many

01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:32.480
 of you know, so I won't tell, but Gelum Uparmam was born, maybe around the 10th century, 11th

01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:39.080
 century, around that time, and according to the teaching, she was very very wealthy, family

01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:46.680
 born, or even a king, and then she is so beautiful, so so talented, and just, but yet she don't

01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:54.040
 like to really get married, and all that, and she joined with the, with the, with the

01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:59.880
 monasteries, and the nunneries, and she'd been practicing, but then, well, he's practicing,

01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:07.640
 she got the leprosy, leprosy, and the leprosy is a little bit, in Buddhism, kind of considering,

01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:15.320
 is a, received that relatively Nagas, Nagas, she, she lost all the limbs and all that, and

01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:20.640
 then she had kind of isolated herself, and because that time there's no cures, or I mean,

01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:27.400
 that is something really, very kind of like, big diseases, so that, but then she, she,

01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:32.440
 because of that, she received the teaching, particular practice, and she is teaching,

01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:41.040
 and she diligently practicing the meditation, and the awalok, and because of that, through

01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:49.600
 the blessings of awalok, she become as, then, that completely those, re-heal, the old, what,

01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:55.880
 those, her lost limbs, and all those things, by the leprosy, all come back, and regain

01:09:55.880 --> 01:10:01.520
 back those bones, and she saw the genocide, exactly, and fast, fast, and she received the

01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:06.400
 blessings from the genocide, and the moment, she performed for the genocide, there is a

01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:12.560
 very beautiful song, that she made, it's called, "Popto," in it, "Popto," or "Pressed

01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:20.240
 by the Pores," in each time, and, end, end of that, then, "Pressed in the Pore, in the

01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:29.120
 Pore, Om, Om Nijigdin, Om Olah, Psalm, Salom, Nijigdin, Amad, Palsam, Tho, Ba, Po," that's,

01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:35.000
 when you do that practice, really, it's a wonderful practice, powerful practice, healing practices,

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:41.000
 and meritori practices, the practice for the world peace, and peace, so that is, like,

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:49.400
 I mean, kiri is a practice, and then, all the, the, muscle dhamma, and through the heart,

01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:54.600
 and the challenges, and obstacles, through the, the human beings, I met the dharma, and

01:10:54.600 --> 01:11:02.440
 thankful for all that, that story, I told you, tell you a story of the Malarepa, Malarepa

01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:09.960
 is, because, become the sage, one of the biggest, the Buddhist achievement, realization of beings,

01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:15.200
 in the Buddhist history, or in the 20 Buddhist history, really big, because he had so much

01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:22.600
 troubles, is, again, through his aunt, and uncles, and everyone take advantage of the

01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:28.200
 support, Malarepa's young boy, and his mother, and the sisters, they take completely, even

01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:33.520
 though the bone as a wealthy family, or father, was a very quite businessman, and wealthy,

01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:38.560
 and everything, but then, I mean, you know, I won't tell, and because of that, in the

01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:45.160
 Malarepa, gain the realization, become the Malarepa, how wonderful, how beautiful that,

01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:47.880
 so that is about the Malarepa.

01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:54.720
 The next one is, through all different circumstances, bad condition, or bad circumstance, I met

01:11:54.720 --> 01:12:01.120
 the dharma, and that is, so thankful for all those bad circumstances, and that is, also

01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:05.760
 I told, I mean, there is many other things too, but I told you, tell stories of the,

01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:12.400
 of the Buddha Shakyamun himself, Buddha Shakyamun himself, as of course, is like, that's going

01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:18.880
 to become the Buddha in benefit for all beings, but in the according, on the surface, at a

01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:27.400
 relative level, Buddha was enjoying, and in the palace, with the Queen, all the luxuries,

01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:33.400
 every luxury things, that's how available, here, Buddha has the best, young princess,

01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:39.520
 it's called the Siddhartha, Prince Siddhartha, enjoying everything, really all, and the father

01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:45.560
 liked that very much, he liked to stay, because some prediction, or some omen readers, or

01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:51.240
 the palm readers, astrologers said, when they were born, he could leave the kingdom, the

01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:57.080
 palace, and then roam in the different places, and become the great teacher, he said, father

01:12:57.080 --> 01:13:04.440
 didn't like that, father liked to stay in the, in the palace, and become the ruler there,

01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:07.680
 so Buddha is completely surrounded by all that.

01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:14.400
 Around the age of 27, or around that time, didn't really know exactly, but around that

01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:21.560
 time, Buddha told his best friend, and the best assistant too, and he's like attendant,

01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:22.560
 called Dumba.

01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:32.400
 Dumba, I like to go out of the city, out of the palace, prepare the chariot, chariot,

01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:38.520
 and Dumba was his friend too, best friend too, and the attendant, and they also grew

01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:46.440
 almost the same, same age, same age, and Buddha, Dumba said, yes sir, yes sir, so he organized

01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:52.400
 the arrangement, and went out of the gate in the city, city.

01:13:52.400 --> 01:14:03.640
 When he went out of the city, on the road, Buddha saw, first time, the old man, old man,

01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:10.040
 and he can stand up straight, straight, he's completely bended, and walking with walking

01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:19.200
 sticks, and white hairs, and he even can't move easily, and also not looking, compilations

01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:25.240
 not looking, and that's the first time Buddha saw, Buddha said to Dumba, what is this?

01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:32.840
 He said, sir, this is called getting old, getting old, and this is now old man.

01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:39.960
 What this old man is just only for him, or for everyone, say everyone, one day you will

01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:46.640
 be like this too, he answered, and the Buddha thought this is not really kind of pleasing

01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:54.560
 outside, out seeing, and turned back the charades, he went back, and the Buddha felt, wow, this

01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:59.720
 world has this old troubles, even though I'm surrounded with all that, I mean, I won't

01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:06.220
 go about that thing, and the next day he asked Buddha, asked to do again the same, this time

01:15:06.220 --> 01:15:13.680
 when the southern gate went out, and the southern gate, when he went out, there is again, one

01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:21.600
 man is laying on the kind of floor, and many people are looking, and helping, supporting,

01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:27.840
 looks like, and the Buddha asked what it is, and this Dumba said, this is the known called

01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:35.160
 sicknesses, now this is getting sick, sicknesses, and he's sick, and he could survive, he could

01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:41.040
 be die, die, but this is sickness, and the Buddha again said, this is the only him or

01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:48.800
 others, everyone had the same thing, you were too, we all did that, and the Buddha turned

01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:57.840
 back, one, and then that next day when the Buddha was again, and the Buddha saw the dead

01:15:57.840 --> 01:16:05.160
 bodies, and kidding by the dead gory, by the relatives in India they do, and many loved

01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:12.520
 ones are going with that, and many are crying, and making so many different kind of miracles,

01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:19.240
 not sound, and he just said, again, Buddha saw that, so then he just said, Buddha, sorry,

01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:26.120
 I'm, that's it, I mean, same answer, same question, and next day, Buddha went to the

01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:37.120
 north gate, and north gate Buddha saw beautiful, the kind of very beautiful robes, yellow robes,

01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:44.120
 and looks like so happy, and so peaceful, and peaceful, and full of really kind of like,

01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:50.560
 no, no, like looks like warriors, Buddha asked what it is, this is called monks who left the

01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:58.560
 world, and now they're pursuing the peace and happiness, wow, that is, looks so beautiful,

01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:05.400
 beautiful, and then Buddha returned back, and then, then because of those old situations,

01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:17.040
 Buddha left the palace at 29, at 18, enlightenment at 35, so that is really story of the old

01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:23.400
 different conditions are happening this day, and next one is by the encouragement, I met

01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:29.680
 Dharma, and I'll thank for all those who met encouragement, that is, there's so many people,

01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:35.420
 so many are really encouraged by them, that in ancient time, or in the debate, those old,

01:17:35.420 --> 01:17:41.640
 most 25 disciples, and Gharib and Masambhava, encouraged by the King to some day, and the

01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:48.280
 different friends, to become the practice, and meditate, and study Sanskrit, and all that,

01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:55.440
 and they started meditating, such as, and get enlightenment, and become the Buddha.

01:17:55.440 --> 01:18:02.080
 So this is what the samsara has offered, and even though it is, so many things happening,

01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:08.560
 but we have the courage, and the commitment, and confidence, and stay with the course,

01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:14.080
 read that, and then really we got the realizations, understanding, so the troubles and difficulties

01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:19.680
 are not always bad, and there's so many stories, stories, really there's so many troubles,

01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:26.280
 the difficulty challenges come, and then you got something more than what you never expected,

01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:32.280
 you got the realization, understanding, the scholars, all that, so those are my stories

01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:38.480
 of the teaching, and now it's 11 30, and you have some questions, I'm happy to discuss

01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:46.200
 a little bit, and then otherwise we do little practice of the, of the, the kundasanku prayer,

01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:48.440
 right, we're doing that, you know, that, yeah.

01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:57.440
 >> You just mentioned that you can stay with the course, you mean the course of the action?

01:18:57.440 --> 01:19:02.880
 >> Of course, I mean the course of the practicing, practicing, again, as I said, at the beginning

01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:11.120
 time, I divided into two, that externally we focus more, that benefited to our, this lifetime,

01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:16.440
 we're more carried with that, but if we do something more deeper, deeper meaning, and

01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:21.840
 that will benefit, that means practicing dharma, practicing this, such as loving kindness,

01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:28.760
 compassion, joy, and application, and they really do kind of more virtues of activity

01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:34.200
 that benefit to you, to the others, that will bring more joy, and peace, happiness, more

01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:40.840
 reward in this life, but that what we developed is not going to leave behind, we really go

01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:48.360
 with that, and that's what the great master Nagarjuna said, that there's two, three individuals,

01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:56.440
 and one in, oh yeah, three individuals, and one individual is from the dark, going, following

01:19:56.440 --> 01:20:02.520
 from the dark to the dark, and the darkness, and then there is another individual is from

01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:09.120
 the light to light, to lightness, and there's some individual from the dark to light, from

01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:15.960
 light to the dark, one after, and we, it triggers our inner values, and our goodness of the

01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:23.720
 joy, and peace, happiness, and body, that that individual truly will follow from light

01:20:23.720 --> 01:20:32.280
 to light, to light, light, so I will say that is what I mean, okay.

01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:50.480
 Thank you, anything? Yes, thanks. Kimpo, I was wondering, is there a mantra that is the

01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:56.720
 cause for enlightenment, that we could, as we chanted it, we could think of the cause

01:20:56.720 --> 01:21:05.120
 of enlightenment. The old mantra is really good for enlightenment. Old mantra, particularly,

01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:12.600
 I think the simple one, is Ommani Bhemehong, really joined Ommani Bhemehong, who realized

01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:19.960
 all feelings, bodhijata, and joined also the mantra, even though it's not called the mantra,

01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:26.160
 joined the poor, immeasurable praise. May all living beings have the happiness and the cause

01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:31.140
 of happiness. May all they breathe from the suffering, the cause of suffering. May they

01:21:31.140 --> 01:21:39.480
 all have this abundance of joy, never separated from that abundance. May they all have the

01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:48.480
 great equanimity, realizations, really sincerely wishing those that say that, and joining that

01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:54.560
 maybe seven times, and then join the mantra of Ommani Bhemehong, excellent, and join the

01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:59.320
 world, Bhejanguru mantra, the world premise of a mantra. All the days Lilian has asked

01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:08.840
 me, all the something, to talk that there's a prediction, for a fascist of that. In the

01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:16.040
 iron drug, there could have some big troubles or changes in the world that's going to happen,

01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:24.160
 and that could happen. And so that to prevent those, those that troubles, also in that prediction

01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:30.440
 mentioning, do a lot of very short activities, join the mantra of the Gurbama Sambhoi, join

01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:36.560
 the mantra of the, of the Avalok Dehshora, and join practice of the Vedic life. And particularly

01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:43.080
 do the Gurbama Sambhoi, Sambhoi mantra, Omma Ahong, Vedang Gurbama, Siddha or that. Also

01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:49.600
 I will say, joined seven, this, of course seven line prayer, but joined is poor, invigorable,

01:22:49.600 --> 01:22:55.760
 really joined. We see that, that is the bodhicata, that is a computer, that is heart essence

01:22:55.760 --> 01:23:04.120
 for all the Buddhas. And also then, with that meditate a little bit, more relaxed meditate,

01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:11.600
 and then also this patience. When we have the practitioners, we should be also more patient,

01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:18.640
 but more, sometimes like practicing, become more sensitive than before they start practices.

01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:24.640
 That shouldn't happen. They become more, really patient, more kind of like, more strong, more

01:23:24.640 --> 01:23:31.360
 courage, more courage in the practices. And also they should become, then join the mantra

01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:39.680
 of the Jainese, Omma Anapimyo, or Vedang Gurbama Siddha. So prevent those, those iron drug

01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:51.920
 is like, professors also, that as much as you can. Okay, thank you. Anything? Yeah, please.

01:23:51.920 --> 01:24:07.040
 Hello. Oh, thanks. Thank you. Yes, I, I was wondering if we're chanting something like the,

01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:15.760
 say, four immeasurables, or maybe four thoughts that turn to mind, that kind of thing. Is there

01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:24.800
 any important difference between just continuing to repeat it, or saying one line, and then

01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:32.960
 pausing to contemplate that? If we prefer one or the other, does that matter really?

01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:44.800
 What the great master, Jung Moo, Kuntal Rambajam, of course, many of you all know,

01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:51.360
 Kuntal Rambajam is one of the really famous great masters, and then as well as others too.

01:24:51.360 --> 01:25:01.440
 He mentioned that how you enter to the Dharma, passage of the Dharma

01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:12.800
 or practice is devotion, devotion and fed. Through that, you will enter to the Dharma

01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:21.120
 and the practices. So that means, you not just have that and enter, and then that's it.

01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:31.200
 But keep the devotion, keep the fed all the time to the heart, the mind, you are in the Dharma,

01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:39.440
 you have that. And then what he said, and second, not just only him or Jung Moo Kuntal Rambajam,

01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:52.480
 but the other master too, the anchor or foundation stone of the Dharma is for this thought of the

01:25:52.480 --> 01:26:04.160
 renowned sessions. And what are those forethought as those you know, forethought are, join the

01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:15.920
 appreciation of the life. This life is precious. This life is special. This life is more precious

01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:22.400
 than the size of this, like diamond, like this size. Really, this so precious.

01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:30.880
 Precious, life is precious. So, joy and epic, but not just that, have courage and commitment.

01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:38.400
 I'm going to use this life for the better purposes that benefit to me, to all the others.

01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:47.120
 Really had that. That is the first anchor of the anchor or the cornerstone of the Dharma. Second is

01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:48.960
 the impermanent.

01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:58.560
 Impermanent, there's two impermanents. Gross impermanent and subtle impermanent.

01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:06.640
 Gross impermanent, we see ourselves. Oh, that something now happened. This happened. All the

01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:15.680
 building is a collapsed. Cup is broken. All this something, those are in Buddhism, the gross

01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:24.880
 impermanent. We detect because our knowledge is so gross. We don't really detect the subtle.

01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:33.600
 But because the subtle impermanent is so subtle, we don't detect. I'm sure the machine,

01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:42.800
 scientific machine will detect. Everything is changing instantly. In that philosophical system,

01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:53.340
 there is no really actually present existence in a way. Past is not existing that you can detect it

01:27:53.340 --> 01:27:53.680
.

01:27:53.680 --> 01:28:02.000
 The future is not can detect it. The moment you detect, that moment is changed. It is so past

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:11.360
 running. More fast than the lightening. Lightening. So that is our life is like that.

01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:19.280
 But well, with that situation, something we can hold, something we can enjoy.

01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:27.680
 So ruffle acting impermanent is the second anchor or second cornerstone of foundation stones.

01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:36.640
 That or that. And the third one, cause and effect are inevitable.

01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:46.000
 Whatever is a cause and condition, result that will come. Result comes like that.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:53.360
 So that means, what in a teaching said, Vedic teacher Buddha said and as well as

01:28:53.360 --> 01:29:02.720
 Nagarjuna said, this is not just only three of them. Since Buddha said all the masters, it is true.

01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:13.280
 If the root is poison, the result, the fruit will be poison. If the root is medicine, healing,

01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:21.200
 the fruit will be medicines. So that means, our thoughts, our minds are peaceful,

01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:28.960
 love, action will be peaceful and love. And our thought is, mind is negative in an anger and a

01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:36.800
 jello, action will be negative and action of jellows and negatives. So therefore, whatever we do,

01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:43.920
 that is not just to have only last that moment. According to the teaching, it made the footprint.

01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:51.680
 It made imprint. So that is called karma, inevitable. And that is so thoughtful with all

01:29:51.680 --> 01:30:00.800
 action is a cornerstone anchor of the practices throughout ourselves. And the next one is the

01:30:00.800 --> 01:30:07.680
 samsara has trouble. Samsara has challenges. Not everything comes exactly what we want.

01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:14.640
 Even you have everything, even you have the power, it won't come exactly as it is.

01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:23.440
 That's the way things are. So accept that. And remembering that is that is the anchor of the

01:30:23.440 --> 01:30:30.880
 practice. This anchor of the practice is not just the only short time. Keep that. Every practice

01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:38.320
 starts with that, is called. Then really your anchoring down, your stabilizing, your practices

01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:46.480
 and not then force the obstacles that cannot destroy that. Many times, the practitioners

01:30:46.480 --> 01:30:54.160
 are like all that. The obstacles, those are called the demons. Demons are, as I said earlier,

01:30:54.160 --> 01:31:01.440
 is not just something that strange beings come. Demon is what? Our negative emotions, our own

01:31:01.440 --> 01:31:10.800
 emotions is demons. That is what? Ignorance, attachment, anger, jealousness. Those are

01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:24.720
 reflected on the five, five, what's it called? No, no, no, no, no. This is called the five

01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:32.240
 obscurations by great master Nagarjana said. The first obstacles, first obstacle of the

01:31:32.240 --> 01:31:40.480
 practitioners or anyone actually really. When our mind is so much edited and become wild and always

01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:49.680
 crowing something, pleasing things all the time. Time. Mind is not restless. It's mind is

01:31:49.680 --> 01:31:50.240
 completely

01:31:50.240 --> 01:31:58.320
 saturated by the demons. Negative. And with that, and then because when you're having that thought,

01:31:58.320 --> 01:32:04.710
 then it comes what Nagarjana said in the teaching, then always feel kind of feel bad. Oh, I shouldn

01:32:04.710 --> 01:32:04.800
't

01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:11.520
 do that. I shouldn't. Oh, I'm sorry. I did that. Kind of feel the like little bit guilty or feel

01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:16.880
 the kind of like something that is not happening. Exactly. Because you have the expectation, like

01:32:16.880 --> 01:32:22.720
 to be everything, exactly where you like to be. And they're not, that is another obstacle.

01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:32.960
 And then kind of always violence is thought. I'm not saying always, but violence is thought.

01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:40.960
 And kind of like thought of that, like to convey all this person is not good. That person is not

01:32:40.960 --> 01:32:47.600
 good. Or they did this, that kind of recollecting of the old mistakes, the errors of the others,

01:32:47.600 --> 01:32:55.040
 not looking to our own self and looking. That is another obstacles of the practitioners.

01:32:57.360 --> 01:33:05.920
 And then dullness mind, sleepy, pokey, laziness, all that is obstacles of the practitioners.

01:33:05.920 --> 01:33:12.640
 And always criving, criving through the sensorial pleasure objects.

01:33:12.640 --> 01:33:19.600
 All the time to that. That is another obstacles of the practitioners.

01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:40.480
 And yeah, no, see. So those are the obstacles of the practitioners. Always watch for with that.

01:33:40.480 --> 01:33:51.600
 And then those are the four corners. And then you can recollect those as joined, those prayers,

01:33:51.600 --> 01:34:02.080
 really beautiful prayers that in the short Gondor has, such as what's called, and it's difficult

01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:09.760
 to get obtained in indoment lives. So difficult. It's true. Reflecting on those thoughts for a few

01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:16.160
 seconds, a few minutes, every you have time. Everything born is born to the, like is in

01:34:16.160 --> 01:34:21.840
 parliament and those are reflecting each of those things. Really wonderful thoughts. A few minutes,

01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:28.000
 every you have time. Then there's four in measurable. Again, each one, if you have time,

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:34.480
 join those and reflect in reaching that to every living beings. And those are known as practicing

01:34:34.480 --> 01:34:40.880
 of the, what's called the wishing bodhicata. You're putting wishing bodhicata in action.

01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:48.400
 Suppose we develop the bodhicata in our heart and mind. Now you exercise that. And then that

01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:57.760
 is born in measurable. Those are when becomes stronger than the exchanging and others are more

01:34:57.760 --> 01:35:05.280
 important than ourselves. And all those practice can do this. So those are very wonderful and

01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:19.040
 excellent. Okay. Anyone? Okay. Thank you. Then we do the little bit of what's called this.

01:35:19.040 --> 01:35:28.160
 So I say that, I said, I'm sure you already saw, but for this prevent of the all the

01:35:28.960 --> 01:35:35.760
 difficult things, particularly this protection iron dog. Yeah. Things that if you have time

01:35:35.760 --> 01:35:41.520
 and time, if you can do, do a little bit of lateral merit as much as military activity,

01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:47.120
 you can do that benefit for the other beings, such as really jointing, practicing of the

01:35:47.120 --> 01:35:53.360
 best upon the bodhicata. Joining these four in measurable practices,

01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:59.360
 target with that, then seven line praise of the Gurbam Masambhava, Risari and Mantara

01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:06.240
 of the Gurbam Masambhava. And in it, pretty day can you say that individually practicing Gurbam

01:36:06.240 --> 01:36:12.800
 Masambhava over all joined in the Vaidyan Guru Mantara or gruelly joined in the Vaidyan Guru

01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:19.680
 Mantara. So you can do those gruelly practice the Vaidyakala. Vaidyan Guru Mantara is really

01:36:19.680 --> 01:36:28.880
 wonderful and excellent. I think it's four or five years. Four or five years, I think. Iron dog

01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:50.680
 years. Now, this year is what? Dagon, no? Dagon, dalabdarsa, swa, dalabdarsa, swa like that. You

01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:50.880
 draw, draw, draw,

01:36:50.880 --> 01:37:00.030
 maybe six years, roughly, I think. Six years, iron. So that is, yeah, really as much as you can.

01:37:00.030 --> 01:37:00.080
 And

01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:09.600
 then I think we have really a lot of pictures of Gurbam Masambhava, no? In a box. So a lot of box.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:28.720
 Big one came. No, many boxes came. Oh, really?

01:37:28.720 --> 01:37:37.040
 Then we have no boxes. No, no boxes came.

01:37:40.240 --> 01:37:50.880
 Oh, wow. Wow, but really, many devotees in Taiwan, they really public so many

01:37:50.880 --> 01:37:59.120
 Gurbam, which is images, and they sent us to Gurbam Masambhava and a lot of boxes in Gurbam

01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:05.600
 Masambhava. It has mantara, it has images, and if you do that, you know, kind of keep that and

01:38:05.600 --> 01:38:12.080
 put those in a different kind of nice areas. And then in teaching said it will help to balance

01:38:12.080 --> 01:38:19.120
 the element and the balance at the end also help balance of the human mentalities too.

01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:36.240
 Okay, thank you. Then you have the Kunda Zanggu Pray. Okay, then we do the Kunda Zanggu Pray. Thank

01:38:36.240 --> 01:38:42.000
 you very much everyone for participating and joining. And now we do the Kunda Zanggu Pray.

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:49.040
 And this is a very powerful prayer, as you all know, and it is really join this and relax our

01:38:49.040 --> 01:39:03.280
 mind in that body, that status, and joining this as much. And

01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:16.880
 we joined in English, and we're going to join in this telephone.

01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:29.280
 Which is the page? Page 23 maybe, or 23, but telephone. First we joined the telephone and

01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:41.600
 then we go back to the page one. And today is a full moon. Full moon is a very special time

01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:47.920
 to do, visualize the Shira Zang and join this prayer thinking about which ending that and that

01:39:47.920 --> 01:40:04.320
 heard by the all the beings over six events. Thus it said from the 12th, it shows the

01:40:04.320 --> 01:40:12.080
 unimpeded realization of Buddha in a great profession. This is the ninth chapter,

01:40:12.080 --> 01:40:17.520
 the prayer that will lead sentient beings to be alive and sit without any choices.

01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:23.760
 Whoa! All appearance of phenomena and the possibility of meaning

01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:32.560
 have one source but truth right now. A miracle of knowing and unknowing.

01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:39.200
 This is the prayer of the Kuntazamma. May all beings have realized perfectly in life and

01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:45.280
 still. In the Pala, in the Ahmadada, the soul, so everything is uncompounded,

01:40:45.280 --> 01:40:52.320
 self-arising, infinite, inconceivable. By all the levels of samsara and the Rana,

01:40:52.320 --> 01:41:00.480
 knowing this sickness is Buddhahood. Unknowing is the wonder and the compassion. May all beings of

01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:07.840
 the three Rana, realize the nature of the inconceivable. So, for the more economical

01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:16.400
 proclaim, nature of the soul of the people, the soul is reliable by the sabbatim.

01:41:16.400 --> 01:41:27.200
 It is not named by the arrows that is diagonal, it is not obscured by the darkness of the mind.

01:41:28.240 --> 01:41:34.640
 Therefore, there is no sting to the mistaken production. Kudwad is a great expression in

01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:41.200
 your words, and the three worlds are free from the fear and the terror. Undehatred in the

01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:47.440
 five orders of the samsara pleasure, self-arising awareness is free from the desperate thought,

01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:54.240
 solid of home in the five orders. The radiating clarity of the awareness is unseasoned.

01:41:54.880 --> 01:42:02.030
 This single nature is five-fold wisdom. The action is five-fold wisdom with five primordial

01:42:02.030 --> 01:42:03.040
 goodness.

01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:10.320
 When this wisdom extends, Kudwudu uses the express of the power of the five worlds,

01:42:10.320 --> 01:42:19.360
 reports six yellow birds, and more ordinary awareness in their own. Amen, primordial Buddha.

01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:26.640
 By the power of the prayer, may all beings in the three realms of the samsara recognize

01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:34.690
 self-arising awareness in the expanding capacity of the great wisdom, may elimination are unseason

01:42:34.690 --> 01:42:34.960
ed

01:42:34.960 --> 01:42:38.800
 in consistent local elements of the emanating of the other's potential.

01:42:41.200 --> 01:43:02.800
 When the awareness of the source is forgotten, the mind becomes a known in the doubt in the

01:43:02.800 --> 01:43:10.480
 words in your mind to cause it. Instantly, one thought, one breath, and then the other one.

01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:19.440
 This begins to find other, find their enemy, and so, clinging is between the abbot's door.

01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:25.440
 The sharding from the clumps of thoughts and the increasing comfort of the part of it.

01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:32.160
 There is no end to the activity of the five worlds, so the shoulders are good to be the

01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:40.160
 opposite. This is not the one, the other. I am the brother by the power of the prayer.

01:43:40.160 --> 01:43:47.840
 In all beings, Kudwudu, may we all think of our inner self-awareness.

01:43:47.840 --> 01:44:03.520
 In all beings, Kudwudu, may we all think of our inner self-awareness, may we all think of our inner

01:44:03.520 --> 01:44:03.520
 self-awareness.

01:44:03.520 --> 01:44:09.520
 In all beings, Kudwudu, may we all think of our inner self-awareness.

01:44:09.520 --> 01:44:13.920
 May we all think of our inner self-awareness.

01:44:13.920 --> 01:44:21.520
 In all beings, Kudwudu, may we all think of our inner self-awareness.

01:44:21.520 --> 01:44:27.520

01:44:27.520 --> 01:44:35.520

01:44:43.120 --> 01:44:45.120
 In all beings, Kudwudu, may we all think of our inner self-awareness.

01:44:45.120 --> 01:44:47.120
 May we all think of our inner self-awareness.

01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:49.120
 In all beings, Kudwudu, may we all think of our inner self-awareness.

01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:51.120
 In all beings, Kudwudu, may we all think of our inner self-awareness.

01:44:51.120 --> 01:44:53.120
 In all beings, Kudwudu, may we all think of our inner self-awareness.

01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:55.120
 In all beings, Kudwudu, may we all think of our inner self-awareness.

01:44:55.120 --> 01:44:57.120
 In all beings, Kudwudu, may we all think of our inner self-awareness.

01:44:57.120 --> 01:44:59.120
 In all beings, Kudwudu, may we all think of our inner self-awareness.

01:44:59.120 --> 01:45:01.120
 In all beings, Kudwudu, may we all think of our inner self-awareness.

01:45:09.520 --> 01:45:11.520
 In all beings, Kudwudu, may we all think of our inner self-awareness.

01:45:11.520 --> 01:45:13.520
 In all beings, Kudwudu, may we all think of our inner self-awareness.

01:45:13.520 --> 01:45:15.520
 In all beings, Kudwudu, may we all think of our inner self-awareness.

01:45:15.520 --> 01:45:17.520
 In all beings, Kudwudu, may we all think of our inner self-awareness.

01:45:17.520 --> 01:45:19.520
 In all beings, Kudwudu, may we all think of our inner self-awareness.

01:45:19.520 --> 01:45:21.520
 In all beings, Kudwudu, may we all think of our inner self-awareness.

01:45:21.520 --> 01:45:23.520
 In all beings, Kudwudu, may we all think of our inner self-awareness.

01:45:23.520 --> 01:45:25.520
 In all beings, Kudwudu, may we all think of our inner self-awareness.

01:45:25.520 --> 01:45:27.520
 In all beings, Kudwudu, may we all think of our inner self-awareness.

01:45:27.520 --> 01:45:49.520
