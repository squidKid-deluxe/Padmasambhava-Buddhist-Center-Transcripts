 [NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 [NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.160
 Good morning and welcome, everyone.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.200
 This is one of the very glorious and beautiful day

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.240
 of the Buddhist history.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.800
 Certainly, it's for us one of the great moment in our life.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.960
 We are celebrating the very special significance

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.520
 of the event that marks one of the beautiful history

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.600
 in the Buddhist history in this holy land of the Saranath,

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.640
 or the way the Buddha forced to give the will of Dharma,

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.400
 or the turning of the will of Dharma.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:26.880
 [NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.960
 This nunnery is very important.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.040
 We really thought that because in the holy land,

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.200
 such is the holy land, there is no nunneries in history

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.840
 that we can read happened.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.800
 The first nunnery in Saranath in the history after 2,550th

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.300
 [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.280
 First nunnery.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.360
 You are very lucky.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.240
 You are very nice.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.040
 We are very happy.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.880
 No, first nunnery.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.920
 There hasn't been a nunnery here since the time of the Buddha.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.640
 At least documented that there was a community of female

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.000
 practitioners here.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.600
 So Rumpushets have dedicated this to the continued learning

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.080
 of teachings for the female communities

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.320
 that they receive and hold the teachings

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.880
 and bring them to maturity, both in the practice, meditation,

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.440
 and study, the three aspects, three pillars of Buddhism.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.960
 In the according to the Buddha's teaching,

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.200
 the nunnery started in the Sharvasta,

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.080
 but nothing really mentioned in this holy land.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.160
 There's a lot of monasteries mentioned, but nothing nunnery.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.560
 So we thought that we can start some nunnery.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.740
 It will be really wonderful.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:09.160
 And Sunday is the day of our opening nunnery.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.040
 It will be very--

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.040
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:20.280
 Many of the peoples are coming to our openings.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.920
 Women's lineage in Tibetan Buddhism

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.320
 is really, really important.

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.520
 Most of them, I know, most realized

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.480
 teachers will be doing practices with female deities.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.120
 Just it's very integrated and very important.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.840
 And that was the basis for wanting to, or aspiring to,

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.080
 because we didn't know that it would be possible.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.320
 But we aspire to bring women into the arena

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.080
 and to carry the lineage forward.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.000
 [NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.320
 Now we have a board at nuns.

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.160
 My name is Sandy.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.200
 I am from Nepal.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.560
 I am 11 years old.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.600
 I'm Bema Weasel.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.520
 I'm from Nepal.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.680
 I'm 16 years old.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.680
 I am Tasi Yankton.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.240
 I'm 16 years old.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.720
 I am from Sikkim.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:14.480
 I'm Chiki.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:15.440
 I'm 20 years old.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.040
 I'm from Bhutan.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.040
 My name is Dhoma Chiki.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.520
 I'm from Nepal.

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.040
 I'm a Hindu.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.640
 I am 20 years old.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.520
 I'm from Nepal.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.760
 And they all, generally, they're all interested.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.800
 They become-- they need nuns.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.040
 My mission is to become a nun.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:41.200
 By being a nun, I want to retreat a lot.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.200
 And I want to study more about the philosophy

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.320
 and as well as the Tibetan grammars,

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.240
 because in Bhutan, there is no Tibetan grammars

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.960
 and much philosophies.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:59.040
 And if we do a dharma or more dharma in this life,

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.960
 in this life, we'll be peace, peace.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:10.080
 And it is easy to be a happy life.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.680
 I like a nun's life.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.440
 I request to my mum.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:21.200
 I want to be a nun because of the dharma.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.640
 The Bhutan is about your own path, your inner self.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.680
 And they're reaching down to the depths of understanding

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.880
 in early life about the world.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.800
 And they've chosen to be students of the Bhutan,

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.480
 the Buddhist teachings, Buddhist doctrines, which are so inspiring

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:46.960
 and so just take it to a new place and make you whole.

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:56.000
 [NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.360
 Being a nun, I want to help all the given beings

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.920
 as well as to teach whatever I move to the other people.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:12.440
 [NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.120
 There are so many great teachers in India,

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.080
 those Buddhist great women teachers,

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:23.280
 both in the Vinaya systems and as well as the Mahayana

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.440
 and the Vaidhyana and particularly Vaidhyana.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.000
 There are so many women great teachers.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:37.960
 [NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:43.240
 If I can do, I want to become the Ani Kimbo.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.720
 [LAUGHTER]

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.640
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:49.680
 You are really excited.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:50.840
 I'm very happy.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.000
 We are going to celebrate.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.680
 And the day after-- oh, no.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.800
 I think 12, Sunday, coming soon.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:00.320
 So everyone is so much excited and happy

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.160
 and also energetic, monks and nuns.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.120
 Everyone is really working hard now,

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.080
 trying to prepare all these things.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:10.280
 This is one of the beautiful nuns here.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.680
 This is another one.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:12.680
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.920
 Put all the prayer flags up so that it's very festive,

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:20.200
 but also has the emblem of the horse with the energy horse.

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.360
 We call raising up the wind horse.

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.560
 And it has all the prayers for revitalizing and bringing

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:26.800
 all the energies together.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.560
 That's representing all the colored energies.

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:31.320
 This is very powerful.

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:34.960
 I like a one nun.

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.800
 Her name is Lauren.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:42.760
 I like very much because she's very kind-hearted to us.

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:45.360
 Also, she is helping our [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.960
 to build a new nanari.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.840
 They worked all night last night to finish

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.000
 and to do some of the finishing touching.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.360
 We've got some palm trees coming this afternoon.

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:59.320
 And we're going to sort of be in the backdrop of all these work

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:02.680
 as we'll have completed it so it looks a little more comfortable.

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.040
 Things go, they're on pace here.

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.920
 There are no great machinery.

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.600
 Bricks and everything is done by hand.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.920
 I think there has been only one machine here,

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.120
 and it's a polishing machine.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.280
 Otherwise, everything has been done by hand.

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:15.160
 It's just an extraordinary feat to do this.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.440
 I think the building started a year ago.

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:22.280
 So we could say that it's 95% finished.

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.160
 Wow, they're really doing so well.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.280
 It's a group to get the paintings so well.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.640
 This is the symbol of the Buddha teaching.

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:31.800
 The Buddha teaching is called the Dharma Wheel.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:35.760
 Dharma Wheel symbolizes all the Buddha's teachings,

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:41.120
 like the wheel, meditation, and achievement.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:44.120
 And then to do symbolize the teaching of the Buddha

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.920
 is nonviolence and peace.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.440
 This teaching is equal for all the living beings

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.280
 to bring them peace and happiness.

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.000
 They're equal.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.920
 There's no difference between any living beings.

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.120
 We all have the same Buddha nature.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:59.360
 We all like the peace and harmony and nonviolence.

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.840
 So therefore, even the deers and animals

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:05.880
 also come to listen to such a peaceful teaching.

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:08.000
 And so that's what they symbolize.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.960
 But they're using that reference of books on how to bend.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:15.200
 But they're doing really well.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:19.560
 And we like to be really completed as much as we can,

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:20.760
 before the 12th of November.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.320
 So it looks more clean and beautiful

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:26.040
 so that we can really feel happy and joy

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.600
 and dedicate the merit.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:31.600
 Merit for the world peace, for all the individualists,

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.440
 to everyone for the good cause.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:43.360
 Tomorrow is then a really full day

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:46.160
 with the spiritual Dharma activities.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:49.600
 And we're really also going to dedicate these merits

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.760
 for all the living beings, to all the support

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:54.040
 and donors.

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.760
 And then we wish really to everyone, those who are here

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.280
 and those who are gone from our side.

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:02.040
 And every best and every good things

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:06.320
 happened and then reaching enlightenment in the Buddhahood.

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:09.120
 That's what really we are praying and we are hoping.

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:11.960
 And that's what we're trying to symbolize

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:14.360
 by every other event and activities.

 in Sarnath since the time we opened up.

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:45.200
 There is no accounts of any nunneries at all.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:45.280
 Good morning and welcome everyone.

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:49.320
 This is one of the very glorious and beautiful day

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:51.360
 of the Buddhist history.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:55.800
 Certainly is for us one of the great moment in our life.

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:59.600
 And do meditation practice, do meditation activities.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:04.240
 If you do that, you will get equal benefit

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:08.520
 as Buddha himself, living, benefit.

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:11.960
 Because of those old reasons, many great devotees

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:16.000
 of the old from the high to the beginner practitioners

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 visited those holy spotters and many of those praises

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.840
 and remembered and meditated and practiced

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:25.920
 and bring more love and kindness and comparative thought

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:28.440
 in their mind and heart and spread it

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:32.000
 and share that nature to the other beings and others.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.560
 And that's how the Buddhism become the symbol of love

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:38.560
 and peace of this universe and world.

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:43.000
 Again, from the day one, the Buddhist nun, Ani Lorraine,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.080
 the [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:47.600
 who put so much effort to bring--

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:51.160
 actualizing to bring this land.

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:55.520
 And until now, so we'd like to thank to all the donors

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:58.160

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:02.720

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:04.400

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.880

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:10.640
 [APPLAUSE]

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:18.080
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:24.360
 I'm so happy and peaceful.

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:29.560
 I like a nun's life because of the Dharma.

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:37.000
 So I also meet very kind and very kind-hearted [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.600
 and Ani Lorraine.

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:41.400
 They are helping so much.

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:45.920
 And also, they are--

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:50.680
 also, they are very kind for us.

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:54.120
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:54.120 --> 00:15:02.160
 Also, I understand, like, many of you

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.920
 are going to sponsor the candles.

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:08.280
 Like, they're marking the years of the Buddha's sake.

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:12.480
 Like, in our birthday, 2,550 years.

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:14.920
 But this time, we're not going to blow up.

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:16.840
 We're going to continue to live.

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:18.160
 And then, actually, let it go.

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:19.560
 [LAUGHS]

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:23.480
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:29.240
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:37.360
 We like our nunneries should be very big and very famous.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:39.640
 All that we are providing--

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:42.280
 and that, actually, is not just we are providing.

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:45.520
 It's all like members of the Vyamassamabuddhi Center

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:47.720
 and proper really donated that.

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:56.360
 [NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:15:56.360 --> 00:16:01.640
 We want a very big, big sharing room.

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:11.480
 Also, library-- also, we want many nuns.

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:16.200
 Many nuns, and we have a class of philosophy English

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:19.280
 or something.

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:22.840
 Also, we want internet or internet.

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:27.080
 In Tibet, we have seen that the eye medicine is always

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:28.160
 used for the eye.

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:29.400
 Eye sounds.

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:31.240
 That's why, really, we are doing that.

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.040
 So any support and any contributions

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:36.880
 that can help for this purpose, we really

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:40.960
 will use that for the right directions

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:45.480
 and will propel their contribution in the right way.

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:53.960
 [NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:16:53.960 --> 00:17:00.800
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:05.040
 As the Buddha gave the first teaching here,

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:07.600
 and that teaching spread throughout the world

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:09.960
 and throughout the generations.

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:14.680
 And hopefully, as we start this small nunneries,

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:18.960
 continue to spread the value and the call and the teaching

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:23.400
 and the messages of the Buddha by those great female masterals

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.520
 continually and throughout the world

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:27.280
 and throughout the generations.

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:29.640
 So that is really our wish and prayer.

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:31.760
 And as we said, too, first time in the Buddha

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:36.240
 gave the first teaching, only five human students, only five.

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:39.120
 And we have eight nuns now that couldn't exist.

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:41.200
 And maybe more is coming.

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:44.000
 So hopefully, it will really continue

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.520
 igniting, like grass fire.

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:50.720
 And then big continue running as a Mississippi River

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:54.080
 or River Ganges, ongoing, unseasoned,

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:58.720
 spreading the really message of the teaching of the Buddha.

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:01.960
 Well, everybody's so happy and they're inspired now

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:07.120
 that some new nuns are coming, the family is growing.
