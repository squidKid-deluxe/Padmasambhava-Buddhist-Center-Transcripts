00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.640
 Okay, thank you everyone again, thank you delis, everyone. Welcome again, as I said already.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:16.480
 Welcome. Again, we are gathering here for one really purpose, to discussing a little bit of kind

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:26.640
 of reminding to each other our practices, our heart-filled practices, and which is nothing but

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:35.520
 loving-kindness, compassion, joy and appreciation, and to stay peaceful, peace and harmony. My soul

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.600
,

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:42.800
 yours, everyone, we think that how to activate those beautiful qualities. We stay meaningful,

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:50.000
 something rewarding in this life. Life is not long, supposed to be according to the teaching

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.120
 of what everyone says. Not long, but well we are here, and as long as we are on this earth,

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:07.600
 our responsibility to be happy, peaceful, make happy and peaceful others as much as we can.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:16.800
 Stay with that, and we spend a life with that. I think then we are quite good, really we are making

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:24.640
 meaning of lives, not wasted time, and spoil the time of ours and others, all those who are

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.120
 connected

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:36.080
 to us. That's quite good. So for that reason, we are discussing, engaging, and exploring of the

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:43.440
 teaching of our gracious teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni. This connective teaching is not just a kind of

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:51.440
 accidental. According to Buddhism, it has so many beautiful reasons, causes on the behind the scene

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:59.840
 that maybe we didn't really spot it very much, but it has so many beautiful causes and conditions,

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:08.480
 and both situations. Not just only that, we have beautiful lives. We are all recently human beings,

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:17.600
 quite okay human beings. This is also not just casual. According to Buddhism, life is precious,

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:25.360
 particularly practitioners. Life of the practitioners is very, very precious. What is called

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:38.880
 18 endowments? At freedoms, 10 luxuries. We have those who are here with us. These 18 endowments,

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:47.760
 generally it is always with us as long as we live that, but the 10 luxuries,

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:55.840
 many times it's fluctuating. You read, you reflect those, each of the luxuries.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:03.760
 Read and check up to ourselves, one's own self. My question, I'm going to check up,

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:11.520
 check up how many of those luxuries I have now. Maybe we start all the 10 luxuries,

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:20.720
 and then the time is moving. Well, along the time, maybe we really skipped quite a few of those

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:21.360
 things,

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:32.160
 fluctuated. If that is so, this is our responsibility to activate that, to bring that in the full

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:40.480
 10, 10 luxuries. And with this thought, with those understandings, again, we're going to reflect

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:40.640
 the

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.680
 teaching of the greatest teacher of the Buddha Chakra Muni, and Gaurabha Sambhava. And for that

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:55.360
 reason, again, we bring what? Joy and appreciation, and both each other, and the purity understands

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.920
.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:04.800
 Those are again, vital of our practice. Changing our motivation is foundational,

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:12.640
 and keep that motivation where we practice it, it is central columns. And we keep continuing that,

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:19.600
 it will bring the fruit, result of that, what we motivated, what we're thinking of that,

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:27.200
 it really will bring that. So therefore, all those virtual motivations, intentions should activate

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.600
 it,

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.800
 and then we reflect the teaching. Today, we're reflecting, going through the teaching of the,

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:39.440
 again, his teachings of his own Dhonya Rambhaji, heart advice to the fortunate ones.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:46.530
 That is what we're going again. This time, today, I'm going to conclude of these teachings, what we

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.960
're

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:54.160
 going through this teaching. Slowly by slowly, exploring the meaning of each of those lines of

00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:01.280
 the world, and we went deep, many of those, really we went deep, even I never thought we will do

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.000
 that.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.480
 But then it happened, we did, really deep. In a way, I feel happy with that. We went thoroughly,

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:14.560
 very steadily, and went one after another, touching to the core of our greatest teaching,

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.520
 brother Shakyamuni's teaching, or the teaching of lineage, and connecting that to our heart.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:26.150
 We heard all these things, what I said, these past years, and on this teaching, I'm sure you all

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.480
 heard

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:36.160
 that. But it's maybe, it's in the wake memories, not books, not books, or some kind of other place,

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:44.000
 but we went through this, that one after another, we reflect our memories, some really, not maybe

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:51.680
 all of you, but few of you, that we reflect our memories and understand our dharmas. And so that's

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:57.440
 what, I'm very happy with that. And today, we're going to go to the last part of these teachings.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:04.080
 Last part of this teaching is, is then, as we discussed the other day, is generally, is the

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:10.080
 ending of this teaching of the Hizam Dhanjirumurji, is the inner tantra teachings, inner tantra.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:17.520
 Inner tantra is Mahayoga teaching, Ano-yoga teaching, and Ati-yoga teachings. So it is the

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:25.520
 inner tantras. All the very inner teachings are summarized into two, what's called two groups.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:31.920
 Those are known as visualization of the creation stage of practices, and completion stage of the

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:40.720
 deserving practices. Those are two practices. And so here, what we went through, and which is

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:52.080
 clearly, His Holiness Dhanjirumurji mentioned here, mentioned in this page two, in the middle

00:06:52.080 --> 00:07:01.120
 of the page two, said, "Lama and the Yadams are inseparable from one's own mind." So that means,

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:14.160
 "Lama, Yadam, on Dakini, all is within our nature of the mind." That is the foundation. That is

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:24.080
 what our mind represented embodies all of those Dakinis. Now, when you activate those

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:35.120
 deities, or the gurus, or the Dakinis, then what is known as the development stages,

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:42.160
 or the visualization, if I use a simple word, visualization stage is inseparable from one's

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:49.840
 sorry, visualization stage meditating is all apparent to be empty as moon in the reflection

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:57.600
 on the, in the waters. Visualization, as of course we all know, visualization is a complete stage,

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:05.040
 what we call the developing creation stages, if I use the word creation stages, or visualization

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:13.920
 stages. Most of the time we visualize, our self, we kind of focus on one's own self, isn't it

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:19.680
 different from the Buddhas, or different enlightened stages, we visualize that. But here,

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:30.160
 what is it? All the appearance, every appearance is enlightened status, every appearance.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:39.840
 So that means, all the poems are enlightened status. Bring up that realization,

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:47.600
 maintain that is the visualizations. How that visualization is, as in the teaching said here,

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:57.680
 reflection moon in the waters. It is just lucid status. That, how that is, we discussed the other

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:03.920
 day, and many of you already know, what great teacher of Buddha said, "Poem is emptiness,

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:12.160
 emptiness is the poem." So that means, the visualization is emptiness, emptiness is the

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:21.360
 visualizations. That is what it is, the everything. So that means, whole universe, the world

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:33.680
 is as a reflection moon in the waters. Whole universe is empty. That empty is an appearance

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:41.360
 status. That is the purity status. What in the teaching, in the Gaurabhata says, "On the relative

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:49.600
 truth, everything is pure." Relative truth, everything is a purity status. So that means,

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:56.720
 five aggregators are the five dying of the Buddha, five elements are the five female Buddhas,

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:05.280
 every combination, those other element is our divine medallas. There's nothing else besides

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:15.200
 enlightenment. So that all enlightenment, that is in purity, pure status, everything is enlightened

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:24.840
 status. And now, that, how that is on the absolute level. Then they say, reflection in the moon in

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:24.880
 the

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:37.120
 water is all empty. What do you see? What do you think? What do you hear? Or what we hear? What we

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:46.560
 see? What do we think? It's never separated from the emptiness. It's all within that status. Of

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:53.840
 course, you know, you know this. All, we heard this so many times, in some degree also we went

00:10:53.840 --> 00:11:02.000
 analytically, this is all, that is what it is. And he's going to discuss later too, here. So we

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:13.840
 told that. And then, same thing here, he said, next one is, second is, all the sound, sound,

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:24.160
 verbal, verbal communications, sound, verbal communication, everything is sound emptiness.

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:36.480
 That sound emptiness is known as mantras, divine voice. Mantra, which means protecting the deluded

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:44.960
 mind. World syllable that protects the deluded minds, or protecting that. So everything is a

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:51.360
 mantra. When you have the realization of everything is purely the status. There is no

00:11:51.360 --> 00:12:00.000
 selected mantras. All is mantras. All is divine sounds. Everything is enlightened status.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 Whole universe is enlightened status. So what is a selected guru of the mantras,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:17.840
 this and that things. This is, we is vastness, the we, we, e, i, w, that our we is vast.

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:28.560
 It's not limited, not restricted. The pervasives, every form is enlightened. Every sound is

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:37.040
 something enlightened. How that happened? Then here he only says, the next one said, all of this.

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:46.800
 Third one, all this, all this is the display of the one's own single awareness,

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:55.680
 dharmata, the true natures. Why all that is enlightened status? Because everything is a

00:12:55.680 --> 00:13:04.480
 display of the dharmatas. Dharmata means true nature or the great emptiness. Dharmata is also

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:13.280
 means the, what's called the dharmadhatu, true natures, absolute status, great emptiness,

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:22.320
 mother of all the Buddhas. That is what really referring of this dharmatas. And where is that

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:28.080
 dharmata we to discover that? According to Zokki teaching here, I mean started Zokki teachings,

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:38.160
 started is all from the, our own mind, our rukma, our mind, mind, nature of the mind.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:47.760
 Nature of the mind and the deluded mind is different. This time talking nature of our,

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:55.440
 or each of our mind, is embodiment of tirikayas, is in the tirikaya status.

00:13:55.440 --> 00:14:00.880
 And that is of course, many of you received the teaching you all know.

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:08.400
 Emptiness aspect of the nature of the mind or emptiness aspect of the rukma,

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:18.880
 if I use it to be the word rukma, is dharmakaya, the absolute forms. And clarity aspect of the

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:28.000
 nature of the mind or the rukma is the sambokaya, the form of the richness.

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:38.160
 Sambokaya is the luxurious body, luxurious form or luxurious, all the luxurious clarities. And

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:46.160
 the display aspect of the movement or the display aspect of the nature of the mind is

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:52.960
 the nirmakaya that we heard. This is the ordinary tirikaya.

00:14:54.640 --> 00:15:05.600
 Our nature of the mind is ordinal trikayas status. When it is reflected that the ordinal trikaya

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:17.280
 externally, then this is called the reflection of the trikayas, reflections of the trikayas.

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:26.800
 That our dharmakaya of the nature of the mind when it is reflected, it is known as space.

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:36.080
 S-P-A-C-E, space, is a reflection of our dharmakaya mind,

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:49.600
 externally, space. This movement or sorry clarity aspect of the nature of the mind when it is

00:15:49.600 --> 00:16:02.320
 reflected, that is known as the sound, sound emptiness, sound. When the nirmakaya aspect of

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:08.160
 our nature of the mind is reflected externally, all those are known as poems.

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:16.640
 So what else then, as I mentioned a few times and you all know, there is nothing else in this world

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:32.400
 besides poem, song, space, all space, song, and poems. That is reflection of the our own

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:39.360
 nature of the mind or the rukba according to zoki point of views. In that level,

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:44.960
 as His Holiness, we said here, the revitalization aspect of the reflection moon in the water

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:55.280
 and sound system of the emptiness of the mantra is all display of our own awareness. True nature,

00:16:55.280 --> 00:17:03.840
 nature of the mind. Visualization is a display of our own mind and sound system of the mantra

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:09.520
 is a display of our own natural mind. Therefore, there is nothing else

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:19.600
 beside display of the our own nature of the mind or the tirikayas. For that reason,

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:29.600
 great master Lung Himba said in his teachings that everything is reflected from the dharmadhatu

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:35.520
 or the dharmakayas, dharmadhatus or dharmadhatu. Everything is reflected from dharmadhatu.

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:44.480
 There is nothing single object existing that which is not reflected from the dharmakaya.

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:50.240
 What that dharmakaya is talking about? We are not talking dharmakaya of someone else.

00:17:50.240 --> 00:18:00.080
 We are talking to our individualists. Our is all our environment. My environment, for example,

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:09.840
 my individually, my environment, everything is really display reflection of my own dharmakaya

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:20.480
 nature, nature of the mind, my own dharmakaya, my own mind. There's nothing else beside that.

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:29.440
 So everything is reflected from the from these dharmatas. And how what great master Lung Himba said

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:40.400
 is this reflection of what you see externally. It's like ornament, ornament of our great awareness.

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:48.880
 Ornament or it is a luxury of our awareness mind. It's all

00:18:48.880 --> 00:19:00.000
 luxury. When this like when this luxury ornament or this when our mind or the dharmadhatu is

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:09.920
 reflected in the in the in the externally lead as the poem systems, then all these universes,

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:19.360
 our environment is appeared appeared. It is like it is a display of the poems of the our

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:26.880
 awareness minds. When sound systems are everything what is heard what you see is then sound system

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:34.800
 display, luxury display of our minds. And then as well as our all thought and the conceptions,

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:44.880
 whatever we may have, all is luxury display of our again, nature of the mind or the request.

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:53.360
 Reality even you see all this display everywhere and so many things, nothing is moved or nothing

00:19:53.360 --> 00:20:00.480
 is changed out of the dharmadhatus or out with true natures. Everything is within that natural

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:01.360
 status,

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:06.160
 dharmadhatu status. So that is the really the how everything for that reason, here,

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:17.280
 here all this is display of one's own single awareness, dharmata, the true natures. There is

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:24.160
 nothing else is existed. So this is order to get these realizations. Of course, we are discussing

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:29.040
 a little bit of kind of intellectual level or like in reading the books that but when you got

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:35.920
 going to bring this realization that intellectual idea, you have to bring to realization or your

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:43.840
 your own really see vividly as it is, order to that, then we have to follow all the instructions

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:51.600
 as we received, such as with the with the Mundo practices, rafujis, developing bodhisattvas,

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:58.640
 medulla offerings, and such as vajasato practices, gurugyoga practice, those all really have to be

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:07.760
 followed according to instructions. Once those are completed and then you put another practice

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:14.640
 as zoki teaching received. Then zoki teaching, of course, you all know we all heard this is

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:20.480
 highest teaching of the greatest teacher of the bodhisattva communities. Highest teaching,

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:27.360
 the most profound teachings. Why is the highest teachings? This in the teaching say there's two

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:35.040
 reasons, principal two reasons. One is zoki practices don't need effort.

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:45.520
 It's effortless practices. Second is reason, this is the all the other teachings of the bodhisattva

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:54.560
 that means all the according nine yana teachings. Until the zoki ati, all yanas, all the teachings

00:21:54.560 --> 00:22:03.920
 are teachings are designed to help to the conceptions. Help to the conception to the

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:12.800
 conceptions. What that means? Concepcion to the conceptions. And what the in Gaurbattantara said,

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:24.160
 in the teaching said, as long as the conception existing, that long Buddha gave the teaching to

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:35.040
 dispel conception teaching to discipline the conceptions or to tame t-a-m-e tame the conceptions.

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:43.680
 So that means it's all teachings are best on the conceptions to help to the conceptions.

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:51.440
 How that is, for example, if I say, when we heard the received the teaching of the impermanent,

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:57.120
 teaching of the impermanent is the conceptions.

00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:08.720
 What is helping? What is taming? Taming of the permanent notions, permanent conceptions.

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:16.880
 Taming, the permanent conceptions. When we heard the teaching of the bodhisattva,

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:26.480
 I'm talking related to the bodhisattva, relative bodhisattva. What is at the bodhisattva, relative

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:36.080
 bodhisattva is teaching of the conceptions. But what is helping? It will tame the conception of

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:48.480
 the ego clinging or self-important. Self-important is taming self-importance. When we received the

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:58.000
 teaching of the visualizations, what is does? It is its conceptions of visualization, its

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:58.480
 conceptions.

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:08.800
 That's what is also named creation stages, creation, C-R-E-A-T-I-O-N, I think creations.

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:17.120
 Who is creating? One's own mind and following the instructions. But what that will help

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:25.040
 is at that conception, the creation of taming is the only mundane, regimented conceptions.

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:33.360
 Creation stage, when we do the visualization, how flexible? When we're talking about the three

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:40.800
 samadhis, emanating, transforming, this and that, it's all just kind of almost like rolling.

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:50.160
 Almostly it is, what's it called, like waves and tides and ripples and just changing one

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:59.360
 upon another, totally flexible. But our regiment only the conception is a regiment. It's a

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:08.720
 conception but regiment. Where is kind of fixed mind? Single pointed mind, this have to be this,

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:15.120
 this have to be that. Where are we making that? It's all in the brain, all in the conception.

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:22.960
 There is no different compartment of this, fixing that, fixing that, fixing. It's all made up

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:33.600
 our mind. Ask ourselves if it's true or not. We mixed, fixed out those things. None of those,

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:40.240
 they couldn't, couldn't, those fixations, none of those came when we was born.

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:52.000
 All that fired up, one after another, just fired up one after, become, then this and that and that,

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:59.760
 also they can't really become so many elaborated ones. But reality is conception. Visualization

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:11.280
 is, then it's very flexible, dynamic and open. It means though conception, it's changing the

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:18.720
 structure of the long running of our habit patterns. Really it's kind of completely undermining.

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:24.240
 Many times people practice and they think, oh it's kind of scary.

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:33.920
 Scary, sometimes they sit. But who is scared again? It's conception. Where is that scary existing,

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:40.560
 analytically, counter physically level, which somebody ask, where that existing?

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:50.880
 Everything, nothing, is all bubbles in the spaces of the mind, mind.

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:59.840
 So therefore, until the zouki teaching is, is helping to the conception, conception

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:11.600
 help to the conceptions. Zouki is not conceptions, according to you. One, you really recognize the

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:17.840
 nature of the mind, moment is introduced by the teachers and you click to that nature.

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:28.880
 That is the absolute existence. It's not conception. It's out of the freedom, free from the

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:37.920
 conceptions. For that reason, zouki is, is the built practice of the beyond the conceptions.

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:44.800
 So that reason, reason, one of that, that is one reason, therefore this is the highest teaching.

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:50.640
 There's no need, effort said. Effort is of course very important.

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:57.280
 But ultimately, when we are making effort, it's again structural.

00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:06.000
 Structural, it is making up things, making up things. For those reasons, what in the teaching

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:16.640
 said, my great master, in one of his teaching said, don't, don't contrived, don't contrived,

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:26.240
 don't corrupt, and don't contrived your own mind. Don't grasping, don't grasping to one's own mind.

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:39.920
 If you contrived, it will stir up the dusting of the mind. But if you relax, mind will bring the

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:47.840
 refined pristine qualities in mind. Therefore, don't contrived or don't make any effort.

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:58.320
 Don't try to make something. Just relax. Be is this. Carefree, those all in zouki teaching said,

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:04.320
 once it reach. For that reason, zouki, generally there's two zouki. So when we come to the zouki

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:12.880
 practice, these two zouki, tikku practices of the zouki and toga practice of the zouki that you all

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:21.040
 know to practice. But regularly, this tikku practice is known as the practicing of the casual,

00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:29.600
 relaxed, calm, peacefully, be in that natural status, without any contraptioning, without

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:37.920
 trying to do anything. So when you got these realizations, then the all is within the display,

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:44.960
 within the display of the true nature, what's called all this display of one's own single

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:53.440
 evenness, dharmata in the true nature. So that means all this nature, form, sound, and as well

00:29:53.440 --> 00:30:01.440
 as smell, taste, all the display of the all five senses, as well as object of five senses,

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:02.480
 everything

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:10.080
 within the natural state. There's nothing else outside. And be relaxing in that natural status.

00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:15.680
 When you have that realization of the true naturals of one's own awareness, there is nothing to be

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:22.400
 really what that going to help or what that going to hurt me. All is just completely pleased. There

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:22.640
's

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:29.840
 nothing, none of those exist at all that within that space, dharmata. Then all is not really even

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:37.360
 that is. And is the code that is called then for that reason, so called nirvana and samsara

00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:43.120
 is the labels, is the label of the conceptions. There's in again, there's not none of those

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:49.760
 existing on the absolute levels or this true nature of the nature of the mind's mind. And

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:56.640
 therefore, this hops and peers is all is just the names. Now, in that according then generated in

00:30:56.640 --> 00:31:02.480
 the Buddha's teaching or in the Buddhist practice, we hoping for the nirvanas, we can't really

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:02.720
 trying

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:10.960
 to be skipped from the samsaras. So this hop and a samsara, hop and peer is really the generally

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:18.320
 fundamental cause of the of the samsara and the nirvanas. But when you have got the realization of

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:26.000
 the true nature of our own mind, then this hop and peers are completely kind of like no

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:35.440
 meanings, no substantial existing is all, just only the names. And when you recognize the

00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:42.240
 ordinary inherited wisdom as it is, and that is then again, of course, when you recognize the

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:49.680
 ordinary inherited your wisdom, which means your our own nature of the mind. When you recognize

00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:55.280
 that in order to recognize those in a minute, zokki teaching and other teachings, how that

00:31:55.280 --> 00:32:03.120
 mentioned. And firstly, discovered what is mind and because mind is so important to all of us,

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:10.480
 ask what is really mind and those old instructions it and the teachings we applied and particularly

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:19.200
 such as like, where mind come from, where is mind now, where mind goes, kind of taking of all this

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:26.800
 about the mind in three different ways. When you see there is not none of those really, you have

00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:35.440
 any answers. Then what is mind? What left out? There's nothing that you can we can tell pinpoint.

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:42.480
 When you according the teaching, when you reach to that point, it surely really you are beholding

00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:52.080
 the nature of the mind, you are beholding, you are seeing the glimpse of the how the mind is.

00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:59.360
 When we reach the speechless status, when we ask those questions, what mind in the past,

00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:06.560
 what mind is now, what mind is the future. When you ask to myself or to our self,

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:15.520
 what answer we have, there's no answers, according to Buddha's teaching, although great master's.

00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:24.240
 We reach to the speechless status. That moment almost we can see what when we join the heart

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:32.400
 subtle practice at the beginning, inexpressible, inconceivable, that we really experiencing that

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:45.760
 inexpressible, inconceivable. We can't see anything. That is nature of the mind, according to the

00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:52.640
 teaching. But together there's precious realizations. Of course, according to the teaching, we have

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:52.800
 to

00:33:52.800 --> 00:34:00.720
 have good those like foundations of the merits, accumulation merits, all those really do as much

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:08.400
 as we with devotion, bodhicata, and that all will activate it. When you have that realization,

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:14.880
 then what in the teachings you said that the teacher or the when you receive the introduction

00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:21.440
 of the introduction or the pointing out the instructions of the nature of the mind, when

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:27.920
 you really recognize that nature of the mind, now what how you have to maintain in the according

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:35.360
 to the teaching, you will maintain that or maintain or meditate that really three immovable ways.

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:45.680
 Those three immovable ways, immovable of the body, immovable of our senses, immovable of our

00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:54.080
 awareness, immovable ways. Three immovable ways will maintain meditate that. When we get that

00:34:54.080 --> 00:35:01.440
 with that meditation, how we do our conduct. Conduct in the teaching is through the liberating

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:12.320
 conduct. Liberating as it arises, not analyzing, not following the law differently, even this,

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:20.320
 but all mental even this, and liberating right at his own dungeon, which he said here too.

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:30.480
 Sit here and in the in following lines here, if through arising, if toward arising, let them come

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:40.000
 and let be self-liberated, self-liberating that, that, so self-liberated. So this means how, how

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:40.080
 this

00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:49.650
 is actually, I said again maybe I just go one more again. So when you recognize the origin

00:35:49.650 --> 00:35:50.160
 inherited

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:56.640
 in the wisdom as it is, whether this through the instructions of the teachings or through the

00:35:56.640 --> 00:36:02.640
 interpreting out the teachings of the qualified teachers, when you recognize that nature of the

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:12.480
 mind, then there's nothing to do. Continue to maintain that nature status. He said that activity

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:19.200
 will only add delusion. So there's nothing else to do, nothing else particularly really to perform

00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:28.480
 any effort length, just relaxing in that natural status. As I said just now, just say that and

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:38.400
 relaxing with three movable, three immovable ways. Relaxing body, relaxing sense, relaxing mind,

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:50.320
 that tenuous. And what do you need according to the teaching? Keep the mindfulness, mindfulness of

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:58.000
 the very gentle mindfulness if I translate it or otherwise in the teaching said mindfulness of,

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:06.240
 mindfulness of the ordinary natures. Relax, this is not also trying to watch,

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:15.520
 our thought is not watching someone else. But just relax, relax, be aware, maybe I will use the

00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:15.840
 word

00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:26.400
 aware, be aware, relax in a natural status. That is, relax. And then when that happens, any thought

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:35.440
 during that time comes, any thoughts come, let that go, freely hears it. Let stay naked mind,

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:43.680
 naked awareness. Our mind, our awareness, the ordinary awareness is naked. That means it's

00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:53.250
 fresh. This is not cover up anything. Let it go as it is without analyzing, without holding

00:37:53.250 --> 00:37:53.840
 anything

00:37:53.840 --> 00:38:02.640
 or any letters. Let it go, let it go. When you're able to do that, then everything becomes

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:10.000
 meditation. Everything becomes as natural status. So there is no kind of division between

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:19.040
 meditating and not meditating. It's also all name. Reality you are or we are in a natural status,

00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:26.240
 natural state without covered up by the delusions or deluded by the delusions.

00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:36.800
 And during that time, whatever thoughts arising, let that thought arising, whatever it is arising,

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:45.440
 don't prevent thoughts, hears it. Let that come thoughts. But as it comes, naturally as it comes,

00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:53.680
 you also let it go, naturally, without analyzing. As wind comes in the sky,

00:38:54.720 --> 00:39:03.040
 wind comes, wind goes. Just let as it is. It's the blowing energy of the mind, thoughts are

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:08.720
 blowing energy of mind or another word in the teaching said it is display of the nirmakayas.

00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:16.720
 Those all let it come, let it go, but you relax or we relax on the present state of the nature of

00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:16.880
 the

00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:26.560
 mind. Relax. Then, if it's not towards arising, let also be that state. You don't have to do

00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:34.720
 anything. Be relaxed. During that time, any kind of like those errors of the of the meditator,

00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:46.480
 meditation is what in teaching said here. Here, topper and skater in mind. Topper and skater.

00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:54.320
 Those are the errors of the meditation. Those are also comes naturally. It's nothing that we made

00:39:54.320 --> 00:40:01.760
 any efforts or anything that, but when that those comes, again, immediately trying to be aware of

00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:13.920
 that situation. So where f is is like topper or sinking mind. Sinking mind. Yeah, topper or the

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:21.440
 sinking mind. Saying is intubated word means sinking mind or it also means means it is really

00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:29.200
 become mind, become all kind of like dull, dull, sleepy and just a poggy and the kind of like

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:40.960
 almost no clarity. That is sinking. Sinking. So if that happened, that is the obstacles of the

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:50.240
 meditation and as well as also skated mind and kind of completely restless. Just one after another

00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:57.280
 towards the coming. This is so kind of more rapidly one after another disturbing our meditation.

00:40:57.280 --> 00:41:04.960
 Both are errors of the meditation. So trying to moment if they're coming whether it is sinking,

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:11.680
 whether it's a skater and trying to take care of that. How to take care of those? In the teaching

00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:19.600
 said, sinking mind, you try raise up your awareness more on the high kind of on the head

00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:28.240
 or even kind of like looking. Raise up your consciousness. At the same time, you can also

00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:38.640
 look eyes a little bit up in the sky and widely open wide eyes. Relax that and also you can do

00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:46.320
 maybe if you are alone can do breathing for a particular exercise or exhale strongly.

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:54.320
 Increasing, increasing the of the devotions and bodhicata. Reflecting strongly bodhicata.

00:41:54.320 --> 00:42:00.240
 May all living be self-happiness and the cause of happiness. Maybe they free from the sufferings

00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:07.760
 or cause of suffering. Really strongly think reflecting the meaning that to those worlds

00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:15.200
 and joining that all strong feeling of the richness, preciousness and the devotions

00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:22.000
 to the buddha dharma sangha, to the lineage, all my lives. Or reflecting sometimes to the

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:29.360
 like in permanent. Life is in permanent. But how lucky I am. I'm still here. I'm practicing.

00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:36.080
 I'm helping. I'm doing good things. Can't bring those attitudes for a few moments. It will help

00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:43.120
 with the sinking mind. And it will help without those my mental activity will help with those

00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:50.080
 skater minds. It will really settle down our minds. It will help both. And then

00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:58.960
 so those are the we need those immediately here said said here that if the port of the

00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:06.240
 meditation topples and skater should arise dispelled and them on the spot. So that means

00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:14.880
 just immediately right there take care and let that go and take care. When that when you do

00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:21.840
 those things what is then it will come all the the what's called then it will bring the

00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:28.400
 perfect clarity. Perfect clarity of the nature of the mind and that is which is known as when

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:36.080
 clear light pervades both night and day without any interruption. So that means now you those

00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:43.920
 practitioner can maintain our zokki status or awareness status day and the night is night is

00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:51.840
 during the daytime you maintain continually that awareness and the request status in the nighttime.

00:43:51.840 --> 00:44:00.240
 Also you go with that with that meditation over that status and that is known as day merging the

00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:07.600
 day and the night in the clay light status. So what that clay light state is then everything

00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:15.120
 become as enlightened states of the three guys as we're talking early that dharma kaya sambokaya

00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:22.800
 state of nature of the mind all is really become in that status and that moment when you reach

00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:30.640
 reach that status that is then also the result of the enlightenment that is it's enlightenment

00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:36.080
 when you reach that status and then there is nothing do we have to wait waiting result for

00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:43.520
 the future is then how wonderful that is that there is no need to hope to result in the future

00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:52.400
 lives and so that so here is it please practice diligently in this way as as mentioned to you all

00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:59.960
 and thus written by writing and sent by the right he dodgy so that is breathe talks all the summ

00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:00.320
aries

00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:06.080
 of these teachings and again what is this teaching we mentioned what his own dungeon which

00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:06.480
 mentioned

00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:13.440
 here here say this as i said early many times is the condensed really teaching of the entire

00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:19.360
 buddha buddha's teaching how to practices practices and buddha teaching is generally

00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:27.040
 big and very deep what's called almost 35 years what 45 years teachings

00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:33.520
 buddha give 45 years teachings and those teachings are really so many but we summarize all those

00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:39.520
 teaching for the practitioners for the simple way this is what the really teaching is this is the

00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:45.440
 great master his own dungeon which even teaching and here i said i sent to here said to the

00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:52.320
 portioner ones i give this instructions so this portion that means who they are we all are

00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:58.750
 fortunate ones we all connected to these teachings we all connected to teaching of the buddha shakt

00:45:58.750 --> 00:45:59.040
amuni

00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:08.080
 and we are truly fortunate ones we are and therefore to make our such a fortunate one

00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:13.680
 we are fortunate one therefore even to make more fortunate and put this practice to the heart

00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:20.720
 and that is what and he said to to make the simple way what in the teaching often said

00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:27.280
 simple way to make the meaning of our own spiritual lives meaningful spiritual lives

00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:34.000
 and his whole dungeon we said one of these in his teachings the the the everything you didn't

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:40.320
 reach highest realization highest realization it is life but if we leave this world when we leave

00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:51.040
 this world without any regrets and we leave this song with with happy happy peaceful kind of if we

00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:59.600
 leave that actually even his whole dungeon would say that is good result that is good leave with

00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:09.760
 this world with happy content that is sign of the good practitioners really if we leave this world

00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:19.200
 with a regret and disappointment then that is not good so therefore at least and for that reason

00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:25.120
 he will give the instructions of the how to take rafu and then we went through all the rafu

00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:25.920
 practices

00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:32.000
 we went both together we went six parama das we extended that and then he his own the unit

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:39.830
 highlight portrayals of the all the practitioners portrayals and so those portrayals if we had

00:47:39.830 --> 00:47:40.080
 those

00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:47.040
 portrayals or richness we will be always reach of the practice our practice will be ever last

00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:54.960
 can we ever pressure lasting fresh fresh and strong energetic and always really advancing

00:47:54.960 --> 00:48:01.840
 that we don't have to be disappointed ourselves feel bad we will be so happy this practice will

00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:09.200
 will really keep our mind more healthy physical more healthy and then not just ours but it also

00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:17.520
 some degree we can help to the others others so nice and very peaceful very natural levels to
