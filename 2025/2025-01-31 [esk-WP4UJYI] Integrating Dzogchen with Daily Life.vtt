00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.240
 The fourth meditation or the value of the conduct or the value of not meditating is, then, is

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.260
 called the three-conducts.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:18.190
 Those are known as the word "great master" or "great teacher", "great master" in Gurba Masambharsi,

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:18.720
 in his teacher.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:28.880
 Exeternal conduct, inward conduct, civic conduct, those are three-conducts.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:36.040
 Exeternal conduct is the physical conduct.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:45.780
 Physical conduct, external conduct is, then, followed according to the Pundreghya teaching of the

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:46.320
 Buddha.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:53.960
 The Buddha's teaching. That Pundreghya teaching of the Buddha's conduct is completely based upon

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.840
 the mindfulness and alertness and consciousness.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:13.320
 What that conduct is? Conduct of the body, conduct of speech, so good our conduct, activity, really

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.320
 mind, activity of the body, activity of speech,

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:29.800
 God with mindfulness, alertness, and consciousness. Always pause, always remember.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:40.440
 And even the Gurba's teaching said, "conduct should be timidhi, timidhi, t-i-m-i-dhi."

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:54.120
 Conduct should be timidhi, and conduct should be thoughtful and mindfulness, the physical conduct.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:03.760
 And that means your own conduct will become very beautiful, calm, peaceful, soothing, calming,

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:09.200
 thoughtful, appealing, and not too much reactions.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:18.520
 Too much conduct, bumpy, so the outer conduct is like Pundreghya teaching of the Buddha.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:25.520
 In a conduct, as great Master Gurba and Master Samba said, "follow the suttaras."

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:34.320
 So that means in a conduct, follow the Mahayana. What that means?

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:44.690
 Mahayana is conduct, in a conduct, is conduct of the mind, conduct of the mind or the Mahayana,

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:57.080
 more compassion, more loving-kindness, more respect, more appreciation, more thankful.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:08.410
 That nobody see externally, but inwardly, really have more joy, more appreciation, more love, more

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.840
 compassion, more respect.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:20.240
 And then that will also reflect into the physically, verbally become more gentle, peaceful, but

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.360
 inwardly.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:28.880
 Mental conduct is bodhicata conduct, or sitting in inner conduct.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:38.300
 The single conduct is Vaidyana conduct. Vaidyana conduct is a fearlessness, not too doubt and not

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.800
 hesitating, hesitating and not too narrow-minded.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:53.320
 The vastness or the purest motivations see every day as an enlightened status.

00:03:53.320 --> 00:04:02.400
 This is not just making up that. All the forms are enlightened. All the songs are enlightened.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.520
 Songs. All the space of mind is enlightened.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:15.270
 And embracing that nature by the instructions of the teachings will be seen, such as known as

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.440
 visualizations, complete stage practices.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:25.240
 And that complete stage, the visualization stage is not two different directions.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:34.370
 The union, union of the two stages, correction stage, visualization stage, union of them, seeing

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:35.360
 everything,

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:44.120
 bring more purity, more divine qualities in the heart and mind, not let, carried and deluded or

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.080
 arrested by the Divine.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.080
 Vaidyana is the practice of the breath and dualities.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:58.960
 So inwardly or secretly have that fellowship stage.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:06.480
 Even you have the highest realization of the Vaidyana teaching. Everything is a divine status.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:15.840
 Everything is a purely status and as eternal, all are exactly same as spiritual teachings.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:26.800
 With thoughtful, with mindfulness, with cautiousness and alertness, with terminus.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:34.180
 And all those, such as, like, in this life, his life, such as great masters, masters we saw, his

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.360
 only the union.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:41.520
 His only thing of Jesus. His only Dalai Lama. Now, now we see.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:50.720
 They are really according to Vaidyana. They are highest realization, but yet, they are humble and

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:51.680
 simple.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:06:01.520
 And follow the exactly external guidelines of the Buddhas, as the Phonika teaches.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:13.920
 And then inwardly, secretly, a human control, bodhijana, mahayana control, love and compassion.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:18.000
 That we say simply is bodhijana.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.080
 Now, even you have the highest, even your highest realization.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:29.200
 Realization, everything is divine, mandala, polka. Everything you see as a Buddha.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:38.880
 And everything is enlightened, all, everything, but your love and compassion, completely saturated.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:44.320
 And filled heart with love and compassion, everything. That is our goal.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:49.600
 It's really when you're corner teaching, when you got the highest, as much as your, you got the

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.840
 realization of the true nature.

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:59.120
 The skull or the rupa, nature of the mind, that much love, that much compassion, that much vajnam

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.200
 is really growing.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:09.620
 In the Buddha teaching, those who are highly enlightened, their love and compassion comes as their

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:12.240
 realization, highest.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:18.800
 There's no one has highest realization and no love, no compassion. That's never happening.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:29.600
 If that's not happening, then their realization is cushionable, not right.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:34.950
 Therefore, love and compassion, as you see in the teaching sit, as much as you got the realization

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:41.600
 of the emptiness or realization of the true nature of the mind,

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:49.920
 that much love and compassion comes, just so strong. That's why all those great masters, so

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:53.280
 compassionate, so kind,

00:07:53.280 --> 00:08:02.880
 so really, so like, just humble and simple. Those are in the teaching sit. So that is the conduct.
