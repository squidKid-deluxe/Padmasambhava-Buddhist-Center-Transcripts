00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.950
 This is one of the very beautiful moments in our life and again we are reconnecting with the

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:07.500
 teaching of the Buddha.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:15.000
 Buddha, which is the nature of ours, Buddha teaching is not something that Buddha proclaiming

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.100
 somebody else and saying something and we have to do that.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:26.440
 Buddha teaching is what is saying, pointing out how we have to relieve people of our beautiful

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:34.490
 richness, precious qualities, to make the rich and precious very special in our lives and lives of

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.100
 others.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:45.010
 That is and with beauty, love, kindness, compassion, joy, with vision and goal and advancing,

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.600
 courage and commitment and confidence.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:55.300
 All that is what really Buddha is pointing out. All these lineage masters pointing out of that and

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.600
 how wonderful, how beautiful we are.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.390
 We connect to such beautiful, great teaching. It is not just our kind of like something we are

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.100
 special, this and that, but our important, we are very important beings because we are connected.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.240
 We have beautiful calmness to connect to such a great teaching, great lineage teaching of non-vol

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.100
ence, love and kindness and compassion.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.630
 So therefore again, this is one of the very beautiful moments in our life and it is strength and

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:29.100
 joy and appreciation and that is what we need practices, that is what we are going to do.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:36.610
 Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, in the midst of all the samsara situation, there are so many old tremors

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.100
 going in every different direction in one way, we think that there are so many.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.550
 But here is something really, we have the window of light, we have beautiful, everything is quite

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.600
 good, everything is quite rich, everything is beautiful.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:54.510
 To compare with so many other things happening in the world, even in this world, which is known as

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.820
 human world, which is one of the upper realms according to the teaching, which has so many good

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:00.100
 things.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:07.060
 But still, to compare with them, to compare, to look to us, we have lot of richness, beautiful joy

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:14.100
 and appreciation, igniting those who are grateful, gratitude is practicing with them.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:20.470
 With this beautiful thought, and then with the bodhicata, kindness is compared to all living with

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:27.100
 this vastness, vastness, motivation of the bodhicata, increasing that of the beautiful thought.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:33.920
 And then to compare with this, again, the purely understand with nature or the purity, the very

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.100
 view of the way things are.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.100
 Trying to break that again, beautiful politics, that's what we are practicing, Vahiyana teaching.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.100
 Not just Vahiyana teaching, we are practicing zho ki.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:50.230
 Zho ki is according to the teaching, top of top, it's a cream of everything. That's what we are

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.100
 really connected to this.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:03:00.490
 So therefore, bring that kind of, make that situation, make that kind of environment to observe the

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.100
 greater teaching in our heart and mind.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:11.100
 Not covered by the skeptical and idea and thought and dark hesitation and all these kind of things.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:17.100
 Those are the mundane samsara, those are the samsara. We've been doing that whole lives.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:24.100
 And according to Vahiyana teaching, not just a life, but we've been doing that from the beginning

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.100
 of a lifetime, beginning of less times.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:30.570
 We've been doing that. We're tired, we're bored, we're sick, they didn't really lead us any further

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.100
 than what we are now.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:38.700
 Therefore, we like to change and we like to do exactly what these great masters did, great those

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.100
 practitioners did.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:45.170
 And therefore, supreme of the purity, understanding of that, that's what really will make the

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.100
 difference.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.100
 And to kind of observe all that is in the teaching, always, then the devotions.

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:56.100
 Devotion is so important. Devotion is also not just going one direction.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:03.100
 Devotion is in way 360 degree angles.

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:09.100
 Devotion means joy and applications and richness and dear of that.

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:17.390
 Joy and appreciation, richness of the lineage, dear and appreciation and joy and appreciate the

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.100
 feeling of my own self, your self.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:25.100
 And all the situations, we feel that, that is what it is.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.100
 Again, we're not just making up that. It's true that is what it is.

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:36.100
 So recognize that, bring up those, we call it on the sport light. Light is called devotions.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.100
 When we have the devotions, we settle down on the spiritual ground.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:45.100
 We're not just wondering as like lost chicken head everywhere.

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:50.100
 We will settle down on the ground. From there we can really grow and develop.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.100
 Without the devotions, again, nothing is kind of sufficient.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:58.100
 Enough, this and that and kind of looking and looking and looking, searching and searching.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:03.100
 Then we ask the goal. For that reason, it is okay to teach you what it's called.

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:08.100
 Three-grade world teaching of the garab borders, first and second and third.

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.100
 I mean, you heard those teachings, so many things.

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.100
 You heard this teaching, many of you and I heard too.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:21.100
 We all heard, what is second world? Second world, confirmed decision.

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.100
 There is something that I would just like and say is all in a debate.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:36.320
 One determination of confirmed, there's nothing more precious, more special, more better than the z

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.100
obchi teaching.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:44.700
 Every leg to remove the ego clinging, every leg to remove, change this lifestyle and reveal our

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.100
 primordial nature of wisdom.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:57.090
 Zobchi teaching, therefore, takkitō, you mean, we have concisely confirmed all like decisions,

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.100
 trustees, people.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:05.100
 Then, zobchi teaching is the best teaching and a powerful teaching.

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:09.100
 So, those all said, therefore, devotion is so important.

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:14.700
 With that, those understanding, again, we think of a few things about as we're going, as for

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.100
 renowned sessions.
