00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.400
 Thank you, friends. Always warm welcome. It's an honor and a joy to get to be here once again

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.720
 together and reflect on and absorb the meaning of the Dharma into our lives, into our hearts,

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.960
 into our minds. So, as Ven. Khewpo Rinpoche and all these lineage masters have encouraged

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.120
 us time and again, there are these three ways that we align ourselves with the living Dharma,

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:42.360
 that we become living Dharma. And these three ways are renunciation, bodhicitta, and pure

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:50.280
 perception. So renunciation or joyful, like a joyful, kind of gracious gratitude, kind

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:58.440
 of an alive, sparkling sense of kind of preciousness of what's happening. So we kind of activate

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.380
 that kind of direct, kind of relaxed, clear understanding of how precious this moment

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:12.040
 is, how special we are, our friends and family, this environment we're in, reflect on the

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:19.720
 Dharma, this living lineage that's sustaining the Dharma. We can use it to actually become

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:29.800
 enlightened for the benefit of all beings. And then secondly, we extend that for the benefit

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.560
 of all beings, like we're actually reflecting on this, we go for refuge so we can actually

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:43.840
 serve all beings, more skillfully help others feel happy right now and then long term forever.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.820
 And the only way to have long lasting happiness is to become free of suffering, the causes

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.520
 of suffering, this enlightenment. So we're really doing this with kind of this bright

00:01:52.520 --> 00:02:00.320
 motivation that made this become a like principle, ripe, rich, perfect condition for all beings

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:13.480
 to become happy and be free of all suffering and the causes so to be enlightened. And thirdly,

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:20.640
 activate this pure perception, this very close warm hearted connection to the Dharma. The

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.800
 Dharma not as just as some scriptural, textural thing, like a textual on kind of outer phenomena,

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:33.290
 but the living Dharma reality, the living reality of our environment, of ourselves and our

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.520
 environment,

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.520
 of all the other beings, the relationships between and through all of us. This is actually

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:45.280
 living Dharma. And that's naturally kind of a wise, it's naturally inclusive. It's already

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:51.920
 naturally functioning just fine. Reality is doing what reality does. And in one way, Vajrayana

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.280
 points to this with so much precision and detail, skillful means, points to this and

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:04.680
 calls it pure perception, this close warm hearted, connected, devoted kind of surrender to reality,

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.560
 the reality outside, inside and in between. This pure reality are like how our mind is

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.680
 when wisdom is allowed to do what wisdom does. When compassion is allowed to flow is compassion

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.480
 will. When we don't block that up, naturally flows wisdom and compassion. It's all pure

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:49.600
 perception. We activate that in our experience now. So the topic today, I thought to just reflect

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.760
 on

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:58.120
 and contemplate a little bit was accessing the power of belief, accessing the power of belief.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:08.760
 I think sometimes I kind of hear, kind of get a sense of and in myself feel like what we need

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:22.120
 to do is go beyond all these beliefs, dogma, blind faith, just belief, rote, belief, as if all the

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:30.360
 beliefs we have are just bad. They're all holding us back, inhibiting us, locking us up. And I

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.600
 think

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:37.360
 in terms of Buddha Dharma, specifically in Vajrayana, this is not true. There's a rare few

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.920
 accomplished

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:43.360
 individuals and Atty. Yoga, Zogchen, Mahasanti practitioners that actually have gone beyond all

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:50.680
 conceptual grasping. They don't need concepts or beliefs anymore. They're really beyond all views.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:58.480
 They no longer cling to any views. But up until that point, the ninth Yana or vehicle, every other

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:09.000
 vehicle or approach, every path, every Yana includes concepts. It uses concepts to then lessen the

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:17.240
 grasping onto those concepts. So in this way, belief isn't bad in and of itself. It's our grasping,

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:23.520
 just like we've heard so many times. It's our grasping onto the belief. It's our grasping onto

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:30.880
 the view. That's the problem. We don't need to erase reality. We don't need to erase these relative

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:38.830
 patterns. How could we ever? That's called nihilism. We're not trying to erase beliefs. We're

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:39.120
 trying to

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:45.120
 become more flexible and skillful with how we use them. So we can use these beliefs, these views,

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:53.520
 these patterns to actually include more reality, more of nature, more of Dharma, more Yanas. That's

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.760
 why the higher vehicles or Yanas include the lower Yanas and vehicles, but they transcend the

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:04.840
 limitations or the grasping onto those restricted patterns of just those kind of smaller or less

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:10.400
 inclusive ways of being with reality. They include the valuable contributions like Shravaka Yana,

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:17.360
 Bodhisattva Yana, outer Tantras, inner Tantras. Mzogchen includes all of these, but doesn't stay

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:24.240
 in any one set of these beliefs. It keeps going beyond them, beyond the grasping onto any one

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:31.560
 approach. So it's inclusive. This is kind of the general orientation or directionality of all the

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:38.400
 paths, according to Nyingma School, to become more inclusive of reality, but not just including

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:46.080
 things randomly, lining up with these patterned systems according to what's helpful. Not just

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:52.320
 throwing everything all together in a bucket, but actually being in a living ecology, being in a

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:57.960
 living vehicle, being in a living body, being in a living environment and lining up attuning with

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:04.960
 that environment, with that world. That's why view or a tawa can be thought of as a world. It's not

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:11.680
 just an idea we have and based on reality. A view or a tawa is a world view. We're literally

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:19.300
 making worlds moment by moment. Every moment begins with a view. The Buddha was so clear about this

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:19.400
.

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:26.280
 Venerable Kengpa Rinpoche has taught this so, so clearly. First, have a very clear view, then stand

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:32.400
 and walk on the path. Venerable Kengpa Rinpoche has emphasized this so many times over the years.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:41.980
 Clearly establish a view, then walk on the path. We need to be very precise about the view, about

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:42.120
 the

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:49.640
 pattern, the world we're in. Otherwise, how will we know what the meditation is? How will we know

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:55.000
 what our activity or behavior is? How will we know what the results going to be? Always these

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.800
 follow together as a complete and like coherent system of view, meditation, conduct, fruition.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:07.300
 Always is taught like this in Nyingma School of Tibetan Buddhism. So how do we use a view, a belief

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:07.480
,

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:15.680
 a world view, a filter? How do we use the whole world that it opens us to? That world we're making

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:22.960
 moment by moment. How do we use it so that it encourages and empowers us to have more kind of

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:30.440
 ability to bring about happiness of self and other, freedom of self and others? It's not a question

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:30.560
 of

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:38.320
 erasing views. It's going beyond the grasping onto any one view or one set of views, releasing the

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:44.120
 grasping and let the kind of nature, the world naturally do what the world would naturally do.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:49.920
 This is kind of oriented towards pure perception, like I mentioned a little bit earlier. So in

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:55.280
 general, there's three kinds of beliefs, three kinds of views. How do we access the power of these?

00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:05.160
 This is very general. There's negative beliefs, positive beliefs, and then going beyond belief.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:16.040
 Often the Rimbachis talk about this as negative duality, positive duality, non duality, or negative

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:22.800
 grasping, positive grasping, non grasping. This is taught by the Buddha. This is said to be the

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:32.040
 complete teaching of the Buddha, to give up harm, to do virtue, perform virtue, and tame your mind,

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:42.200
 be with your mind, nature of mind. So you look at this from the higher Rhyanas, Mahayana and then

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:49.080
 Sutra Mahayana, Tantra Mahayana. This is saying give up negative grasping, perform positive

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:56.180
 grasping, recognize non grasping, wisdom. So then simply put, this is the path of the two accum

00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:56.600
ulations,

00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:06.000
 perform merit, accumulate merit, and recognize and be wisdom. These are always said to be the two

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:12.720
 essential aspects of any path. The great Jama and Konta Rinpoche really emphasized this. Ground is

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:19.360
 relative and absolute truth. Path is two accumulations, merit and wisdom, positive grasping and non

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:27.240
 grasping. And the result is the two bodies, formless body and formed body, Rupakaya and Arupakaya.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:35.520
 Rupakaya's Rupakaya emphasizes so much. So here we're looking more at the path. Perform positive

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:45.640
 grasping, positive belief, go beyond belief, recognize non grasping wisdom mind. So in this

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:50.240
 way we're using positive grasping wherever our mind and heart are. We're using it as a leaping off

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:58.840
 point into wisdom. We use positive grasping to recognize non grasping. We use merit as a pattern

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:03.360
 system, as a view, a worldview, a world we're in. We use the world, we pay attention to the world,

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:09.440
 and we kind of kind of grow it in a flourishing, nutritious way so that we relax and let the world

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:16.080
 do what the world does. It's already intelligent. Our mind and heart are already intelligent. They

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:16.120
're

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:21.720
 already including, they already embrace, it's already compassion. This is key core Buddha

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:26.560
 nature teachings, third turning of the wheel of Dharma. Buddha nature is already there, outside

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:32.640
 and inside, in every single mind. We don't have to make it be there. We have to allow it to do what

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:38.160
 it does. Allow Buddha nature to shine as it shines. And the more inclusive the belief, the more

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:43.560
 inclusive the world, the more the Buddha nature shines on. This means the one way we can talk

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:52.640
 about this also is a coherence. The more coherent of you, the more inclusive of you, then the more

00:11:52.640 --> 00:12:00.280
 it allows Buddha nature to shine through it. So it's kind of a sutra mayana language, the less it's

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:07.840
 obstructed by emotional obscuration and cognitive obscuration. Buddha nature is just shining

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:08.240
 brightly

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:14.640
 because these are being removed. And these views, these beliefs we have, there's not just one big

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:20.400
 blanket belief, there's really very tangible beliefs, tangible patterns, really, really,

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:34.340
 really subtle patterns. But any way we orient is a belief. Any way we orient at all is a belief of

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:34.800
 you,

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:43.400
 a patterning system that we're aligning to, rules we're following, roles we're kind of, kind of

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:50.120
 sinking into. We don't have to erase these patterns or these roles or these rules. We have to go

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:50.360
 with

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:58.800
 them in a skillful way, oriented towards what? Greater inclusion, wisdom, more benefit, more

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:05.760
 self-other benefit. This is like the general thrust of bodhicitta, the heart, mind of enlightenment

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:05.760
,

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:11.080
 of the bodhisattva path. So these three things in one way, these are just some very general points.

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:17.120
 This is talking about we can't avoid belief because we always come with a view. What kind of view?

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:23.620
 There's negative views, positive views, and views that go beyond views, the nature of a view. There

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:23.680
's

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:29.270
 negative grasping, positive grasping, non-grasping. So we need to be real clear in my mind right

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:29.480
 now,

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:35.720
 my heart right now, what's locking it up? That would be negative. What's opening it up? The Buddha

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:40.880
 nature is coming out more, that's positive. And what's allowing it to just be what it is? That's

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:48.200
 non-grasping, that's wisdom beyond any view, any conceptual designation, any locking mechanism. No

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:57.680
 grasping, just free flow, mindful, open, attentive care and inclusion with intelligence, wisdom and

00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:03.640
 compassion. So that's kind of where we're orienting here. And what Vajrayana does is it really

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:14.760
 skillfully uses positive grasping in order to very actively kind of manifest wisdom. And so here we

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:20.290
 have two general approaches here. One way on the more sutra approach or the bodhisattva yana

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:20.760
 approach,

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:28.800
 this third yana, we're using a view, we're using a belief in order to recognize wisdom. We're

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:36.720
 approaching the goal, right? We use merit to relax into wisdom, our Buddha nature. And then from

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:36.920
 that

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:44.180
 side, once we're in Buddha nature, we use pattern, we use expression for wisdom to naturally

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:44.920
 connect

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:52.870
 up with and communicate with beings, other beings, and with more parts of ourselves. We include

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:53.240
 more

00:14:53.240 --> 00:15:00.950
 worlds, more views, more patterns, more of relative truth. Absolute truth naturally includes more

00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:01.120
 of

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:08.120
 relative truth. They're not in a big battle. This is not a dual thing anymore. Absolute includes

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:15.950
 relative, relative, orient towards absolute. But from the perspective of the goal of more tantramah

00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:16.240
ayana,

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:23.440
 we're using this grasping, positive grasping to recognize non grasping, going beyond views, locking

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:28.920
 into a view. And then from there, we allow the radiance of Buddha nature to naturally shine and

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:34.040
 do what it does. And it naturally syncs up with other beings. And it kind of lines up with their

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:40.900
 views, their beliefs, their patterns, their system. Why? Because it's trying to help beings. You

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:40.960
 have

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:45.410
 to like work with a being where they're at. That's why they say the Buddha never forced anything.

00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:45.760
 The

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:50.800
 Buddha just saw the disposition of the beings, the readiness of beings, according to what's

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:51.240
 available

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:55.000
 on my side, what's available on the other side, where does the alignment happen? Then the Buddha

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.520
 naturally flowed as Dharma teaching right there. Then everything with the Buddha's body, speech,

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:04.760
 and mind was teaching. Because there's a perfect attunement with reality, with Dharma. He was just

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:11.400
 pure 100% living Dharma, without any limit. The only limit is on the side of the being he's

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:17.480
 communicating with. Because what's that limit? The grasping of the view held by the sentient

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:22.920
 being. That's the only thing that limits a Buddha is our grasping, the sentient beings grasping.

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:23.800
 Other

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:28.200
 than that, Buddha is unrestricted. Why? Because there's no longer one Buddha who's outside of

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:32.440
 something else. But it doesn't hold an enlightened being doesn't hold themselves as being apart

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:32.680
 from

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:38.920
 some other system apart from relative truth, they include all relationality, just boundless,

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:46.520
 inexhaustible relationality, worlds upon worlds upon worlds upon worlds. Infinitely small worlds,

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:52.200
 big worlds. An enlightened being doesn't see themselves as some one player or one person or

00:16:52.200 --> 00:17:00.240
 being in it. They're everything. It's just boundless relationality. Omniscience, you see,

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:05.400
 perfectly see simultaneously every relative position. And they see the nature of them as

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:11.240
 being totally free of any fixation. No grasping, no reification, no exaggeration, no locking

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:16.600
 mechanism. Totally release all that so then everything naturally flows. That's what Buddha

00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:23.320
 nature does. When it's fully awakened is called enlightenment. Full awakening includes all the

00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:29.000
 views, all the nightmares of sentient beings, all the good dreams of sentient beings, and also sees

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:36.280
 their dreams. So this is kind of the general orientation of the path. And so in Vajrayana,

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:42.680
 we're like really skillfully trying to use this duality habit or grasping or locking into a view

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:50.140
 or a belief. We're trying to skillfully use that to include more worlds, to see more of the lay

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:50.520
ering

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:56.920
 of an experience, to see more of the richness of our minds, to include more of it, more of the kind

00:17:56.920 --> 00:18:04.060
 of like, you know, energy of our own intelligence. That's why we don't throw away things in Vajray

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:04.280
ana

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:10.360
 as a general approach. We're not throwing away emotions. We're not throwing out something

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:15.080
 negative. We're not emphasizing that something's broken and we're fixing it. The Vajrayana or

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:21.800
 tantramahayana approach isn't that. It's to recognize it's already Buddha nature. We're

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:27.080
 allowing it. We're relaxing into it. We're trying to let it self-correct. The Buddha nature knows

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:33.560
 what it needs to do. Our own wisdom and compassion knows what it needs to do. Oftentimes, even on a

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:41.320
 mundane level, we know what we need to do. Eat more greens. Get more regular sleep. Don't eat

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:48.990
 so much junk food. Scroll less. Meditate more. Be mindful of these things we know. Deep breath

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:49.240
 every

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:56.440
 now and then. Get some exercise. Be nice. We know all this stuff. It's not a lot of this path. We

00:18:56.440 --> 00:19:04.600
 know all these things, but we need to skillfully remind ourselves and really kind of get a more of

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:11.640
 an energetic kind of like passion about really wanting to do it. The great Sonam Khazi, he said

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:17.720
 the path is simple. We have to know what we need to do, know what we should do, and prefer it.

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:24.920
 Knowing what we need to do is virtue. Positive grasping. Preferring is we're no longer against

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:30.120
 it. This is like our life becomes an offering for other beings. We become gentle, disciplined,

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:36.920
 Sheila. We have Sheila or ethics, a gentleness, so that we like provide like a beautiful, loving

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:42.130
 opportunity for others to relax into. We calm our own flames of our negative emotions, our

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:43.080
 turbulence.

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:48.840
 So when others are around us, "Oh, I don't have anything to fear here. I can just be myself."

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:54.120
 People relax. That's a big Mahayana, Paramita practice of discipline.

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:57.480
 So that's what we're trying to do. Let the Buddha nature do what it does.

00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:04.920
 This is positive grasping, positive belief oriented towards non grasping or wisdom,

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:14.120
 going beyond belief, beyond the grasping of limited view. And so kind of, yeah, looking here.

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:22.040
 Okay. So specifically in Vajrayana, then this just really like blows the hinges off of anything we

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:28.920
 previously thought could possibly be. We can kind of very, kind of like abstractly talk about

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:35.160
 Vajrayana's orienting towards including more views or more worlds. But in the actual practice of it

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:35.160
,

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:43.320
 like in the dudrum tercer nundro, we're really boldly trying to boldly, clearly be with

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:52.280
 really out of the box, you know, multi-perspectival fullness. Like there's instantly a refuge tree.

00:20:52.280 --> 00:21:00.920
 And Guru Rinpoche is instantly there. And all the Dharma teachings are there. All the Bodhisattvas

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:07.640
 of the past, present, and future. All the great and noble Arhats. All these dakas and dakinis

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:12.280
 everywhere. And the eight Harukas and all the Harukas and Dharma Pala, Dharma protectors.

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:21.800
 Just like we're instantly in this world. We're like, in one way, pausing our doubt,

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:30.120
 our kind of, you know, flimsy conviction. We're like pausing that. Or in the other way,

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:35.480
 we're courageously embracing the vivid richness of our experience of reality.

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:42.120
 This could be true. Guru Rinpoche could be here. This whole refuge trees could be here. And I

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:50.280
 just been missing it. I just didn't see enough. So in one way, we're just like vigorously,

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:54.920
 kind of like courageously with vajra kind of awareness with beautiful kind of like

00:21:54.920 --> 00:22:01.480
 open, open-hearted, like kind of confident joy. Like this is an enlightened mandala now,

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:04.200
 an enlightened world, sacred world.

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:10.200
 And on the outset, we use that as a belief.

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:18.840
 In visualization or the creation stage practice, Karim, it's called Samaya Sattva. As one example,

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:26.920
 we use an imagined belief structure. What's the Buddha? What's the Ratnu? What's the Buddha

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:33.080
 holding? What's the Buddha represent? What colors? What ornaments? What implements? What are they

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:36.330
 doing? What's the purpose? These are all beliefs, positive beliefs. We're like literally using a

00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:41.800
 map

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:47.160
 of a pure sacred world, a mandala, and we're conceptually kind of like holding it in place.

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:55.000
 And then what we're trying to do is recognize that it's already there. That's the jhana safa,

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:03.000
 the wisdom being. So we use an imagined kind of map, an imagined world. So we can just actually

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:09.800
 courageously see this mandala is already here. It's the very living fabric of reality.

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:15.800
 And it's not a fixed frozen view. It's not a fixed frozen pattern of reality.

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:21.640
 Guru Rinpoche can appear as Chenrezig and can appear as Amitabha, and it can appear

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:27.400
 wrathfully and semi-wrathfully and peacefully and with a consort, without a consort. I mean,

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:32.680
 the nature is totally flexible. This emptiness, this is firmly established in middle way manyamaka

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:39.640
 teachings. Bodhisattva jhana. Flexible. We're not trying to fixate on one mandala. We're trying

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:45.000
 to see as transcendental wisdom rainbow body mandala. It's totally fluid, flexible, empty nature,

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:52.680
 empty of what? Grasping. Free flow mandala that has pattern, has direction, has color,

00:23:52.680 --> 00:24:01.320
 has meaning, has lights go out, lights come in. It's not just some blank space of dharmakaya.

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:07.720
 It's filled with the richness of sambogakaya and nirmanakaya, a form of pure pattern.

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:13.430
 This is pure relative truth. And this is something that in my experience, I look around a little

00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:13.560
 bit

00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:17.320
 at different things happening in the world, a little bit. I mean, now there's infinite things

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:22.200
 to look around and myself too. There's already been so many things, but most people don't want

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:30.920
 to touch this from what I've seen. Sacred world. They're actual deities around. They're actual

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:38.120
 buddhas. They're actual bodhisattvas, not just imagined bodhisattvas, an image of a Buddha.

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:46.360
 But actually, this room has buddhas in it. Actually, my body has enlightened beings in it.

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:53.240
 There's actual enlightened activity happening here, there, and everywhere all the time.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:01.320
 This is pure relative truth. This is the specific kind of part of the fourth turning that Buddha

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:10.840
 emphasized. It's not impure relative truth. Nothing's broken. It's all just mandala.

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:14.360
 Pure relative truth, pure body, pure speech.

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:22.360
 Pure mind, that's the wisdom. So Vajrayana is so bold. And like in Tibetan Buddhism,

00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:27.800
 this is essential, nuts and bolts, like very kind of fundamentally essential.

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:34.120
 The galactic civilizations of pure relative truth happening everywhere

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:41.240
 is a tantra, not just as some technique we do or some process we undergo to transform

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:48.040
 ourselves. It's actually a recognition of pure worlds and activities, inhabitants,

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:55.000
 container and contained, pure worlds that are already happening now, of enlightened beings

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:02.800
 doing enlightened activity as the very fabric of reality. This is tantra in a Buddhist tantra sense

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:02.840
,

00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:07.160
 not just breathing a lot and all of a sudden I get in some heightened state.

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:13.720
 It's recognizing pure relative truth that I can use a technique, a skillful means to

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:18.920
 see that more clearly, more fully, more brightly, more easily. But what I'm seeing is something

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:26.200
 I'm not creating. It's the way reality is if I only kind of rest and relax enough,

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:32.360
 if my Buddha nature comes out enough. They said that this is what all these great masters who

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:37.640
 accomplished, they all saw this. Then they could do amazing miraculous things like pulling

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:44.920
 terma teachings out of mid-air or rock or jumping into the lake, pulling out candles

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:46.920
 that are on fire, all these kind of amazing things.

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:57.240
 As Tibetan Buddhists, we cannot sacrifice this part of Tibetan Buddhism, pure relative truth.

00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:03.880
 It's not just formless. It's not just emptiness. This is not Tibetan Buddhism.

00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:08.280
 That's established in Bodhisattva Yana, that's established in the second turning,

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:13.480
 emptiness of outer and inner, beyond conceptual designation, grasping on the concepts. That's

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:19.160
 firmly established by the Buddha in the third turn, third Yana, the third vehicle. Then there's

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:23.960
 Yana's four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. They firmly established pure relative truth,

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:30.760
 not just pure body, but pure speech and pure mind. That's called pure relative truth, tantra.

00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:40.840
 There are actual deities, pure body, an actual mantra, pure sound, outside, inside, in between,

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:48.120
 all divine mandala, sacred world, not something I'm creating, something that is.

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:57.000
 And I use creations, positive grasping, like imagining that I'm a deity or imagining that

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:02.600
 Guru Rinpoche is in front of me. I use that positive grasping, positive belief to recognize

00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:08.520
 Guru Rinpoche is actually already in front of me. Guru Rinpoche is actually in me.

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:15.560
 Wow, boldly, so bold. I actually am Guru Rinpoche. Every single being can say that.

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:19.880
 And it'd be true, absolute Guru Rinpoche, the nature of one's own mind.

00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:28.680
 Not just sky, but all the relative pure patterns of how that nature displays. Not as a path to

00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:35.640
 get to the sky, but as the way the energy arises within the sky-like mind, pure relative truth.

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:44.680
 This is wisdom and its vast display. Skillfully, we use the kind of positive grasping, positive

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:51.240
 belief, Samaya Saffa, imagination. We use that to recognize wisdom. And then within wisdom,

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:58.120
 the more we relax into wisdom, into jhana, into our own kind of pure mind, the more we can do that,

00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:04.120
 the greater the aperture, the greater the inclusion of the views of the patterns we can include,

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:09.640
 more, more, more, more, more relative truth. And then we include two aspects of relative truth,

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:15.000
 the subtle, subtle relative truth and the very macro big relative truth.

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:22.040
 So that's just like zooming in and out, like in a Google map. We're including the full range of

00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:27.560
 relative truth. And then how are we including relative truth? We're including the impure part,

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:36.600
 the nightmare distorted vision, and the pure part. Pure body, pure speech, all the different wisdom

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:41.800
 mandalas of all the infinite varieties as they phase in and out of each other, depending on what's

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:48.840
 helpful for sentient beings to wake up. So these two aspects of relative truth, we're including

00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:54.360
 the full spectrum of relative truth from small to big, from outer to inner, from the whole range

00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:59.880
 of relationality. And then we're also including a different mode of experiencing relative truth,

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:04.680
 impure relative truth, pure relative truth. That's a mode or a way of seeing.

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:13.000
 That turns on with Tantramahayana, Yana's four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. So like, for example

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:13.000
,

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:18.600
 Buddha already taught there's six realms. He taught that in the outermost teaching, first vehicle.

00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:25.240
 This is already way more relative truth, this is impure relative truth, and it's way more impure

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:30.890
 relative truth that almost any modern, postmodern, whatever you call them, person is willing to

00:30:30.890 --> 00:30:31.320
 accept.

00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:38.280
 The Buddha said, this is how it is. There's all kinds of hell beings and hungry ghost beings and

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:45.320
 animals and asuras, anti gods and god realms, gods, and so many of them. That's all impure relative

00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:51.720
 truth, but it's full, much more full richness than what we're willing to accept now to believe in.

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:58.200
 In addition, the Buddha said, well, once you get into this kind of more like Buddha nature

00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:02.440
 starts to function more fully and you use skillful means to awaken more kind of completely,

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:06.760
 then all of a sudden you start seeing all these pure things you totally missed before,

00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:10.600
 that we missed. There's all these Buddhas everywhere, there's all these enlightened

00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:14.840
 activities happening everywhere, it's actually what's really happening. Everything else is just

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:19.880
 this distorted kind of jaundice vision, it's a mistaken perception. All impure relative truth

00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:25.880
 is not actually natural, it's totally made up, it's utter hallucination. And this is interesting,

00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:31.630
 because from the Tantra view, then all these other ways of we think are so real, like I'm in a

00:31:31.630 --> 00:31:32.040
 temple,

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:36.440
 my name is Rakpa, my age is this, my gender is this, I just came from here, this is my language,

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:42.200
 English, all that, that's all hallucination. There's like a tiny little fraction of the

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:48.200
 full range of pattern that exists in the world, infinite worlds. This is just a tiny little speck

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:55.560
 of the full story. Tantra says it's a full story, it's inexhaustible. You're a Gurumache, you're

00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:59.640
 Vajrasapha, you're Tara, you're Vajrayogini, you're all these Buddhas and bodhisattvas, all these

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:05.320
 inter-nested mandalas. That's what we're using positive grasping in Tibetan Buddhism to fully

00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:13.400
 embrace, to allow, to relax into. We use this imagined form to totally include all these worlds,

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:19.400
 all these ways of being and knowing, that are the natural as our own natural intelligence.

00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:25.880
 Logic and beyond logic, science and beyond science, body and beyond body,

00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:32.280
 all this we're including so much in the Vajrayana view. But it's not just imagination,

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:38.680
 we use the positive grasping to recognize wisdom expression for the display of wisdom.

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:46.680
 That's Tantra. So we should be really careful with ourselves, definitely me too, as if these

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:51.240
 really highest teachings like Dzogchen and Mahamudra and Chud and Shije and all these

00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:56.280
 really lambda, these amazingly ninth yana are like kind of union of father, mother, Tantra

00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:56.760
 teachings,

00:32:56.760 --> 00:33:01.320
 nondual, neuter teachings, whatever you call them, the ninth yana, highest, inner, unexcelled,

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:07.640
 inner Tantras or whatever you call. We're not just saying it's emptiness like sky, like be here now

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:07.640
.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:16.440
 That's third yana, Zen. We have to include that, but we also have to include pure relative truth,

00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:24.040
 pure body, pure speech, that's called Tantra. All these vast worlds or civilizations of deity,

00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:30.540
 mantra, Dharmakaya, they're all included because reality includes them all. And so we use

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:31.080
 imagination

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:38.120
 to fully embrace them, the pure and the impure, the whole inexhaustible spectrum of impure,

00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:42.440
 all kinds of nightmares and good dreams and the inexhaustible spectrum of pure.

00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:47.080
 And none of it's fixed or frozen. There's no final foundation.

00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:54.520
 That's why in the end we avoid all the final big arguments on what's really real. There's no really

00:33:54.520 --> 00:34:03.160
 real. Closer you look, it opens up further. It keeps opening. There's no final bedrock reality.

00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:11.400
 Vajrasattva in the end isn't ultimately white. It'd be any color. It only depends on what's helpful

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:11.400
.

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:18.440
 And then once you locate that game, that world, that system of what's helpful for that mind,

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:22.840
 those minds, then Vajrasattva very all of a sudden coheres into a total world,

00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:30.680
 Amandala, that's very exact, very patterned, doesn't mix anything up. Relative truth is infallible.

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:38.840
 And then if that's not helpful anymore, it just phases into another world. And that's helpful then.

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:44.760
 It's always ever shifting because that's how actual living ecologies work. They're responsive,

00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:50.520
 always dynamically moving in relationship to what's helpful. So it's like Buddha natures

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:56.290
 of different beings are syncing up with each other. And this makes the practice of Tibetan Buddhism

00:34:56.290 --> 00:34:56.360
,

00:34:56.360 --> 00:35:01.160
 that's what they talk about as blissful or joyful. Because we're not having to create it.

00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:05.800
 It's already there. We're just having to relax and enjoy it. And I'm not saying I can do that.

00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:12.840
 I definitely hardly ever can do that. Maybe, maybe for two seconds, like five, whatever,

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:18.280
 15 years ago or something, really relax into that. But that's really what Vajrayana is pointing

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:18.520
 towards.

00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:26.040
 To just allow, oh, it's so enjoy, like the nature is here already, I have to create it and relax

00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:30.920
 into it and let it more fully come out and let it dissolve my fixations, my grasping.

00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:37.720
 And just really celebrate and enjoy, enjoy the beauty of others, enjoy the beauty of myself

00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:44.360
 courageously. And so this is not just me talking about things. We can really see this very clearly,

00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:50.120
 the three main points, like as a takeaway, three main points that always have to be there

00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:55.800
 in Vajrayana visualization practice or creation stage practice. Rimbiches has taught this many

00:35:55.800 --> 00:36:01.800
 times. Their Essential Journey of Life and Death, volume one. They taught, teach us very clearly.

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:06.920
 Essential Journey of Life and Death, volume one. Indestructible Nature of Body, Speech, and Mind,

00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:18.440
 that book. These three points, clarity, purity, stability, CPS. I think of it the computer

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:24.120
 processing system, but whatever. Sometimes acronyms are helpful to remember. CPS, clarity, purity,

00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:32.200
 stability. Clarity is this aspect of detail. One camera, Rimbiches says, clarity, we're trying to

00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:37.480
 really in a vivid detail be with the mandala that we're in, the sadhana, like the dudram tarsar

00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:42.680
 refuge tree. And it's a living reality all around us. It's not a picture we're looking at. It's the

00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:50.600
 world, but with a lot of detail, clarity. And the second way that he unpacks clarity is you really

00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:59.000
 feel like it's there. Guru Rimbiche really is here. So are the dakas and dakinis and arhats and

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:06.090
 bodhisattvas and all the dharma teachings, dharma palas and harukas. They're all really here. That

00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:06.520
's

00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:15.480
 clarity. You vividly feel it's really happening. That's an interesting belief there, but you're

00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:23.160
 not believing it. You really feel it. That's clarity, essential for Vajrayana practice.

00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:31.320
 The second purity, it's already like this. It's not pretend. These enlightened, the nature of

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:37.260
 reality, body, speech, and mind is pure, pure body, pure speech, pure mind, deity, mantra, dharmak

00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:37.640
aya.

00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:48.680
 It is this way. Pure relative truth, this purity. That's the second point. This mandala is really

00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:54.920
 here. I'm feeling it. And it really is this way. It's just all wisdom display, transcendental

00:37:54.920 --> 00:38:01.960
 wisdom rainbow body. And the third, stability. Stability is one related to shamatha or kind of

00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:06.360
 something as if we're holding like a samayasattva or kind of like an approach, like we're holding

00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:11.560
 or concentrating, we're staying calmly or something, calmly abiding in the mandala. So important.

00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:11.720
 We

00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:16.680
 pick a sadhana, we pick a system, we have instruction on it, and we stay in that mandala. We

00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:23.400
 actually learn to be shaped by that ecology. It opens us up. It opens our Buddha nature up.

00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:27.880
 And that one way, like as an approach, we're holding ourselves in that mandala.

00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:34.840
 So we're staying in the mandala. We're like trying to be with Guru Rinpoche in the due

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:40.760
 to our refuge tree with the activities of kind of emanating offerings and receiving blessings

00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:47.880
 and purification. And then then Guru Rinpoche mingles with us perfectly, completely.

00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:53.240
 So, but there is this orientation towards a jhana saffar, the wisdom being.

00:38:53.240 --> 00:39:00.760
 And that's part related to this, this stability. The second way of seeing stability is not just

00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:06.600
 being with in a sustained way, or as if it's just shamatha that's longer, staying calmly longer.

00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:16.440
 It's being with is actually Vajra pride. I am this way. I am Guru Rinpoche. Guru Rinpoche is here.

00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:21.240
 This wisdom is here. Love and compassion is the fabric of reality, just unflinchingly,

00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:30.200
 courageously, naturally relaxing into that stability. So we feel the presence of the mandala

00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:36.440
 with brightness, clarity. Gradually, the detail of the pattern is kind of clarified. Some days are

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:42.040
 clear. Some days are not clear. Whatever purity, transcendental wisdom, rainbow body, it's actually

00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:47.160
 pure relative truth, everything, not just what's in front of me or in this room, all of reality.

00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:59.480
 And Vajra pride, be with it confidently. This is true. This is true. It's called pure perception.

00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:04.840
 And this is such a relief. This is what Vajrayana is pointing towards in one way as surrender.

00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:11.720
 We actually let ourselves surrender to this living mandala system. It's already here.

00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:17.720
 It's already functioning. It already knows what to do. We just have to be with it. Surrender,

00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:23.400
 devotion, feel the close warm hearted connection to the living wisdom mandala.

00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:30.120
 All these lineage masters, they already recognize this is the way reality is. It's pure,

00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:37.000
 great equality and great purity in union. They recognize this. They're so joyful. They're so

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:42.040
 happy. We're exploring this ourselves using positive grasping or imagination to just actually

00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:47.380
 relax and rest. Oh, this, I didn't have to create this. This mandala was already here. This

00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:47.960
 infinite

00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:54.680
 internested mandalas of worlds of pure relative truth and absolute kind of inexhaustible

00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:55.400
 flexibility

00:40:55.400 --> 00:41:02.280
 already here. We just, it knows how to sync up with itself. It knows how to keep including more

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:07.880
 patterns, more worlds, more systems, more views. There's no limit. It has no preference game.

00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:13.000
 Let's just joyfully include more for the benefit of self and other happiness and long lasting

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.800
 happiness for all beings. So we don't have to like, it's not a job.

00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:29.400
 It's like, this is mandalas here. Totally pure. I'm a part of it. I'm enlightened. Mind this,

00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:34.280
 nature is enlightened. And then just enjoy the sadhana practice. And if we can do that for little

00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:39.640
 bits of time, little bit, little bit, it'll gradually extend. And they say it's just self,

00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:45.480
 it's auto poetic. So it's self kind of orient itself. It naturally no includes more. And it's

00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:52.600
 also self fulfilling. It naturally feels content. It's called this great blissfulness in union with

00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:59.160
 emptiness. It's naturally happy. It's already wisdom. It's already compassion. And then we

00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:05.480
 just relax and kind of enjoy that. And so there's already wisdom beings that have done that actual

00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:11.720
 beings that are still here in this room in your body in your awareness. They're not playing games,

00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:16.280
 they're not locked into any timeframe anymore. They're not locked into any space frame. They

00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:21.960
 flexibly move however is helpful. But they're actual beings that can do that. They're called

00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:28.200
 jhana sattvas, wisdom beings like actual Tara, not our imagination of Tara, but actual Tara,

00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:37.400
 actual Buddha actual Gurmuche. And then so that's like, way out of the box of what most people are

00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:42.760
 willing to consider. One, the fabric of reality is actually enlightened. Two, there's actually

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:49.000
 wisdom beings in this reality we share now that are doing enlightened activity right now.

00:42:51.560 --> 00:43:00.280
 In this very room, we're in, in every part of our perception. How amazing. It's so wonderfully kind

00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:05.580
 of vast and big. It's a bold, courageous view. And if we have this view, then things like, you know

00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:05.640
,

00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:14.520
 AI becoming sentient, maybe, or like, definitely, it's already smaller than humans. 150 IQ. Most

00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:19.240
 humans have 110. They already beat us in the computational game, things like that. It's like,

00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:23.640
 what's going to happen? The Buddha already taught there's so many other beings like this. There's

00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:29.960
 so many gods and formless gods and so many way beyond normal human propositional knowledge.

00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:35.880
 They're talking about time eons of time scales, vast world systems that they are, they can be

00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:40.600
 in touch with. We have one little piece of one little part of our very human fixated kind of

00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:47.720
 experience. But already taught, this is so vast. If we more courageously take this vajrayana views,

00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:53.240
 then we won't kind of like react so with such shock and terror. We won't be so triggered.

00:43:53.240 --> 00:44:00.120
 We won't be so shut down. When these new things happening, when all the stuff, everything swirling

00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:06.440
 in ways that are very like, what is this? I say, well, actually relax and be like, oh,

00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:12.280
 this is one way it can happen too. But what's really happening is pure relative truth. And

00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:17.080
 then can include this nightmare or this beautiful thing. And so we'll, we'll develop that kind of

00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:22.840
 courage as well. But that courage of what is Appa and that courage of a great fearless

00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:27.800
 wisdom being like a, a, these accomplished vajrayana masters have shown us this way,

00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:34.680
 this courage. And then how will we show up in life? So humbly, so delicately,

00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:38.680
 such precision will show up what's helpful for others.

00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:42.680
 We can see that in our great teacher.

00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:48.360
 Kenshin, Paul, and Cherub, Rinpoche, his Holiness, his Holiness, Duja Rinpoche,

00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:58.120
 all these so many masters boundless wisdom, such detailed, juicy, just like heart beating,

00:44:58.120 --> 00:45:07.480
 like saturated, really cozy, just glowing bodhicitta kindness all the time. And they're,

00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:16.040
 we're following in their footsteps now. And may we always directly connect to these extraordinary

00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:20.040
 wisdom beings follow in their footsteps, learn to give up the negative grasping,

00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:28.360
 reveal like the wisdom grasping by using positive grasping or belief, accessing the power of belief

00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:28.360
.

00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:35.000
 So we can really recognize the wisdom outside wisdom inside wisdom in its natural union with

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:40.520
 compassion all the time as living wisdom and dala filled with living wisdom beings right now,

00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:45.560
 this very moment. Thank you friends.

00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:56.520
 Thank you. Thank you. Great. So now we get to do Dijam Terasarnandro practice.

00:45:56.520 --> 00:46:02.840
 We'll just have a brief kind of like silent meditation, kind of refresh it all. And then

00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:09.240
 we'll go to the Dijam Terasarnandro revealed by His Holiness, Duja Rinpoche. I think we'll start,

00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:15.000
 I think it's page 18 and most versions with the prayer of calling the Lama from afar a mind term

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:23.560
 of His Holiness, Duja Rinpoche. Page 18, spontaneous song of the original nature. Great. Thank you.

00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:42.840
 Thank you.
