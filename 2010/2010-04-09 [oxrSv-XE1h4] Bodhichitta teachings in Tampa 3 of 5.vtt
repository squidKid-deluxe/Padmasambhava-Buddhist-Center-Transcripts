00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 And again, we develop this bodhichitta, as we said, and then there is an honor. First is wishing

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 bodhichitta and that is more of a practical level, how we kind of develop this bodhichitta.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.670
 First, we wishing bodhichitta. That means, first bodhichitta is not coming from outside because it

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:25.000
 has to develop from our heart, from our mind, mind, from our intention.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.110
 And so starting, kind of, first sizzling into your one's own heart. I like to help other beings. I

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:38.000
 like to benefit to other beings. I like to do kindness activities to others.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.790
 Kind of something that really sizzling and activating in one's own mind, very genuine, very

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.000
 beautifully developing.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.690
 And I like to also practice and remove my obstacles in order to benefit to all beings. Kind of

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:02.000
 think, what do you call this, think locally, act globally. That's it.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.960
 So now, first I'm going to remove my obstacles, in order to do that, I'm going to meditate. I'm

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.450
 going to practice and do these things. And that will really help me so that I can help to the

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.000
 others.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:21.270
 Trying to well accommodate ourselves for that. This is not that sincerely attitude thought. And

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.000
 that is known as the wishing bodhichitta and the intention bodhichitta.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 So once we have that thought, then we begin to activate bodhichitta.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.460
 This wishing bodhichitta, again, of course, the reason you already know, I mean, it's not something

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.000
 that, no doubt.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 This wishing bodhichitta, I like to help other beings. It's very, very important. I mean, you know,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.950
 all the beings of sentient beings, or the sentient beings, or all the other beings, everyone is

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.000
 struggling.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.880
 Everyone is struggling their own status, own space. In the ancient time, it said kings are

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:08.000
 struggling on the throne, or kings are struggling on the kingdom.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.700
 Ministers are struggling in the ministers' positions. Four purposes are struggling in the four

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.930
 states, and the rich purpose is struggling in the rich states, and the beggars are struggling in

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.000
 the beggar states.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.270
 That is just a kind of work. Then each other, everyone has some trouble. Something, even they look

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:34.000
 like so good, still there's something really going on, on and the difficulties.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.940
 This, everyone has trouble. This is just human levels. And then all the different realms in

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.000
 thinking, there's so many difficulties, troubles.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.460
 Then we all have the majority that inevitably, inevitably there is four difficulties, and those are

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:58.000
 known as the birth, getting old, the sicknesses, and the death.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:06.520
 And those are all difficult transitions. Even maybe birth, we kind of celebrate, celebrate, but

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:16.040
 birth is big transitions. Both mother level, and as well as child, the new baby level, it is big

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.000
 challenges.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:27.870
 And once after that kind of transition passed, then next is getting old, and the sickness, and the

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.000
 death.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:36.040
 And that, I mean, each level we start thinking of these three, getting old, and the sickness, and

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:47.000
 the death, is a tremendous burden, tremendous challenge, and difficult for each individual.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.940
 And then as well as those who are connected. It's so much. Those are just the majority, that

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:59.920
 baggage comes. But then beside that, I said, kids struggling in the capital, and everyone, I mean,

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:05.480
 every level, there's rich people suffering in the rich places, poor people suffering in the poor

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.000
 places.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:17.700
 Everyone, because there is so many unsatisfied things, always happen. And this is due to the

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:25.000
 ignorance, attachment, anger, all self-important, and that's all happening.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:32.460
 So therefore, this bodhicitta, again, that level is so important to helping to all beings. To kind

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.930
 of think of every living beings, I'm going to help, think, kind of sincerely thinking, that is

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.000
 known as wishing bodhicitta.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.430
 And in order to do that, I think many of you know this, but also, bodhicitta, if you would like to

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:52.400
 do pray, that bodhicitta, pray itself, wishing bodhicitta is the essence of that wishing bodhicitta

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.000
 is known as this one.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 This yellow Bhagat has that. For example, may all beings have the happiness and cause of happiness.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 This is known as the prayer of the bond of love, love and kindness.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.130
 And then may all, may they be free from suffering and cause of sufferings. This is boneless,

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:22.450
 compassionate prayers. And then may there never be this aspect from the supreme happiness which is

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.000
 without sufferings.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:35.060
 This is then rejoice and joy, practice. Joy, joy, this can be translated, rejoice, joy, graceful,

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:40.000
 and gratitude, gratitude, that prayers.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:47.670
 And then may they remain in the boneless equanimity, free from both attachment to the close ones

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:56.000
 and rejection of others. This is the prayer of boneless equanimity, all living beings.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:05.100
 So this is, again, this alone is so special practices, so special practices, prayers. Like when you

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:13.060
 have time and that you can really chime these prayers and reflect this meaning sincerely in the

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:18.000
 heart and the waking, what you chime to, it is special power.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.440
 There's so many stories. I'm not going to talk and maybe you already know that. But one good, even

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:31.770
 a small benefit of thought brought so many results, so many benefits, many levels, external level,

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.000
 internal level. There's so many stories.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:41.060
 So that merely, if we shouldn't think, merely praise what that will talk. But when we know our

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:48.410
 powerful mind, when activated and kind of like when we release that energy to this space of dharmad

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:55.000
atta or the nature, it goes far beyond than we can imagine by the conceptions.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:01.210
 It really does. It's a very, so many days stories and so many beautiful results that mentioned in

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:06.000
 the Buddha's teaching as well as teachings of other greatest masters.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:13.870
 So therefore, wishing this prayer sincerely to the others and thinking with all beings is so

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:23.000
 special. And this is the essence of the wishing bodhic, the prayers.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:32.460
 And then again, when we do this, once we develop the wishing bodhic cata, then second is known as

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:37.000
 then actualizing bodhic cata or engaging bodhic cata.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:45.620
 And actualizing, engaging bodhic cata is then as you have the intention taught sincerely, now that

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:54.000
 intention is begin to reflect by verbally or by physically, physically and begin to reflect.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:00.940
 And how going to reflect that and then reflected through the conflicts of the six parametas or amya

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:09.000
 six parametas and reflecting the bodhic cata activity from the generalist practices.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:17.520
 And then reflecting the bodhic cata from the moralities, the conduct levels and then reflecting the

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:26.000
 bodhic cata through the patient or the tolerance, tolerance level, patient, tolerance levels.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:32.980
 And then reflecting the bodhic cata all the time with joyful efforts and reflecting the bodhic cata

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:36.000
 through the concentration meditations.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 Reflecting the bodhic cata through then western power, transcendental practice.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 So reflecting the bodhic cata with those according your capabilities.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 And this is again capabilities. This is something to do with, for example, generosity practices.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:06.420
 Generosity practices when you are reflecting bodhic cata, when you do generosity practices, we

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:07.000
 should follow according our capabilities, according our range that what we can do.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.700
 We don't have to go far beyond the capabilities. Maybe once in a while you maybe can do, but

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:16.000
 shouldn't do too many times.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:23.330
 We have the long last goal, the goal that going to get ourselves enlightenment benefited for all

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:24.000
 beings.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.580
 (upbeat music)
