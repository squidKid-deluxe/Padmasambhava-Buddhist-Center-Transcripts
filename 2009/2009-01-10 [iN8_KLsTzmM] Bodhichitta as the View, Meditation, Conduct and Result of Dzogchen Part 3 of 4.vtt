 The question is, how do you feel about the Dzogchen tradition?

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 He practiced the bodhicata alone for seven years.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 Seven years, because of that, then his realization is burst, he said.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 Even not just only that, he said, because of the power of his practice on the bodhicata,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 his teaching, what he shared in the lineage message,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.660
 he said, it will rapidly spread out, as burst, because of the power of the bodhicata that he

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.000
 mentioned.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 That is true, what he said, his teachings completely went as a kind of grass fire,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 fire and went every direction of the Tibetan corner,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 and went out of the border of the Tibetan countries.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.940
 And all that is now one of the most renowned, powerful teachings of the Niungma schools, the Niung

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.000
taic becomes.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 Because he predicted that, again, he said he practiced on the bodhicata.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 So bodhicata is so important, when we have the bodhicata,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:20.640
 bodhicata is warm, warm, calm, and it is like, it's moisture, it's like rain, showers in the spring

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:21.000
time.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 When you have that, then all the lushness, greenness will come easily and beautifully,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 and grow so perfectly as this.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.660
 This is what the bodhicata, we do the bodhicata, and then it's going to become dark and cold and

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:35.000
 empty,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 almost like a desert, and just won't grow too much.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 And therefore, all those great experienced masters and everyone connected,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
 these cooperatives that took the blend in without any distinction,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 because nature is united, there's no difference.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000
 Only duality mind is leaning different ways, where to kind of our habit pattern,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 we kind of accept and kind of falls in extreme state.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 Nature is a union, complete and inseparable state, as it is.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 All those great practitioners bring up the body together,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 according to the capability, according to the situation,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 and then the realization is bursted.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 And then Dzogchen is the most powerful teaching.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
 It makes everything perfectly and beautiful.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 And so those are very important to think, and this is the part of the foundation,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 and also the central column or the structures of the practice itself.
