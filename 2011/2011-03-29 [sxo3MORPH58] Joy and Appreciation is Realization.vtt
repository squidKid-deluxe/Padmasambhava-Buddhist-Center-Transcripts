NOTE }

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.240
 Joy and appreciation is important. Without joy and appreciation, our practice won't go so well.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:16.730
 Because even we have the nugget teaching of Dzogchen Muhammad, without appreciation and devotion,

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.660
 our practice becomes almost dry.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:32.660
 Dry, there is no moisture. It's dry. It's like when we drop this seed in the desert, it won't grow.

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.600
 It will dry up there.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:44.540
 But with that seed, we drop it in some nice field, soil places, or the farmland, the way there is

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.040
 moisture,

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:52.400
 where there is beautiful conditions, then definitely it will break growth.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:01:00.660
 Similarly, joy and devotion are like fertilizer to grow. We should feel joy.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.600
 Joy and appreciation and devotion are really important all the time.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:12.070
 Teaching said, I'm sure, it's going to turn more and get better. But we should, every practitioner,

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.760
 we begin to the joy and devotion and the raffle and the bodhicapal.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:24.100
 Those all have bought it. And again, to summarize that joy and devotion, devotion, raffle is what?

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.300
 Essence of raffle is confidence.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:33.770
 Confidence in the Buddha, dharma and sahaja. And both each other is love and compassion, kindness

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.200
 and thought, kind hearted.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:44.060
 Joyful hearted, compassion and hearted, and appreciation and hearted.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:51.060
 And we have those beautiful qualities. Our practice will become as piece of cake.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.760
 It's not difficult. Boring, practice, dragging practice. And looking, "Oh, again I have to do

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.920
 practice. Oh, I have to do this. Oh, I need to do this."

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:09.580
 This comes dragging, but we may be lacking. But this means lacking joy and devotion, and both each

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.160
 other, or confidence and love.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.300
 We have all those beautiful qualities. Then really, it all comes so perfectly. So therefore, in

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:25.260
 here, at the beginning here, it's only said, "I bow down, respect and take refuge."

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.650
 That means also, "I trust, trust and confidence with confidence in joy." Also, sometimes in India,

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:42.260
 they use, this is what they call, "surrender." I think. Surrender is also all very nice. Surrender.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:57.450
 We are not going to resist with our ego clakings. We are not going to give the power to the ego,

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.260
 ego, and happy path.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:07.260
 We are going to give power to the Buddha, to the Dharma, to the Sangha, to the practice. Practice.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:14.980
 I'm not going to resist it. So what they call surrender. Surrender. Surrender. Surrender. It's good

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.260
. Surrender.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:24.770
 When it's surrender, that means it's not something we are losing. What is losing? What is a little

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.260
 bit dimming down?

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:36.020
 Don't we know it's ego clinking? Ego. Ego and arrogance. Ego and arrogance. And I like to be in

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.260
 this way, my way, my way, my style.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:47.260
 "Oh, you don't fit with me. I don't like that." These kind of things we can do, of course, too.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:54.030
 But when we come to the practice, if we start doing this many times, what we become, we are losing

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.260
 our ground of the practice.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:05.260
 Our Dharma ground is really losing. Therefore, that means who is winning? Ego clinking, happy path.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:12.180
 Happy path, not good happy path, there's two things at the beginning time. Happy path of the

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.260
 attachment, grasping, clinking,

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:26.440
 all those negative emotions, winning, they keep in the upper hand. So therefore, to do this,

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.260
 respect, appreciation,

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:39.260
 trusting. Trusting this all is very important. In fit of the glories, supreme good.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:46.260
 Fit of the glories, it doesn't mean you can also fit. It means you're going to touch to the fit.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:52.560
 Of course, traditionally, ancient time, when they were born to the teacher or to the shrine, they

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.260
 go to touch to the lowest part of the shrine.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:02.260
 They're not just jumping up to the head of the Buddha, but to put to their head too.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:13.560
 So that means the highest step of our body is touching to the lowest part of the lower spot and

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.260
 therefore putting to the feet, that too.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:26.100
 But also it means, fit means no arrogance, less arrogance in our mind, kind of deep reverence and

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.260
 practice, we practice, touching.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:32.260
 And then, traditionally, books, I mean in India, I'm showing you those who've been in India,

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:37.260
 they every time, many times when they respect, everybody touch to their feet by endings.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:44.260
 They don't even cover the younger ones, the younger ones touch to the elders' feet.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:50.260
 Feet, that means I respect their knowledge, they experience their guidance, respect.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:59.100
 And that's how the lineage or the tradition fast and keeping a very rich culture and keep that

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.260
 respect, appreciate.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:08.140
 You learn because that's arrogance. And arrogance is the obstacle, arrogance always on the teaching

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:08.260
.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:13.360
 Teaching says, it's not just the teaching, we can feel that too, I mean, because that's what the

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.260
 teaching says.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:20.600
 Arrogance is like an iron ball, iron ball, no matter how much water we boil, won't catch water like

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.260
 this.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:28.260
 And then similarly, when we have the arrogance, no matter how much knowledge you gain from others,

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:29.260
 it won't sink.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:37.770
 It just spells out, out, it won't absorb. So therefore, this respect here, for example, bow down to

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:40.260
 the lord's feet.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
 Take that, I take leverage.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:53.780
 And then here it says, I, my followers, and I be blessed so that the realization of the profound

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:57.260
 part, they born cooking, cooking.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:04.460
 This, what that actually means, of course we all know, realization may be something, zogchi,

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:05.260
 realization, that we are thinking.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:09.260
 It's true, zogchi, realization is realization.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:17.770
 But realization is something we have to think more practically, more tangible way, more what we can

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:20.260
 handle, realization.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:27.260
 That realization, this realization, zogchi, realization, start with what we've been discussing.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:35.260
 Yoga, devotion, bodhicata, those are realization.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
 These are realization.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:44.260
 When we have those realization in heart, zogchi, realization comes so easily.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:53.260
 Mahamud realization comes so easily. For that reason, for that reason, in the teaching said, in the

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:54.260
 great Master Saraha said,

00:07:54.260 --> 00:08:00.260
 and as the author, great master K.T. Baddishya, he wrote ten quotations.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:09.700
 He said, realization comes by accumulating the merit and blessing by the, from the teacher, that

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:11.260
 says.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:16.850
 And that blessing from the teacher, accumulating the merit, what that means, we've all been

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:17.260
 discussing,

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:21.260
 because blessing from the teacher comes with devotions.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:26.260
 When we have to devote, joy and appreciation, accumulating the merit.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.260
 Merit is both each other, six part of the method.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:33.260
 Accumulation merit, accumulation merit, that's true, right?

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:38.260
 We all, most of you, the worst of merit and accumulation merit.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.260
 Both merit have to be targeted.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:45.260
 So those all come targeted, then realization comes.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:50.260
 So that means, for the person, most of us, what is realization?

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:59.260
 Joy, devotion, bodhicata, confidence, patience.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:08.260
 And we have those, that is now, our soil is activated, spring is coming.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:12.260
 Definitely the growth will come, realization will come.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:18.900
 This joy and devotion, bodhicata, confidence, all that's in the spring, spring energy of the

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:20.260
 realization.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.260
 This is the one, that is realization.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:29.260
 Joy and devotion, bodhicata, generation is a genre of realization.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
 They are realization.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:35.260
 This will lead to full bloom of the realization.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:40.260
 So therefore, we pray, when we join, meditate, this one, we pray.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.260
 May I have the joy.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.260
 May my joy burn in my heart.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:51.260
 May the loving kindness, compassion burn in my heart.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.260
 My devotion burn in the heart.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:59.260
 The confidence, trust burn in my heart.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:03.260
 That is profound realization.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
 What means, perform here?

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.260
 Here also, pause here.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.260
 Perform.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
 Perform.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:17.260
 Perform means, love is evident.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.260
 Joy is evident.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.260
 Devotion is evident.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.260
 That we have to bring.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:32.260
 Present our joy in the devotion, bodhicata, I'm not saying all of you, but maybe a few of us.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.260
 Our devotion is maybe shallow.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
 Joy is shallow.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.260
 Loving kindness and compassion may be shallow.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
 It's not profound enough.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:48.260
 We didn't touch yet the deep of our nature, yet we have to act with it.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:52.260
 When we touch that deep, that is path.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
 That is the truly path.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:11:02.260
 We are moving forward inwardly, inwardly, and we are deepening our practices, our meditation.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.260
 All that begins really comes, so nice.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:09.260
 So this realization comes quickly in a sense.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:14.260
 When that comes, then the zogchi realization, what we're talking all the time.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:19.260
 The Muhammad realization, what we're talking all, looking forward, is just there.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
 It's not far away.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:22.260
 Far away.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:29.200
 It becomes so surprising, and that it becomes so surprising, so beautiful, so unexpected many times

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.260
 it comes.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:35.260
 And then we read the life story of those great masters who got those realizations.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:42.240
 When long process, kind of long process, difficulty, looks like difficulty, but their courage and

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.260
 commitment,

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:53.260
 the immense of their joy and devotion, unyielding, unflailing.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:59.480
 The devotion continues to keep up that, with that, and then surprisingly the realization comes so

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:00.260
 instantly.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:06.280
 With this simple technique, simple method, even don't really need anything that looks like just so

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:07.260
 ridiculously.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.260
 They got the realization, how that can be that kind.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:19.260
 That happened, because of this, what they're deepening, joy, devotion, bodhicata, competence.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:27.260
 That's what they're deepening, and then they burst their realization and become as like sky yogi.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:32.860
 And those, that merge to the Buddha, Sangha, the Buddha, all the Buddha, Shatamuni, Gaurupayama,

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:34.260
 Sangha.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:43.460
 All that, just the long lasting looking, longing of their realization, what that just happened, in

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:45.260
 just that instant.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:54.630
 That all depended, all started with this Bhutani journey of joy, devotion, bodhicata, and

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:58.260
 confidence, and their commitment.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:04.260
 This is, you read the books that so many thousands now, you read that.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:14.260
 Then they become totally fearless, totally enlightened, yet so simple and so beautiful.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
 And that is the one who comes.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:25.260
 So therefore, when we start with this, this, then the big realization of the profound father,

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:32.260
 then quickly realization comes, with all the slight arrow, slight arrow.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:37.260
 This slight arrow means then no arrows, no mistakes.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:40.260
 That started with the realization, no mistake.

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:46.260
 There's many times, teacher, papa said, "Oh, I've got so many realizations."

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.260
 "I've heard that so many times," Prabhupada said.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:54.260
 "I've got so many realizations, but I don't know what is this."

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
 He really said that.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:14:01.260
 "I've got so many realizations, but I don't know."

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.260
 That must be where I was called.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:10.260
 "Skeptical realization" and "dartful realization."

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:17.260
 "Dartful realization" and "skeptical realization," also, "I don't know what is that."

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.260
 You mean, they don't know, and I don't know.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.260
 I mean, it's true, I don't know. It's really that.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:32.260
 But true realization comes, no need doubt, no need "skeptical."

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:39.260
 This brilliant sun, arising in the sky, free from clouds, free from the mists,

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:43.260
 or these dusters, or pollutions, it's just a brilliant.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:48.260
 You feel happy, you feel confidence, and you feel glorious.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:54.260
 And yet, you feel so gentle and peaceful, love and kindness.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:59.260
 And as the Buddha Shakyamuni, as the Gurbia Masambhava,

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:06.260
 as those great monsters that we did and we saw, that's what it is, the realization.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:11.260
 And to start with that, to have that un-dartful realization,

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:20.260
 un-skeptical realization, un-error realization, then start with joy,

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:27.260
 devotion, both each other, then we move forward with that.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.260
 That is just a way to do it.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:33.260
 We don't have to be skeptical with joy.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:37.260
 We don't have to be skeptical with the devotions.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:42.260
 We don't have to be skeptical with love and kindness and compassion.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:43.260
 We don't have to.

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:47.260
 As they are building, it's true, it's so special, it's beautiful.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:51.260
 And that same way, realization will break.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.260
 Realization will become so beautiful and so special.

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.260
 That's what he said.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:01.260
 So this, you see, you don't say sustainability, and this and that.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:06.260
 So then we'll go this, then what? Don't chitat. Don't chitat.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:09.260
 Chitat dalat ditas, that's the way to say it.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:12.260
 And it's a way to say zen sasih.

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:18.260
 Zen sasih means like portals.

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:22.260
 Portals that have now, like portals.

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:23.260
 Portals.

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:24.260
 Portals.

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:27.260
 Portals that have no fears.

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:30.260
 You don't have to be scared with this.

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.260
 No fears.

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.260
 No fears to anything.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.260
 No, you don't have to be happy with something.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:38.260
 No hope.

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:39.260
 No fears.

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.260
 Or no expectations.

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.260
 No loneliness.

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:44.260
 No game.

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:45.260
 You got everything.

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:48.260
 And therefore, in the zoki chitin,

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:51.260
 I'm sure we have been hit from kijipartasya namuchi,

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:54.260
 and as well as, when I said this, poor confidence.

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:57.260
 Poor fellas and stits.

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.260
 When you got high, it's the realization.

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.260
 When you reach the zoki status.

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:05.260
 And the chitin said, when you reach that realization status,

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:10.260
 even you see the millions of Buddhas right in front of you,

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:13.260
 there's nothing more to ask.

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:16.260
 Nothing more to resume.

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:19.260
 You got everything.

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:21.260
 You got this revolt.

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:26.260
 Even your sorrow with millions of the enemies,

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:29.260
 there's nothing to fear.

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.260
 There's nothing to fear.

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:33.260
 That is like chitada, chitada.

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:37.260
 There's poor, poor performance to achieve this.

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:42.260
 This is then, you discover our old inner nature,

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:49.260
 naked, fresh, without any cover-up.

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:53.260
 That is then said by the blessings.
