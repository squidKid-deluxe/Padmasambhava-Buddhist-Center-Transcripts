00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 Thank you everyone again. Thank you very much for the participation I've succeeded many times.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 Thank you.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.640
 Thank you everyone. Again, now we are going to continue to concluding these teachings of the great

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.000
 master Mahabharata.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.670
 And again, for those reasons, please activate your virtual motivations of the yoga and the

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.000
 appreciation you've been grateful for.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 And then vastness of motivation of the bodhicata and as well as purity realization of the practice

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 or the understanding of the radhiana teaching of the three various stages.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 And now, with those beautiful intentions, we go to the teaching itself.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 And that is, now we are in the Ved 16th, according to that or whatever form you have. It's 16th.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.260
 Now, in the 16th and the second line of this first page, here is the samsara, it's mainly construct

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.000
ions.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:20.190
 When you are free from the concertion, that is the great westerns. So that is what teaching is

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.000
 saying, that samsara is mainly constructions.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.180
 This is generally the Buddha teaching, where this samsara came from, the samsara, the jhagintra, s

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.000
amsara, where did it come from?

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:44.990
 It's all emanated, all merged from our mind, due to the mistake and unknowing situation of the true

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.000
 nature.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:55.400
 Where it started, from the ordinary natural state of the great emptiness of the rupa, great

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.000
 emptiness of the rupa, Dharmakaya rupa, is pervasive.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 It's pervasive. Freedom and no partialities. Free from the partialities, discriminations.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 And openness from that energy of the rupa, express the energy of the rupa, we sentient beings,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 react it at very beginning time.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:36.640
 And that is the beginning of the dualities. Then we deluded the whole things, whole our display of

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.000
 the energy we deluded.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 And because we hold as a subject and object in a carried way, carried way.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:55.070
 Otherwise, it's all from pure, puristic, it started. Emptiness. Emptiness of the rupa, if I use the

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.000
 word emptiness of the rupa.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 And how it came, came as a delusion, is not solid existence.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 Who is going through that? We all beings are going through. All the beings with six veins are going

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 through this challenge.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 There is no end, because we are propagating, continuing one after another. As cocoon created its

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 own trap, cocoon's own trap, and trapped it.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:46.290
 Our one's own creation is completely, we are trapped it, with the hope and fears and all the

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.000
 emotions.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 These emotions are the energy, display of the duality, or ego clinging.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:05.030
 Ego-cling is nothing but duality. It's grasping, clinging. There's nothing substantial, existing,

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.000
 independently existing ego-cling at all.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 It's merely conception, ideal. We are holding on to that.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 That is samsara. How long it is going to run? Endless. It's going to run endless.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 Then there's no end. Is there any, if we reverse that? Of each of ourselves.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 It's one's own creation, we have to reverse that direction. We have to reverse that direction.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:50.120
 How that? That's the gracious teacher, Buddha Hya Kya Muni said in the teaching, part truth, part

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.000
 truth, part truth.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 Then the cessation of truth comes as samsara completed.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:10.860
 So here, great master Muharrammajr is merely conception. Milly, that means it's not really solid.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:11.000
 It's merely.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:18.900
 Why is it not solid? Because mind or the concept is not solid. We discussed that earlier, and you

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.000
 know that.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 Consumption is empty. Not just empty once in a while, but that moment is empty.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 That's what we discuss in the Dzogki teaching. Moment is arising, that moment is empty.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:45.740
 Where that happening, and empty in the space of the rupa, where it's merging back, emptiness of the

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.000
 rupa status.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 Or it comes from Dharmakaya, it's hovering or the display happening in the Dharmakaya state of rupa

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
, it's merging back to the Dharmakaya status.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 But we were there, we trusted by our dualities. We grasp and cling, hold it. That is Kri Samsara.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:15.980
 For those reasons, what's in the teaching said, Buddha teaching, Tantra teaching said that this

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:22.000
 conception is the great ignorance.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 This is leading us and completely pushing down us in the samsara.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 It is the primary cause or the very cause of the samsaras.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.390
 And Gurbi and Masambhava are teaching, so I'm everywhere. It's not just saying, "I'm through this,

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:44.000
 what I'm talking about."

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 They're just saying that. And Gurbi and Masambhava were said.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:59.000
 The biggest demon is the conception, the biggest demon that will disturb us, now and forever.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 Not just one time, two times, the biggest demon, obstructor, hindrance, troublemaker.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:19.600
 Pay in the net, constantly, or pay wherever you can say. It's constantly. It is really a conception

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.000
.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:29.570
 So therefore, what Gurbi and Masambhava said, "I should take out this or now I should take out this

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:31.000
 conception

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 by the wrathful evilness of the emptiness of Rapa. Take out."

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 That's the reason. This is what the teaching is. This is what it is.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 So therefore, now Zoki is the most powerful practice that cuts directly to this conception.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:01.000
 And then we practice, continue with this, then we will become the free of the conceptions.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 Out of conceptions, we are looped of the samsara is ended.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 We are destroying, undermining, softening.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 For those reasons, great Masambhava said that thinking of emptiness in a short time, it matches.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 It makes it like softening or like losing up the dualities.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 Really, think of it in a short time.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:47.000
 How powerful? Because the emptiness realization is directly opposite of grasping and clinging.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
 The antidote is directly opposite.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 Therefore, merely thinking, it will make, what is his teaching says, it will make the spark.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 The spark, Rupu. Rupu means it really will make power. Power is so strong.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 Then it's kind of strong, powerful, strong.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 But when it becomes like rotten or something, then it becomes soft. It's just no strength.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:24.000
 So it will make this samsara, the thinking of the emptiness in a short time,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:35.000
 well, peeling away the samsara maybe. Rupu in a debate world, I can't translate it exactly.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 But it makes it rotten. When power is rotten or something, then it really makes it not like this.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 It just becomes soft. It just breaks away easily. That's what the teaching says.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 So that is it. So now, when the conception is free from the conception, what will happen?

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:08.000
 Then he has said, the great mattham of Rupu said, the wisdom, the great wisdom shines.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 As much as we create the conception, so after that, as we practice the meditate,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:21.000
 that much, the conception, grasping is going down, suffering, suffering.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:29.000
 At the same time, the inborn, inherited wisdom is growing, growing, expanding.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:35.000
 It's not growing that we cannot exist. We're rewirling, rewirling more wisdom.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 Then all the five wisdom will shine. When you complete the purify, the liberated,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 you are the consultant to the Dharmakaya, Rupa's status,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:54.000
 and then full bloom of the sunshine of the wisdom arises. That's what he said.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 And when you have that realization, even here, the great mattham of Rupu said,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000
 that is the great wisdom. Whoever has this realization,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 whoever has the realization of the emptiness of the wisdom,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 that moment, we're getting closer and closer to the Buddhahood, enlightenment.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 We're getting closer and closer to the Buddhahood

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 and well-read enlightenment in these lifetimes.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:30.000
 In these lifetimes, we're going to say goodbye to samsara, samsara,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:38.000
 and we ask the scour as enlightened status, enlightened status.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 And then, the next one, at the end, mindfulness also disappeared in this own natural space.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000
 That means here, at the end, what that indicates generally,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 when we receive the dokti teaching, that is not enough.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 Resuming the dokti teaching is not enough. Resuming the dokti teaching is great.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 It's awesome. It's marvelous. It's unique. It's so great.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000
 But that will be enough for us. Resuming that? No.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.000
 This end here indicates we have to put that in action.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 The teaching you received, knowledge you got,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 Glam's understanding of the Rupa, we, in each of us, have to put that in action.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 That is known as joyful effort to the practices.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
 We have to put that in action.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
 Without putting that in action, the full blown realization

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
 of what is mentioned here won't come easy.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 I'm sure you experienced it. You received the teaching a long time ago, maybe.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 But how much we may progress? You can ask our own self.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 Have you met very great progress? Wonderful. Thankful. Really. So great.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000
 That is not just I'm saying the great. All the Buddhas and bodhisattvas,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:18.000
 enlightened beings, lineage masters, are clubbing the hinge of your growth.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 That means those who have got good realization,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
 they become the shining stars of the galaxy of the samsaras.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
 You're going to illuminate it some degree and dispel the darkness

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 of all these illusions. Wonderful.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 But if somehow we didn't got any big progress, why?

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 Because we didn't put that into practices, with joyful effort,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 with devotions, with bodhisattvas.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 And maybe we just only thought, "Oh, Dzogchen is a big teaching.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 With teaching, it is so special. I don't have to do anything."

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 And we think that way, we are pulling our self, or deceiving our self.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 We have to practice. Look to the Dungchima. He practiced and meditated

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 so many years. Read the life story of Garab Dorni,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 even his emanation of the Vedasattvas.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 According to the teachings of the life story, Garab Dorni meditated.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
 Many Shirdi met her and meditated in practices.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
 He put those on the practices, as Dzogchen said.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 He said, "All the lineage masters who lie as a golden king,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 one after another, they are great practitioners."

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
 They really are great practitioners.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 That's why they bear their true nature, actualization.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 And all those 25 disciples from the Gopi and Masambhava,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
 because 25 great Gopi and Masambhava,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000
 did not come and bone like that great Shirdas,

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
 or great yogis, the yogi-ness of them.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 They did not bone.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 As received teaching from the great master from the Gopi and Masambhava,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
 the Shirdi, Rachata, and Brahmanamataram,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 they put that in action.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
 And they got the teaching.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 I mean, this view, we all know that.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 So therefore, here, it indicates great masters, more than what you said.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
 At the end, we put that in practice,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000
 continuing that joyful effort to the Dharma,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 not just one day, two days, short time,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 continually keeping with courage and commitment,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
 devotion in both each other.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 And then we really will reach.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
 Then the point will come, here, see?

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
 Then you see with the own mindfulness.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 So that means we are getting closer, closer,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
 that even though we don't need any effort to do practices,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
 particularly effort, joyful effort, that practice,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
 because your will of the spanning of the power of energy

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 is continually spanning.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
 Spinning because of your maturity,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 your energy, your motivation, now it's spinning.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000
 It's accelerating by itself.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000
 Self.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
 And what the great master Chaturkati in the teaching mentioned there,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
 with them in a pottery well,

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
 I mean, the ancient time, they went pottery.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 I mean, now too.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
 The pottery, they have will,

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000
 the potwork, the clay pot will be making well.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 At the beginning time, the potmaker will turn that with the head

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
 or method, that.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
 But once that reach to the cruise level or the level,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 the potmaker don't have to turn all the time.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:01.000
 It's spinning by itself, and you make the pots, clay pots.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
 Use that example.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
 It's spinning by itself.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 Because of all the ego-clingers,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 distractions of the negativeities are kind of going away.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 The self purity, clarity, wisdom is shining.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 And therefore, even the mindfulness, that effort,

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
 that thought, consumption is disabled.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
 And then here, that happened here.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
 That happened the next month.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.000
 And therefore, there is no more boundaries between mindfulness and wholeness.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 Then you can know him, he's already mentioned here.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
 And then day and night, the continually maintained,

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 and free from the effort, immovable, abiding in the sky.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
 Even you're not putting any effort, in nothing particular,

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 that you really become strong.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
 You are in the meditative status.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
 Meditative means what?

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 Actually, natural status.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 We are in the Rupa status, whether we recognize or not recognize.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 We are always in the Rupa status, or Dharmakaya status.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.000
 Never lived.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 But we destruct, we deluded, we caught up by our own dualities.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000
 Now we're back to the sport, our own dominion,

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.000
 our own sweet home, sweet home, where we belong.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 And therefore, there, all is become, how they have become here.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
 Instead of the great luminous state.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:37.000
 Luminous state, all the Muslims, all the competitions are shining so beautifully.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:43.000
 At that time, in the competition, the Muslims were shining so beautifully together.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 And we will not make any negative activity that will hurt the others,

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
 to our own side.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 We're not accumulating more habit patterns.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 The garbage, we're not collecting.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
 Back that way. We're releasing now, freeing ourselves,

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000
 pretty from the garbage of the obscurations and habit patterns.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000
 At that time here, they said, pretty from the effort,

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000
 he moved by abiding in the sky.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000
 You are relaxed in the sky, straight to the Rupa.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000
 Whether you are sleeping, you are in the Rupa status.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000
 Whether you are walking, we are in the Rupa status.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 Whether we are sitting down on the floor, on the chair, we are in the Rupa status.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000
 Whether we are talking to someone, we are in the Rupa status.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:36.000
 That clarity, that energy, that light, beams are shining in our heart.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:44.000
 Now, all our dominions of the perceptions are now transforming into the luminous state clarity

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000
 or Dharmakaya or Trikaya status, religious.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:54.000
 Everything here, all that, whatever activity we do,

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.000
 are like weather displays, sky, in a true nature.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 Everything is really just like merging and happening.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.000
 There's nothing in it that substantially solid kind of going to bed.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000
 Everything is display of the wisdom.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000
 Next one, this page is 17.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.000
 At that time, they are, or we are, for example, we continue to do,

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 we are beyond helping or hurting in several regions.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000
 Everything, because why?

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 We are totally pure in the status of the loving kindness and the compassion

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
 and the Rupa state with emptiness combined, target inseparable.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:42.000
 So, all our activities become activity of Dharmakaya, activity of the Sambukaya,

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 activity of the Dharmakayas.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000
 There's nothing to sort it out.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 All is benefitting to those beings.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:58.000
 At the same time, we are refining, reactivating our realizations,

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000
 understanding of the Rupa.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:07.000
 At the same time, we are cleaning, settle those obscurations and habitiveness.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000
 And when that happens, what is it?

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000
 There's someone who that, that when that will happen,

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000
 practice this leg in this way.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000
 The marvelous sky yogis.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000
 Now this sky yogi.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000
 The whole entire universe is transformed.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000
 The sea is not transformed.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:31.000
 Now you begin or we begin to see everything is sky state of Dharmakaya.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000
 Everything is sky state of Dharmakaya.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:42.000
 And all this place of what we are arising from this space of that is Sambukaya and Dharmakaya.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:51.000
 You completely begin to see the external universe and the world as Thirikaya matters.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000
 That yogi is great.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000
 The yogini is great.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000
 That is really, now they're back to the dominion.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:07.000
 The origin status, for a long time we are completely diluted, carried forth with our own delusions.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000
 Now we're returning.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.000
 We're getting closer to our own throngs.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000
 Throna of Dharmakaya.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000
 We begin to see the palace of Dharmakaya.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000
 Palace of the Rupa.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 And we begin to see.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:27.000
 Now really truly we are begin to capture our own domain of the origin status.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:33.000
 And that time, then, that time or the in process of these practices, what it comes here.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 The devotion, the pain, the compassion, the wisdom, so forth, you have come naturally.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:46.000
 When we begin to practice and meditate generally, as much as you got the realization of the yogini,

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000
 that much devotion comes.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 That much compassion comes.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 That much you can understand of all these world things.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 That you see clearly of what is in permanent.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000
 And cause and affect us.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000
 The precious lives of us and others.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.000
 So easy.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000
 Don't have to make any effort.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000
 We will not going to think it's kind of, oh, I don't need this.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.000
 Because part of them is split.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000
 Why we're rejecting that?

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 That is not the Dhokti teaching.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:24.000
 We're rejecting something except we need dualities.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000
 Another form of dualities.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000
 It's dualities.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:37.000
 So when that happens, when these are coming, so that means all the actualizing both each other.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000
 It's all coming so far for me.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000
 Because absolute both each other.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:48.000
 Now you're discovering, become so strong and clear as billion sun in the heart.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.000
 Then actualizing both each other is coming so beautifully.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000
 Just growing perfectly.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.000
 Actualizing both each other activities are principally summarized

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.000
 by the great teacher, Bodhaka Yamali, in the six paramattas.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.000
 So six paramattas activity is coming so beautifully.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 Talking with this, this, all this devotion.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000
 Both each other.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:22.000
 Then the porno session talk and as well as then it's all part of the six paramattas practices.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000
 And then our knowledge is shining.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000
 Wisdom is shining.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000
 That's called omniscient status.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000
 Omniscient is coming because there are no blockage of the creation.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000
 Habitat is not blocking our inborn wisdom.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000
 It's really coming.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000
 So then, and all this was in teaching session.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:47.000
 All the art in the Bhumi and the Patas are growing.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000
 Then you're really advancing.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000
 According general Buddhism, we are advancing.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000
 Then five path and ten Bhumi.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000
 According to the teaching, as I listed yesterday,

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.000
 four visions are we advancing.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.000
 This path in the Bhumi and the poor vision is not externally existing.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:13.000
 Is it level measured our inner realization of the Rupa?

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000
 If it is not a Rupa.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000
 When you got how much we discovered, you can.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:23.000
 This is a Tamil material of our realization measured by this.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000
 This, you can see.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000
 Even you got the realization, highest realization.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:36.000
 Still calm, peaceful, humble, simple, drawn to the earth.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 Generally, when you got the realization in the teaching session,

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 that individual, that breathtaking will become so humble, so simple,

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:49.000
 because no ego clinging, no emotion such as arrogance.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000
 Never mind any choice.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.000
 We need come to the phenomena or in the law of the karmas.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000
 Never going to ignore trying to suppress,

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:06.000
 always kind of bring the walls of the dokki teaching, trying to suppress, undermine.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 No, that is not practicing.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000
 According to the Ayana teaching, in the Buddha teaching,

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000
 and Gurbimasambha teachings.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:21.000
 The more you have the realization, the more you become humble, simple,

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:28.000
 more content, more grateful, more graceful, more common sense.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000
 When you talk about the law and the comparison,

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:36.000
 boneless love, boneless compassion, boneless joy,

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:41.000
 joy to all the living beings without any discriminations.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 One great teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni said in his teachings,

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:52.000
 "I love all the sentient beings, all the beings as my only child."

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000
 Child, that is what really does.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.000
 Infinite love, infinite compassion.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.000
 When you love, have someone has love,

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:06.000
 the respect and appreciation comes to that moment, to that individuals.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:11.000
 Julius, and this is just, that is part of this, what he said.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:17.000
 It all comes upon tenuousness, naturals, naturals, all that.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000
 Naturals.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000
 At that time, that is gurus, samala, samala gurus.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000
 And that moment, then when we are reaching more,

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.000
 and then we breathe from the heart and the face.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000
 And then great birth and no cessation.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000
 It's great, then great.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:38.000
 Then this moment we reach into the ultimate, almost close to the ultimate states.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:45.000
 Then we don't have any hopes, hopes to reach enlightenment,

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:50.000
 or any fears that I'm going to be falling to the samsara.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:57.000
 Because you are merging the samsara to the nirvana,

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.000
 or merging the samsara to the dharmakaya states.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:06.000
 Samsara, dharmakaya are, the boundary is collapsing,

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:13.000
 and you transforming the samsara as dharmakaya pure land.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:21.000
 Oh, the Akanista, Omini, Devachama, great pure land of the great blissful states.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:26.000
 Really, that individually is transformed, that we need to see.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:34.000
 Then everything, and yes, there's no hopes, nothing to open to get enlightenment.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000
 You're already on the status.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:43.000
 The hope and the fear, we think this and that is duality, is conception.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:49.000
 Now that is gone, that is where, where, where, in your status.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.000
 Therefore, everything becomes as enlightened as bliss.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:58.000
 And for that reason, that great master, that great practitioner,

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.000
 maybe that person, maybe he or she, whoever,

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000
 appears as person or the individual, look at the base.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 But inside, rupa is completely burst up to the Buddha who sits, enlightened.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.000
 Dharmakaya sits, karmakari sits.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.000
 The moment they, according to the teaching,

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:30.000
 the moment they pass, their physical elements dissolve back to the element.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:36.000
 Physical dissolved element back, they dissolve back to the element.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:42.000
 That awareness now bursts it as full bloom.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.000
 Like here, great master, more than I'm going to say,

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000
 big garutas now begin to fly.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000
 Flying where? In the Dharmakayas.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:59.000
 From Dharmakaya status, begin to emanate Sambukhaya and Nirmakaya,

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:05.000
 according to all the sentient beings, until everyone is reached enlightened.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000
 How are they going to emanate it?

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:12.000
 In the teaching said, continuation, pervasive without any effort.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:17.000
 That is, continuing means, continuous, not just today and tomorrow,

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 or only at this, they are going to emanate at benefit activity,

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:28.000
 then office is closed for 16 hours.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:33.000
 No. All the time, continuation.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.000
 And pervasive means, not just pervasive means to everyone,

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:44.000
 not just short place or just selective groups for whom beings are not animals.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:50.000
 But all the beings, override beings, they are going to pervasive the benefits.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:57.000
 And when they benefit all that, now is big hardship, big effort, big kind of dragging,

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000
 "Oh, I have to do this and that."

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:04.000
 No. It's continuity, spontaneously.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:09.000
 Continuation, pervasive, spontaneous without any effort.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.000
 That's how they are going to benefit.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:17.000
 And that's when stages, and that is here, next page, you know.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 Next page is Imahu.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.000
 Imahu. How wonderful. Imahu sounds terrible.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000
 How wonderful. How amazing.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000
 Now you discover or we discover that individually,

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.000
 discover there in it, nature as they have.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:42.000
 We don't obscure and cover up by the creation of duality.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.000
 Duality is gone. Obscuration is gone.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000
 Negative emotions are gone.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.000
 Now all transformed into great wisdom series.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:56.000
 Therefore, everything for this enlightenment, everything means what?

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.000
 What they see, what they hear, what they smell, what they taste,

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.000
 what they feel, what do you see, everything is in like a stage.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000
 Not just a small group, this and that also, kind of selective things.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.000
 They're everything in that stage.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000
 Then here, great master, Mahatma just kind of concluding this,

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000
 "Where did this come from? How did that happen?"

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000
 He says, "The resolve of the awakened life is too various."

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:32.000
 That means in order to reach this, we have to make this with accumulation of practice.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.000
 It's a very combined topic.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.000
 Great Master, he told me, you know what he said, in one of his teachings.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.000
 He said, "When we are practicing, where we are practicing?

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 Practition, we need four triggers."

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:51.000
 He said, "This is the trigger of the wealth of all the practitioners."

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:56.000
 He said, "Shouldn't we miss or shouldn't we lose these triggers, this wealth?

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 W-E-A-L-T-N, wealth."

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000
 And we've missed those wealth.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000
 Then our spiritual become poor, our practices become poor,

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.000
 more pathetic, more powerful in these stages.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:15.000
 Whenever we have these four, we will be rich, always rich of the practice.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:20.000
 That means when we are rich of the practice, that means we are accumulating various things.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:25.000
 A community marriage, Muslim marriage, both are building up.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:31.000
 Please, at that moment, what we are doing, that moment, as much as we build a marriage, that much

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000
 is probably fine.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:39.000
 Obscurations, emotions, observations, knowledge obscurations.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:44.000
 You can use the habit pattern, all habit patterns are clean.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000
 What are those four wealth?

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.000
 Listen, whatever you know, wealth.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:57.000
 First is devotion to the lineage, joy and devotion to the lineage,

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.000
 and to the Bodhisattva Sangha's devotion.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:11.000
 Second wealth is love and affection to all the Sangha members and then all the beings.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:32.000
 That. And third wealth is great compassion for all the beings of six realms.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:44.000
 And third, or sorry, fourth trigger is always have thought of the impermanence, impermanence.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:49.000
 But for those renunciation, what we discussed, the impermanence, are you good?

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:57.000
 Fourth, those are the great master, his only union which highlights as wealth of the practitioners.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000
 And we are missing those wealth.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000
 That means that we are not so rich of them.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:11.000
 Then we could go, go down, become more poorer, poorer, poorer, and then maybe rich.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.000
 And we have company, then we have to apply bankruptcies, policies.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.000
 Then, that's it, then close the door.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000
 What does that happen?

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:27.000
 So therefore, if we like to make rich, wealthy, competent, upper class, and then billionaire,

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:34.000
 this is what great master, his whole union, we said, we should have this thought, really thought.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.000
 So with that, then accumulate the merits, merits.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:45.000
 Then it will reveal, again summarizing like this, and that will reveal this primordial business,

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000
 primordial business as we discussed earlier.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000
 And then it's part of the whole phenomenon.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:55.000
 And how the great master, the one who got this realization, he said,

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:00.000
 because again wealth of this, what his own union would make in wealth,

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.000
 because he's remembering, being grateful to the teacher.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:10.000
 I realize this comes from the beat and structure of the lama or lineage.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:15.000
 And without the difficulty, you have, or if I apply tomorrow,

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:20.000
 I have this in my arms and my hand.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.000
 How amazing.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.000
 And if we do that, we will get the same.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:29.000
 Relatation of the Buddha nature, in Buddhahood or Dharmakaya,

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:34.000
 is not just reserved by the selected gurus, or it has copy right.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.000
 No?

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.000
 We all have the right to be enlightened.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:43.000
 So we will get, as entirely as a great master, my hormone called realization,

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000
 as a unkeeper of that.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:51.000
 So that is like, again, reactivating, glorifying, and appreciating,

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:57.000
 and rejoicing, and aspire to us that we should do the same way.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000
 So that is what is.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:07.000
 Next two lines are the dedication and aspirations.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:11.000
 That is then, you see here, I don't have to talk that.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.000
 And this is the great master, then he said, in that date.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:22.000
 Then this was written by, or spoken, or taught by the mama-jambhir,

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:28.000
 mind of the fine fire monkey here, and it's just a separate source.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:33.000
 So this, and then by this, the dedication is so important.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.000
 And now I complete the breathing about this entire teaching,

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:42.000
 and went to that common ascension point of teaching, teachings,

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.000
 and I get that.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.000
 But again, I like to say, just summarize this teaching.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000
 But how will we practice this?

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.000
 How we do it?

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.000
 I mean, of course, you all know.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.000
 Put this into the three novels.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000
 In the debate, called tambasana.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.000
 Beginning tamba, middle tamba, and konkuluri tamba.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:05.000
 So that means beginning good, middle good, konkuluri good.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:10.000
 Beginning good is started with devotion, bodhicata, and appreciation,

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:15.000
 and you do those daily practices of the devotional practices,

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:20.000
 and as well as rafu and bodhicata.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.000
 Activate it.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.000
 And then also same time, those four renunciations told.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.000
 And we have time, and it reflected those short times.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.000
 So that is the beginning.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:34.000
 In the middle, then you do the documentation, as we went through.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.000
 At the end, that means end of the session,

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.000
 when you're going to end the session, and do good dedication.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.000
 That's the great Master of Honor with aspiration.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.000
 Dedicated in that which manage to all the sentient beings,

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:53.000
 really manage all living beings to remove their suffering,

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.000
 the difficult troubles, and reach everyone to enlightenment

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.000
 and discover their inner nature,

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:02.000
 so that all will become more calm and peaceful also immediately,

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:07.000
 and then in the long-term, everyone will bring to enlightenment status.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:11.000
 So really wish that stone in the heart and the mind,

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.000
 and then do all your dedication, prayers.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.000
 Prayers, and that's generally all the practices,

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.000
 according to teaching, the linear instruction,

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.000
 you should put those every practice of that three frames.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.000
 Beginning good means a good motivation, a good intention, a good thought,

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:33.000
 and then do the practices, and do good dedication, prayers.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.000
 And aspiration, prayers, and wishing.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.000
 Dedicated your merit, at the same time, what you want to be.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000
 Here, good Master of Honor with me.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:48.000
 May everyone discover that absolutely, in any nature, manjushiri.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.000
 That's the problem, that's the requirement, manjushiri.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.000
 May everyone discover that.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:58.000
 Really, he prayed because of merit of this, merit of his teachings.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.000
 That's what in the teachings is.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.000
 They may all actually discover their inner natures.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.000
 So that is very much my teachings,

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.000
 and thank you very much again for your participation,

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.000
 and thank you for your dedication and your dharma,

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:17.000
 and you're all very devoted whoever here,

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.000
 I'm sure that you're really devoted,

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:23.000
 and kind of very practicing.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:27.000
 So I really encourage you all to practice and meditate

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:30.000
 as much as you can do in this world.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.000
 We have these opportunities, and this is wonderful.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:36.000
 And great, and thank you everyone again for participating.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.000
 And then, once I'm a member,

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.000
 I ask that I can give the transmission of this teaching,

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000
 but I really don't do the transmission on the line,

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.000
 or any of those I can do,

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.000
 because I don't have the capability to do those.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.000
 So I don't do the transmission,

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:54.000
 but those individually, I'll give you all,

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.000
 by the devoted teaching of the Buddha Dhamma

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.000
 and the particularly zoki teaching.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:03.000
 So this modern body teaching is modern body, such a great teacher,

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:04.000
 and it's very popular.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000
 Everybody honors him,

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000
 particularly yinma and god is,

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.000
 so you can, those lineage master who have this transmission

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000
 or the lineage teaching,

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.000
 and then you can ask, and since it's also not too long,

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.000
 I think they can be easily that.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.000
 For me, time, even you didn't receive the transmission,

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000
 but I think that will be generally all connected

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.000
 to the yinma teaching, to the modern body.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.000
 Therefore, with devotion, the devotion,

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.000
 when you have the power of the mind and devotion,

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.000
 then really it changes behind the scene.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000
 It makes something so magical,

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.000
 things according to teaching, every time I mention that.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:47.000
 So therefore, then you even didn't receive the,

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.000
 actually transmission, but you practice it,

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:54.000
 I'm really pretty much sure we got the same benefit, the realization.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:58.000
 But also don't just lead that way, honor the lineage.

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:01.000
 So therefore, whenever you have the opportunity

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:05.000
 and meet some teacher who has this lineage teaching

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.000
 and ask them transmission,

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.000
 I'm sure they will be happy to you all.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.000
 And that's what I just thought. Thank you.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.000
 Thank you very much, everyone.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.000
 And now, if we have time, we're going to do practice

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:24.000
 of the earth and assembly celebration with our yokchi retreat

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.000
 or yokchi teaching. It's wonderful.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.000
 Thank you, everyone, again.
