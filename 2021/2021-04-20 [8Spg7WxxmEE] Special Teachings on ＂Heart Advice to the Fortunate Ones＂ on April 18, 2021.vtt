00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:37.200
 >> Again, thank you very much everyone. Again, as I said already, your

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:47.200
 participation. Thank you very much. Your participation. Thank you so much again. Making

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:54.680
 all your joyful effort for the Dharma and making arranging the time and participating. It is

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:55.200
 wonderful.

00:20:55.200 --> 00:21:03.200
 It is beautiful. It is practicing Dharma. Dharma. And we are going to discuss the teaching

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:09.200
 of the greatest teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni. Lineage Masters. According to my capabilities,

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:17.200
 somebody I hope it will refresh, restenstiny, or be gently reminding of all your beautiful

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:23.200
 memories of Dharma that you received from many great Masters. So, that's what we

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:29.200
 are doing together. So, that means then we are perfectly gathered together as Sangha

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:36.200
 communities. What in the teaching said? Sangha means support to each other, help to each

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:44.200
 other, and inspire to meet each other, accord in the capabilities, and learn the teaching

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:50.200
 and moving forward. So, that context we are doing that. So, it is very wonderful and beautiful.

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:55.200
 And today, we are going to do what? Again, I am going to talk really teachings of the

00:21:55.200 --> 00:22:00.200
 great Master, his own Daju Rinpoche, which is teaching of the essence, teaching of the

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:06.200
 Buddha Shakyamuni. And after that, we do the healing practices. Healing practices,

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:12.200
 there are so many difficulties and troubles going in the world. And it is also not just

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:18.200
 only the sickness, the troubles. There are so many emotional troubles. This is ongoing

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:25.200
 such a vacuum in the samsara. It is not just only now. Throughout the history of the samsara,

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:34.200
 there are always troubles of these mental problems as well as psychological problems

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:43.200
 and physical problems that are part of the nature of the samsara. But what we can do?

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:50.200
 One of the best tools to do is really do good activities, dharma practices. Dedicated to

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:56.200
 that for all the beings, to our loved ones, our relatives, our friends, family members,

00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:04.200
 and all the country and beyond, all the beings of six realms. That is the practicing of dharma,

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:11.200
 following the footsteps of the Bodhicchata. So, with this, again, that is what we do today.

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:18.200
 And again, to do that, always in the teaching, remind that to all of us, is restrengthen our

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:26.200
 beautiful motivation. Motivation of the joy in appreciation. Motivation of the Bodhicchata.

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:37.200
 That is an addition. Motivation of the joy in appreciation is general, more common sense levels.

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:41.200
 And that is the foundation of the Buddha teaching, the essence of the Buddha teaching.

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:49.200
 Above that is the Bodhicchata, which is the extraordinary teaching of the gracious teacher,

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:55.200
 Bodhicchaka Mani. Thinking of all the sentient beings, I am going to do the practice.

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:59.200
 I am going to reflect with the teaching. I am going to start the teaching,

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:07.200
 and contemplating, and meditating, and practices. That motivation is so powerful, important,

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:14.200
 it really according to the teaching, it will turn the entirely game of our practices.

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:22.200
 It becomes so powerful, so strong, so deep, and it reaches far beyond, that we even,

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:30.200
 maybe not imagine, how far it is going. So, therefore, activate the Bodhicchata. Thinking of that.

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:34.200
 And then, together with this, purity, understand.

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:39.200
 Purity realization, in the teaching, always said, "See the purity."

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:46.200
 Those teachings are known as three, whether status, whether body, whether speech,

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:55.200
 whether verse, mind, and space, all five perfect, that many of you already know those five perfect,

00:24:55.200 --> 00:25:09.200
 perfect place, perfect teachings, perfect audience, all at a time, and as well as teachers.

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:16.200
 Although, see, that means, not just a teacher who is speaking, who I am speaking, but who has to

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:16.200
 think perfect,

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:21.200
 but everything perfect, including yourself.

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:27.200
 That means, we are not relying on the world of duality in the dogma status.

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:36.200
 We are returning back to our origin status, origin state of the Buddha mind.

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:43.200
 When we wake up that Buddha mind, and when you look to their own,

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:55.200
 everything is in that status, five perfect, perfect teacher, perfect place, perfect teaching,

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.200
 perfect time,

00:25:56.200 --> 00:26:02.200
 and as well as perfect audience. Those are five perfect in the teaching state.

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:08.200
 So, either one is we should really think, or we are in that perfect status.

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:14.200
 Kind of having that opening of those minds is so, in a teaching state, it is very important,

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:17.200
 particularly with the practitioners of Vedayana.

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:20.200
 Vedayana, we meditate that.

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:26.200
 We visualize ourselves, which is known as creation stages.

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:30.200
 We see entirely universal, ourself transform the deity.

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:34.200
 That means, you become Buddha, or we become the Buddha.

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:39.200
 That means, our own innate nature of the mind,

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:45.200
 ordinary nature, free from the duality and obscuration, now,

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:49.200
 wake up as it is.

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:55.200
 So, that is, we have to do. Who will do? We have to do.

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:59.200
 Ourself. And why we don't start right now?

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:02.200
 Why waiting? Have to now.

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:05.200
 With courage and commitment, with confidence.

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:08.200
 That is known as the practicing dharma.

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:13.200
 And the Vedayana teacher, often making, when you visualize the deity or creation stages,

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:24.200
 always have the confidence or Vedara pride, P-R-I-D-E, Vedara pride, indestructible.

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:26.200
 That means, what means indestructible?

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:29.200
 Indestructible from the dualities,

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:36.200
 not undermined, not shaken by the dualities,

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:40.200
 doubt and hesitation, the skeptical and all that.

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:44.200
 Those are obscurations, obstacles,

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:49.200
 that under those emotions, the negative obscurations,

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:56.200
 the duality undermines our goals from a long time now.

00:27:56.200 --> 00:28:00.200
 And now, we have to have the difference.

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:07.200
 We have to change the chapter. We have to change the right directions

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.200
 to do those. Those are really the teachings said.

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:15.200
 So, we go forward, and now we follow the teaching of the great teacher,

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:19.200
 his only Vinyurumaji. His teaching, as I said many times,

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:21.200
 and you know that, I mean, it is not something.

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:25.200
 I am talking, it is the essence of the teaching of the Buddha Kshaktya Muni

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:29.200
 into the practice level. How to practice?

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:32.200
 How to put the entire teaching of the Buddha?

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:39.200
 That means, the Buddha gives the teaching age 35 until age 81,

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:42.200
 or until he enters Mahaparin nirvana.

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:47.200
 Those old teachings really can be summarized into this teaching.

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:53.200
 It is practical level, practice, our meditation practices.

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:57.200
 And that, as I said the other day, and you all know,

00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:01.200
 the entire Buddha teaching can be summarized into three,

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:09.200
 which is morality, as well as concentrations and wisdoms.

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:12.200
 Also in the teaching, how is it?

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:30.200
 The extraordinary, extraordinary, extraordinary,

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:40.200
 but the supreme, extraordinary, sorry, extraordinary morality,

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:47.200
 extraordinary concentration, extraordinary wisdoms.

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:56.200
 What that means? Generally, morality, concentration, and wisdoms we all have.

00:29:56.200 --> 00:30:02.200
 Everyone has generally had that. But this time, not just talking that,

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:11.200
 something slightly more activated, more intensified by what?

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:18.200
 Loving kindness, compassion, thinking of all the living beings,

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:26.200
 we are going to be practicing morality. And thinking of all the beings,

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:34.200
 we are concentrating, meditating, thinking of all the living beings.

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:41.200
 We are seeing things exactly as it should be, or as it is.

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:51.200
 Seeing, wisdom means what? See exactly as it is. Nothing underestimated, above estimated.

00:30:51.200 --> 00:31:01.200
 See simple nature, simple truth as it is. No cover-up, no making-up.

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:08.200
 Simple, simple, organic, direct, fresh, natural as it.

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:16.200
 When you see things that, both relative level, absolute level, that is known as wisdoms.

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:23.200
 Seeing that clearly again, with thinking, with compassion, or thinking of all beings.

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:29.200
 So therefore, whether teaching this morality, and as well as concentration,

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:35.200
 and wisdoms are known as extraordinary moralities.

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:41.200
 Extraordinary concentrations. Extraordinary wisdoms.

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:47.200
 So those are really essence of this teaching is explaining all that.

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:51.200
 So with this understanding, now, what last time we discussed.

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:58.200
 Of course, as it says many times, you know all these things, many of you already know this.

00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:03.200
 But again, see it here. When you practice generally, what we need?

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:11.200
 We need special support to actualize the practice of Dharma, special support.

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:17.200
 Those support, and teaching one said, support from the physically,

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:23.200
 support from the mentally, to support we need.

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:36.160
 Physical support is at freedom, and ten luxuries, all those are physical support to do the practice

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:37.200
 Dharma.

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:44.200
 So that means, and that also of course, as in the teaching said, is very difficult to obtain.

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:51.200
 But we have got beautiful life. We have 18 endowments. All that.

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:59.200
 That is the perfect support of the Dharma practices. Physically support.

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:05.200
 Is this enough? No. We need second.

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:10.200
 Mental support. Mental support.

00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:16.200
 So before last week, what we discussed, we went through those physical support, really that.

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:19.200
 Now, today explaining of this.

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:23.200
 This started with the mental supporters.

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:27.200
 Mental supporters. And that is what here.

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:32.200
 We looked at this page here and said, and fifth line.

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:37.200
 One, two, three, four, five, six. No, sixth line.

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:41.200
 And we went until, I think, the fifth line.

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:47.200
 Then we also discussed on the day, on the day, and Samsara according,

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:51.970
 the first of the Buddha's teachings, the direction of the teacher of the Buddha Kya Kya Muni's

00:33:51.970 --> 00:33:52.200
 first teaching

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:55.200
 is known as the poor noble truth.

00:33:55.200 --> 00:34:01.200
 Poor noble truth is suffering truth, cause of suffering truth.

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:06.200
 So those are suffering truth, cause of suffering truth.

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:12.200
 That is generally, of course, Buddha's teaching is very profound,

00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:16.200
 and very profound, and also very simple.

00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:21.200
 Poor's is very simple, suffering truth, cause of suffering truth.

00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:24.200
 Ami is very simple, direct.

00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:33.200
 But it is indicating, what we don't want, for example, in Samsara, we don't want suffering.

00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:40.200
 We, no one really likes suffering, unless we are mentally disturbed.

00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:46.200
 But then, we, since we don't like suffering, all sufferings,

00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:54.200
 but we have to also, we have to be smart to stop the cause of suffering.

00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:59.200
 That is what Buddha is highlighting, highlighting.

00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:04.200
 This suffering or difficult challenge coming in Samsara, not just coming by itself,

00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:12.200
 but casually, or somebody else doing, or yes, you can't relate, is arising.

00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:17.200
 It has cause, it has conditions.

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:26.200
 Of course, in the condition of the difficulty challenges, even we don't want difficulty challenges.

00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:30.200
 We cannot stop it really coming, coming.

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:38.200
 So, since we really don't like the difficulty, hardship, and troubles, or sufferings,

00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:47.200
 or fears, F-E-A-R-R, we have to avoid the cause.

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:50.200
 We have to be smart with the cause.

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:57.200
 Of course, it doesn't mean we should not avoid or try to stop the suffering or the fears,

00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:01.200
 but at the same time, we look at the cause.

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:07.200
 Cause is then, what? Cause of suffering, truth.

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:12.200
 Those are the negative emotions, negative emotions.

00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:21.200
 It is not somebody else putting us, it is creation of one's own self, directly or indirectly,

00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:27.200
 according to Buddhism. It is one's own creation, creating that.

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:35.680
 Unknowingly we create, we are making more cause, more conditions, having more troubles, more

00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:37.200
 difficulties.

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:43.200
 So, those are the cause of suffering, truth, and cause of suffering, truth.

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:48.200
 Once we know that, then what the greatest teacher, the brother, the secretary of ministry said,

00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:53.200
 part truth, say sacred truth, and part truth.

00:36:53.200 --> 00:37:00.200
 So now, this one, sixth line, is part truth.

00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:09.690
 Now, we are trying to really eliminate it, or eliminate it, or eliminate it to stop the cause of

00:37:09.690 --> 00:37:11.200
 suffering, truth.

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:20.690
 In order to do that, then here, somebody said here, say, the trust is the three jewels and an

00:37:20.690 --> 00:37:23.200
 infallible source of raffles.

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:31.200
 So, that is the beginning to follow the part truth.

00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:37.200
 Now, I said earlier, there is two supports we need.

00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:44.200
 One is the physical support to practice Dharma, and the second is the mental support.

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:47.200
 What is that mental support?

00:37:47.200 --> 00:38:07.620
 Mental support is our devotion, our interest is our paid, or F-A-T-T-H, F-A-I-T-H, paid, whatever

00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:12.200
 terminology we use, that we need.

00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:18.200
 So, how that will come? Paid and devotion, how it will come?

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:25.920
 In the solid of our ego, clinging, duality, sometimes it is harder to burn or to come that light in

00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:27.200
 our heart.

00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:37.200
 Our heart is always kind of hard, strong, dense, dense, with surrounded by so many misconceptions,

00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:44.200
 such as doubt, hesitation, skeptical, analytics, and all those.

00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:47.200
 Really, it is just a completely shield up our mind.

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:49.200
 How that will come?

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:57.200
 In the teaching said, the great master, Jingu Lungpa, said, I mean, this generally,

00:38:57.200 --> 00:39:04.200
 the first is, so many in the teaching said, said that devotion or the fed is the number one.

00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:07.200
 But how that will develop the fed?

00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:11.200
 In the great master, Jingu Lungpa highlighted this.

00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:20.200
 He said, there are four ways that you can develop or light up the devotions.

00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:32.190
 And that is first is, having good friend or spiritual friend, if you are accompanying, associating

00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:37.200
 with spiritual friend, that is one.

00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:48.200
 Second is, have you contracted with some very decent, common sense person, an open mind?

00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:51.200
 That is second.

00:39:51.200 --> 00:40:01.200
 And the third is, because of those, you begin to open your knowledge and reading the books.

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:07.200
 Different books, variety kind of books.

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:17.200
 And fourth, fourth is, also you may be tired in the bored of these samsara situations.

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:23.200
 Bored in the tired, the ongoing samsara situations.

00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:37.560
 Those four ways, it will turn our minds from the regular habit of parents toward spiritual and it

00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:43.200
 will bring some devotions or the fed.

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:54.530
 So therefore, what in the teaching said, tracking rafuj, rafuji is the foundation of the dharma,

00:40:54.530 --> 00:41:02.200
 but the foundation of the rafuj is fed or the devotions.

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:14.690
 And if you have that devotion, as I said, said, great master, jimilanga, sorry, highlight those

00:41:14.690 --> 00:41:15.200
 four.

00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:23.830
 Accompanying the spiritual friend, contract with the spiritual or teachers, teachers and open a

00:41:23.830 --> 00:41:31.200
 reading the books and it is seen the samsaras, difficulty in troubles.

00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:37.200
 All those four different ways then changed our mind.

00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:44.680
 And so then we take rafuji. To whom we take rafuji in Buddhism, then we will associate strongly

00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:47.200
 then to the Buddha dharma sangha.

00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:54.980
 Here the great master, his whole new number says, chok-san, so three, so three supermanas or three

00:41:54.980 --> 00:42:02.200
 jewels, jewels, which is then Buddha dharma sanghas.

00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:11.000
 And the Buddha is rafuji of enlightened beings. That means free from all the obscurations and the

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.200
 obstacles and ego-clinging.

00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:21.200
 That is really the Buddha and that means full of love, compassion, wisdom. So that is the Buddha.

00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:28.970
 In the teaching, dharma is message or the teaching of the Buddha. It is best upon the, again, truth

00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:33.200
, love and kindness, compassion, non-violence,

00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:41.200
 and how to bring peace and harmony in our own mind and to the others. That is really dharma.

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:48.800
 And the sangha is the one who is dedicated to follow that, exploring the peace and harmony, respect

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:51.200
 and appreciation to everyone.

00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:57.110
 So that is really the Buddha dharma sangha. And now, of course, you all know, they are not really

00:42:57.110 --> 00:42:58.200
 about the Buddha dharma sangha,

00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:05.200
 so I am not going to talk too much. That is this Buddha, Buddha and dharma and sangha.

00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:12.230
 And this Buddha is now, those are the, there is no difference between any Buddhism which has rafuji

00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:15.200
 to the dharma, Buddha dharma sangha.

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:19.200
 There is everyone saying that there is no difference.

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:27.150
 Then, in an inner level, according to where we are ready in the teaching, then this Buddha dharma

00:43:27.150 --> 00:43:33.200
 sangha is also termed, named as guru deva dakinis.

00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:39.200
 Those are, again, in the teaching, it is the same, different terminologies.

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:49.660
 Guru is like Buddha, deity or the Yadams are like dharma and dakini as sangha members or dakini d

00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:51.200
harmapalas as sangha members.

00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:54.200
 Those are in the teaching, in the inner level.

00:43:54.200 --> 00:44:07.810
 And mostly, in the second level, then even for example, guru deva sangha represents all the three

00:44:07.810 --> 00:44:11.200
 jewels, Buddha, dharma, sangha.

00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:17.200
 For example, guru deva sangha. The body of guru deva sangha is sangha.

00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:27.680
 The speech of guru deva sangha is dharma and the verse in the mind or compassion is then the Buddha

00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:28.200
.

00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:32.200
 Thank you. And similarly, Buddha shakhyamunyus. Same thing.

00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:41.200
 Buddha, body of the Buddha is sangha member and his teachings are the dharma

00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:48.200
 and his realisation and fulfilment in world is Buddha.

00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:57.200
 So, that way, all within the one state is Buddha dharma sangha, all in one single state.

00:44:57.200 --> 00:45:03.640
 Therefore, always in the teaching said, when we see the guru deva sangha as in body member, all

00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:06.200
 three jewels, all the Buddhas

00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:13.680
 and then also any other those highly qualified teachers can be like as represented by the three

00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:23.300
 jewels, all in one

00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:24.200
 toilet. And when we take this rafuj, how long we keep this connection to the Buddha dharma sangha?

00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:24.200
 Until we reach enlightenment.

00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:31.200
 Until we got the realisations. From now on, until we reach enlightenment. So, that is really.

00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:37.200
 And then, of course, there is many, that you do that according Buddhism, you do that every day.

00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:47.250
 Once in your self, in your own room or your own palace, at least take rafuj one time, that means

00:45:47.250 --> 00:45:48.200
 three times.

00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:54.390
 Kind of thinking of that. I said rafuj in the Buddha dharma sangha in order to benefit all living

00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:55.200
 beings.

00:45:55.200 --> 00:46:06.200
 This is kind of thinking of that. And those are known as then, then taking rafuj, this, this, this.

00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:19.200
 So, these three jewels and then Buddhas are the infallible, or the three jewels are infallible here

00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:19.200
.

00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:28.200
 Intelligible source of rafuj. Why it means? Because Buddha is totally enlightened beings.

00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:36.200
 That means, as you all know, is free from the ego-clinging, free from the negative emotions, free

00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:37.200
 from the old,

00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:48.520
 they are all the kind of like expectations, expectations that Buddha's love, compassion, wisdom is

00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:50.200
 free, open

00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:57.200
 to all the living beings without any discriminations, without any judgements.

00:46:57.200 --> 00:47:06.200
 And Buddha's love is true for sentient beings. According to teaching, it all means the same as

00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:12.200
 Mother loves to her own one child.

00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:18.200
 As love, her own one child. So, this is really love and compassion is equal.

00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:25.200
 And Buddha sees things, everything, exactly as it is. Both relative level and absolute level.

00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:35.200
 Therefore, then Buddha is infallible, protective, and for therefore we trust.

00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:41.710
 Trust. All the teachings are perfect, invested upon the non-volence, invested upon the ego-lessness

00:47:41.710 --> 00:47:42.200
 status,

00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:48.200
 invested upon the peace and harmonious, and it is just equal to everyone.

00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:58.200
 So therefore, then teaching, Buddha is an infallible soul. And Dharma is also his message of that.

00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:01.200
 That is the message of the Buddha Shakyamuni or Buddha.

00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:09.150
 His teaching is best upon the non-volence and as well as compassion, loving kindness, for all the

00:48:09.150 --> 00:48:10.200
 living beings.

00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:18.680
 There is no discrimination between, regardless of karma that we go through, but on that, the

00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:21.200
 teaching and the nature is the same.

00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:27.700
 Buddha gives the same teaching to everyone, accorded their desires, accorded their cup of blood in

00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:30.200
 order to lead this enlightenment.

00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:38.170
 And the Sangha members who follow that path, and practice their courage and commitment and

00:48:38.170 --> 00:48:39.200
 determination,

00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:42.200
 they are the source of our inspirations.

00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:52.200
 To the Sangha members, we learn. We learn patience. We learn courage. We learn commitment.

00:48:52.200 --> 00:49:03.200
 And we learn loving kindness, compassion, and teaching. They are supporting us and we support them.

00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:06.200
 We support each other moving along the path.

00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:12.200
 They are long last our companions until we become the enlightenment.

00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:17.200
 Therefore, without understanding, then we trust this.

00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:25.200
 So, that is like what? So, when we practice again, as I said, we need two.

00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:36.200
 The first is the physical support and the second is then faith, or the devotion.

00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:40.200
 With that, we take refuge, refuge with faith.

00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:48.840
 And according to Mahayana, not just only faith that we take refuge, but also we take refuge with

00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:50.200
 compassion too.

00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:55.200
 Thinking of all the sentient beings, really I'd like to help everyone.

00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:59.200
 Therefore, I'm going to learn teaching and practice.

00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:04.200
 I'm going to make close coordination to the Buddha, Dharma, Sanghas.

00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:07.200
 So, with that, then you take refuge.

00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:12.200
 And then next one, so that is really about this sixth line.

00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:20.200
 Seventh line is what? Now, having this and the word.

00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:29.200
 And do not be mistaken about the result of the virtuous and unvirtuous actions.

00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:39.200
 And this is now, generally again, when you take the refuge, when you follow the teaching,

00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:46.200
 then we should also should have good, as I said earlier, or in the Buddha teaching,

00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:52.200
 or as I said, a good ground of the conduct or the moralities.

00:50:52.200 --> 00:51:00.200
 That is really very, very important. Good conduct, good morality, more with common sense,

00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:08.200
 more sensible, more thoughtful, more thoughtful. Therefore, if we keep that,

00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:15.200
 then we are keeping quite good conduct, good morality lined up.

00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:22.200
 And how to do that? That is in the equivalent teaching, say, be mindfulness.

00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:27.200
 Mindfulness, alertness, and consciousness.

00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:38.200
 Those three are the very best support, best teacher for our activities, actions.

00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:43.200
 And here, again, what in the teaching said here?

00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:49.200
 Do not, his whole journey which is virtuous and unvirtuous actions, actions.

00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:59.200
 So, actually, this said, therefore, we should not mistakenly, that we have to be careful.

00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:03.200
 We should be careful or very thoughtful with our actions.

00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:13.200
 This is also virtuous and unvirtuous, which can be named as positive or negatives.

00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:23.200
 This positive, negative way is coming. It is not from outside, again.

00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:32.200
 It starts from our own mind. This positive and negative is also known as karma.

00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:40.200
 And a larger name, it is. Another name, it is positive truths.

00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:45.200
 Again, suffering truths, the cause of suffering truths.

00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:50.200
 This positive truths, what the great teacher Buddha gave.

00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:54.200
 So, now, since we are following the positive truths, positive truths,

00:52:54.200 --> 00:53:02.200
 we should know more clearly what is the obstacle for our positive truths.

00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:09.200
 The positive truths mean we are following the path, we are advancing.

00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:14.200
 If we undermine our positive truths with our old habit patterns

00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:20.200
 or our mundane habit patterns, then even if we are following the positive truths,

00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:31.200
 we are completely undermining, we dilute, we become pouring to the ditch or the site.

00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:40.200
 Therefore, we should always be very thoughtful with our actions.

00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:45.200
 When we have good thoughts, we are thoughtful with our actions.

00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:52.200
 That is morality. And when we are thoughtful, what is developed?

00:53:52.200 --> 00:54:02.200
 It develops more common sense, more gentle, more peaceful, more calm,

00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:07.200
 more really soothing to our heart and mind.

00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:13.200
 And also that energy will help to your friend or our friend,

00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:18.200
 our family member, to others too. It will reflect that.

00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:23.200
 Therefore, how we started that? We have to start from our mind.

00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:28.200
 Here I say the virtues and unvirtues. Of course, you all know this.

00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:32.200
 What the great master again, of course, is Buddha's teaching.

00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:48.340
 The great master Nagarjuna said, "What are virtues? Wisdom and detachment, compassion, those are

00:54:48.340 --> 00:54:51.200
 virtues."

00:54:51.200 --> 00:55:07.200
 "Macha, madhe, mohmi" or as translated, "wisdom and detachment and compassion."

00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:12.200
 That is positive. That is the virtues.

00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:20.200
 If we think the virtues or the positive, good things, that is right with our heart, in our trade.

00:55:20.200 --> 00:55:25.200
 We have to pour or we have to revere. We have to revere.

00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:31.200
 Every revere, the wisdom, wisdom is not just one's pieces.

00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:42.910
 There is infinite wisdom in our trade or our state of the mind of the infinite or the Buddha nature

00:55:42.910 --> 00:55:43.200
.

00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:51.200
 It has infinite. When you revere, the detachment is not just one's time and gone.

00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:58.200
 You are revering more. The treasures begin to overflowing really as much as you open.

00:55:58.200 --> 00:56:06.310
 That much is overcoming. As much as you will start to be compassionate once, that much your

00:56:06.310 --> 00:56:08.200
 compassion will grow.

00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:14.200
 Loving kindness will come. All those beautiful abundance are really arising.

00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:24.200
 When it arises in our heart, then what is going up to all our system, our physical, our verbal?

00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:33.200
 All those are transforming now into wisdom, detachment and compassion, loving kindness activities.

00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:40.200
 When that reflects externally, it is positive actions, good things.

00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:45.200
 And that which is known as then in the Buddha teaching, good karma.

00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:52.200
 Creating good karma is following the path, a symbol I will say, following the path.

00:56:52.200 --> 00:57:02.200
 Path, you are reversing. You are reversing or we are uprooting our old habit pattern,

00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:07.200
 which is suffering truth or cause of suffering truth.

00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:14.200
 We are undermining. We are revealing that goodness. So that is what it is.

00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:21.200
 On the other hand, what is the negatives or unvirtues is the same.

00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:36.200
 It is opposite of those three, what we discussed. And which is ignorance, attachment and anger.

00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:47.200
 Those are the unvirtues and negatives. They are also another name.

00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:51.200
 They are the causes of suffering truth.

00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:58.200
 Why here, Guruji's teacher Buddha used truth or suffering truth?

00:57:58.200 --> 00:58:07.200
 Because when we go through these sufferings, it is really, even though it has nothing kind of solid

00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:07.200
 source,

00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:14.200
 but it fills truth. We go through those uncomfortable pains.

00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:18.200
 Therefore, it is called suffering truth.

00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:24.200
 Cause of suffering truth is also, there is no substantial existence in this emotion.

00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:30.200
 You can hold and say, "Oh, hi, this is anger. This is ignorance. This is worship."

00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:37.200
 There is nothing that we can tell, but when it arises that magic, that show,

00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:46.200
 it really created the uncomfortable, truly that we can see nobody can ignore or deny.

00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:53.200
 Therefore, it is truth. It is truth. It is happening.

00:58:53.200 --> 00:59:00.200
 It is like, for that reason, many times in teaching, it is like a nightmare, like situation.

00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:08.200
 Even there is no solid existence by our own mistake, by our own habitus patens.

00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:17.200
 Truly, we are experienced. We are going through that, that turbulence, turbulence.

00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:21.200
 Therefore, it is truth, suffering.

00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:26.200
 Is there suffering truth? Cause of suffering truth.

00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:35.200
 So, this, in order to avoid this, then here, say, be thoughtful with actions.

00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:40.200
 All actions, even the smallest good things, shouldn't think,

00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:45.200
 "Oh, it doesn't, it is not, it doesn't meet, or it is not too much."

00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:47.200
 You should not, we should not think.

00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:52.200
 In the teaching, even the smallest good activity with your good heart,

00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:58.200
 reflect me with the love and the compassion. When we worship them, it is good.

00:59:58.200 --> 01:00:03.200
 It is good. It will be an enormous result.

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:09.200
 Not just a result, one time in the teaching said, "It has ten reactions."

01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:15.200
 Really in the teaching, same way, even in the smallest and negative activities.

01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:20.200
 Same thing, we shouldn't think, "Oh, that's okay. It's not a big deal."

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:23.200
 We shouldn't think that. Be thoughtful.

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:25.200
 Every action is that.

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:32.200
 Then we become, ourselves, more wise, more practical, more sensible.

01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:39.200
 And that will create more harmony, more friendships, friendships.

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:46.200
 And then we can stay this life with happy, with joy and peace.

01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:54.200
 And leave this world with happy and joy, joy in some degree, fulfillment that we have.

01:00:54.200 --> 01:01:00.200
 Then, wonderful. That all starts with ourselves.

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:03.200
 It is not going to start from outside.

01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:05.200
 As the greatest teacher of the Buddha, here, came and said,

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:09.200
 "I gave you the teaching, or I gave you the skill and the method,

01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:13.200
 but we have to put that in the actions."

01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:21.200
 So, therefore, here, after you take refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, Sangha,

01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:25.200
 and with confidence and joy and compassion,

01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:28.200
 then the next one, what?

01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:33.200
 The following part is always thoughtful with our actions.

01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:35.200
 Thoughtful with our actions.

01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:42.200
 And we become more thoughtful with our actions and avoiding negative activities.

01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:44.200
 We should be happy and joy.

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:49.200
 We should acknowledge ourselves, "Oh, I am doing quite good."

01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:54.200
 "I did yesterday quite good, and I am doing today also quite good."

01:01:54.200 --> 01:02:00.200
 And have some relief of the commitment and attitude that, "I will do good tomorrow too."

01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:06.200
 May that happen by the blessings of Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha.

01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:13.200
 Really thinking of that, kind of setting up our commitment and that goal,

01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:17.200
 setting up, that is known as practicing Dharma.

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:23.200
 We practice, not just take refuge and then just drop things.

01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:27.200
 We add one thing. We are building up the momentum.

01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:31.200
 Then we really, really take off. So nice and beautiful.

01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:35.200
 Fully to benefit ourselves to the others.

01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:40.200
 At the same time as the negative activities, something happening,

01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:46.200
 and immediately trying to acknowledge that, "Oh, something happened.

01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:50.200
 Something I did with your friend, with your family."

01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:55.200
 Or something that you just, ever it catches by the mindfulness at that time.

01:02:55.200 --> 01:03:01.200
 Then excuse, forgive. Those are really good.

01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:06.200
 Good, excuse, forgive. And some relief of the thing, "Oh, I should not do that."

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:11.200
 "I am not good." "It is not good for me." "It is not good for my family or others."

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:15.200
 "I should not do that." "Should not do that."

01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:19.200
 "Should not that happen yesterday or last week?"

01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:23.200
 "And I am not going to today, and I will not do it tomorrow."

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:27.200
 That also by the blessings of the Buddha and the Buddha Dharma Sangha,

01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:31.200
 all the enlightened beings, I prefer that goal.

01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:36.200
 Kind of having those attentional thought, creating a little bit on your own,

01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:42.200
 our own agenda in a way, creating. That is practicing and that is also practical.

01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:48.200
 Practical. Kind of with that, then good developing that.

01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:54.200
 So, and the next one is again, now, from now on, is following the path.

01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:59.200
 So now, we are following the path. Next one is, what?

01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:08.200
 Here. This is full wealth of the Dharma or spiritual.

01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:12.200
 Full wealth of the spiritual. Those full wealth.

01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:20.200
 And which is what? Wealth. W-E-A-L-T-H.

01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:28.200
 Wealth or the treasles? Full treasles of the practitioners.

01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:34.200
 This we should always have this wealth. Every time, really we should have.

01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:40.200
 If we have this full, what listed here, along with all those teachings, what is said,

01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:46.200
 then our spiritual is become so rich, not kind of drying up.

01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:53.200
 Many times, practically we do with excitement, joy and appreciation.

01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:59.200
 But then kind of time goes on, since we don't really kind of reactivate our abundances,

01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:02.200
 then it's almost kind of getting fading away.

01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:07.200
 Become kind of like weaker and weaker and weaker.

01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:10.200
 And then, yes, it becomes almost kind of boring.

01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:14.200
 Boring, there is no kind of like any things happening.

01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:18.200
 Why that happened? Because our wealth is going down.

01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:22.200
 This wealth, this full wealth is going down.

01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:26.200
 And therefore, activated this full wealth.

01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:29.200
 It's not this wealth is going to come from outside.

01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:33.200
 It's like, what they call stock market, all those things.

01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:35.200
 It's not really going to come out.

01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:39.200
 It is, we have to activate it ourselves.

01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:47.200
 Ourself, we have the right capabilities, right authority, right freedom, right things to do.

01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:49.200
 We have to reach.

01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:55.200
 When we have this full wealth, our heart will be so rich.

01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:59.200
 Even maybe externally, there is some difficult troubles.

01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:04.200
 But really, I think we will stay quite happy in the joy.

01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:09.200
 According to teaching, according to those great masters or great practitioners

01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:13.200
 who demonstrated that.

01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:18.200
 And many times, those great practitioners who had so difficult troubles,

01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:21.200
 even they are staying in some kind of like, what's called,

01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:24.200
 they are not accidentally or some wrong reason,

01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:29.200
 they put so many kind of troubles, precious, by the authorities, all that.

01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:33.200
 But their heart is really full, full of hope,

01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:38.200
 happy in the joy, in peace, peace and loving-kindness, really is happening.

01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:43.200
 So, therefore, these four are so important and all the practitioners,

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:48.200
 and since we all practitioners and we like to give our practice

01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:51.200
 a rich and a strong and a prosperous status,

01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:54.200
 those are, these four are really so important.

01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:56.200
 And I remember that.

01:06:56.200 --> 01:06:58.200
 I think he has his own dungeon, we sit here.

01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:00.200
 And those are, what?

01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:08.200
 Can you see the first is devotion to the teacher, all root teachers.

 And then love and affection towards the Samayat brothers and sisters, second.

01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:23.200
 And the third is bodhicata of compassion towards all the mother-centered beings.

01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:29.200
 And the fourth is the reduction of the grasping due to the knowledge

01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:33.200
 that all compounded things are impermanent.

01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:40.200
 These four are treasures here, for that reason, here, what he is eliciting.

01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:46.200
