00:00:00.000 --> 00:01:34.720  
 [Tibetan]

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:42.540  
 And in that way, the gracious teacher, when Buddha spoke—or taught—the first teaching is  

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.400  
 the Four Noble Truths.  

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:50.840  
 What he said first to his first disciples and all those celestial beings and animals.  

00:01:50.840 --> 00:02:00.080  
 First, he said it must be recognized: the suffering. Suffering, that should be recognized.  

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.240  
 That is what really was his first teaching.  

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:10.720  
 This suffering is kind of like a low undercurrent to how we are at all times. 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:11.200  
 We all have these sufferings.    

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.960  
 In samsara, of course, there are also many good things I have.  

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:20.520  
 But the suffering is the highlighted kind of situation in samsara that we go through.  

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.890  
 There are good things—we don’t kind of highlight those—and they almost go by very quickly,  

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.200  
 very... kind of like the speed of light.  

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.760  
 But the sadness and suffering, something difficult like that, seems to stay a long time.  

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:44.960  
 And for that reason, Buddha said, "First recognize," or you should see the suffering.  

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:50.480  
 This suffering, again, there are many different kinds of sufferings as the Buddha’s teaching said.  

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.760  
 And I mean, it’s not just "the teaching said," but when we analyze this suffering situation,  

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.840  
 there are three major sufferings, often known as: The all-pervasive suffering,  

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.000  
 like low undercurrent sufferings that exist always.  

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.450  
 And there is a second suffering which is known as the changeable sufferings. And the third is then  

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.720  
 the suffering of our sufferings.  

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:23.260  
 These we always have. In samsara, we have them. That means as long as we have the duality mind of  

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:29.280  
 grasping, the clingings, we have these thoughts all the time.  

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:36.830  
 Then beside that, there are other sufferings, those are known as then such as birth, death, getting  

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:42.980  
 old, sicknesses—all that we go through. These again are sufferings or this kind of unpleasant  

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:43.840  
 situation.  

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:52.140  
 This is what is there. That definitely is. We cannot avoid it. As soon as we have birth, we cannot  

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:59.240  
 avoid sicknesses. As soon as we have birth, we cannot avoid also getting old.  

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.640  
 And as soon as we have birth, we cannot also avoid death.  

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:11.040  
 This is always there, these three things. And beside that, then often it is said in the teaching or  

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:19.000  
 —not just the teachings—we experience it ourselves that we say the sufferings of the  

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.960  
 separations from loved ones, that separation.  

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:31.880  
 And then also something that are unwanted things coming one after another, and then kind of the  

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.160  
 undesirable things coming one after another.  

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:44.300  
 And then also for us, the body is always something that is uncomfortable or needs to be always balanced  

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.720  
 and this way or that.  

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:55.360  
 Having separations from loved ones, maybe I said already, but anyway, we all go through those—like  

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.120  
 difficulties, the change of unpleasurable things that we go through always.  

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:05.440  
 Beside that, then there are so many other things also related, which one after another comes.  

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:11.610  
 This is what is part of samsara, this is part of the result of this grasping and  

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.520  
 the clingings that we hold.  

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:21.430  
 And therefore, for that reason, Buddha said first must be recognized the sufferings. Then  

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:29.140  
 second, he said must be aware of the cause of that suffering, the cause of that pleasure or  

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:33.040  
 pleasures. It is not just happening by itself.  

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:39.690  
 Everything we experience, that we go through, has cause, it has conditions. By the combination of  

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:45.720  
 cause and conditions, then it activates that, and that's what we call the sufferings.  

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:55.330  
 So the cause of those must be said—the whole source of that must be avoided. If we don't like all  

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:03.770  
 these sufferings, the changes, we must also work and deal with how to avoid that very cause  

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:10.080  
 and condition so that we will be completely, totally eliminated; not just a cover-up—kind of like  

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.680  
 passing through or cover-up or trying and pretending.  

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:23.280  
 But we uproot the very cause of that, and that's what the gracious teacher Buddha said.  

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:44.680  
 [Tibetan]  

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:58.940  
 And for that again, when we are in the teaching of the gracious teacher, when analyzed by Buddha, he said that whatever the result that comes, or this suffering, is not just developing  

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:06.450  
 by no cause and no conditions; so that means it has cause and conditions.  

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:11.920  
 These causes and conditions are also not just developing something completely different than the result  

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:19.500  
 itself. So it's not just kind of strange things developing this result. Whatever we  

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:26.710  
 experience as the result, that corresponds exactly with the cause and condition—cause and  

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:34.160  
 condition of the way things are - that exactly correspond to the result itself.  

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:39.040  
 The matching is not just kind of odd ends where developing something different; things always  

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:46.480  
 respond that way. And it is also not somebody else drawing these things and then destroying us—it is just one's own doer, and we are experiencing that. That must have something to do with our  

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:53.920  
 own self. That’s the way the system is.  

00:07:53.920 --> 00:08:00.970  
 And then when we look into it more, that's what the teacher, the gracious teacher Buddha said:  

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:04.680  
 "It is all reflecting from this mind. Mind is the source of all these difficulties and troubles."  

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:38.520  
 [Tibetan]
