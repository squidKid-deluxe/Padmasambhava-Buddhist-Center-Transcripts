00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 Good cause, good cause, good result, and that is the law of the nature.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:39.320
 And then the negative is the opposite of the positives. And that is, again, as we all know, it is

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:48.000
 opposite of love, is violence, and the opposite of compassion is anger and jealous.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:59.230
 And then the benefit to the others, the benefit to the outside, opposite, is hurting others and

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.000
 hurting ourselves.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:27.290
 And then this nature of this negative is suffering, and it is sadness, it is uncomfortable, and

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.000
 opposite of peace and harmonious.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.200
 And then it senses negative is not just only the state, but it also grows. As anger we reflect it,

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.000
 it will bring double anger.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.200
 Angle, or double anger, it grows, not just the state, that amount, it will expand, and that is the

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.000
 one how the nature is expanded.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 Cause is small, but result is big.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 When you say small, you say it is going to grow. When you say small, you say it is going to grow.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 When you say small, you say it is going to grow.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 When you say small, you say it is going to grow.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 When you say small, you say it is going to grow.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 When you say small, you say it is going to grow.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 When you say small, you say it is going to grow.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 When you say small, you say it is going to grow.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 When you say small, you say it is going to grow.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 When you say small, you say it is going to grow.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 When you say small, you say it is going to grow.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 When you say small, you say it is going to grow.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 When you say small, you say it is going to grow.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 When you say small, you say it is going to grow.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 When you say small, you say it is going to grow.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 And then of course, again opposite of loving kindness.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 Love is also unpleasant, unpleasant and unpleasant.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 All opposite love is ugly and bad.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 But love is like calm and soothing, loving kindness.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 Clearly, you don't want soothing and lonely.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 It is beautiful.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:58.460
 Opposite of love is then completely like unpleasant, unpleasant, ugly, disgust, violence, uncomfort

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:59.000
able,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 and then kind of very traumatic, our heart and mind.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 And that is the opposite of love.
