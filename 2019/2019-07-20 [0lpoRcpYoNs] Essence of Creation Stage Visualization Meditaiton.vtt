00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.960
 Now among these two practices, visualization and accomplishment practice also can be another

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:17.120
 way to explain. Another terminology in the teaching said that yoga of the body meditation

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:28.560
 or divine image meditation, yoga of the divine speech repetition meditation and yoga of the

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:36.080
 clear light luminosity, yoga of the divine clear light luminosity meditation. Those are the three

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:43.440
 again in that way, body, speech, mind. Now we see these three are, that is to summarize

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.680
 the both the creation stage and the complete stage or the deserving stage. And so now what is

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:57.520
 the what is the creation stage? The creation stage is the body yoga of the body meditation

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:04.000
 and the repetition of the speech meditation is creation stage practices. Yoga of a clear light

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.360
 luminosity meditation of the mind that is complete stage practices. So even though these three

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.320
 again

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:22.400
 can summarize into two. Now with this, now we go over the first one, the body visualization,

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:29.440
 our divine body image meditation. Image visualizations are how to start these practices.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.920
 That is in the according to the teaching, particularly in the Mahayoga teaching,

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:43.360
 teaching start with the three samadhis. And this now it is all can be can be kind of what's called

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:54.800
 can be can be highlighted with yoga of the body divine meditation. We can highlight those these

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:06.080
 these problems. The first is three samadhis. Second is visualizing the medulla and the universe.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:17.120
 Universe or the pure land. Third is invoking the blessings of the western beings.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:31.040
 And fourth is merging of the stabilized. And fifth is making offerings and praise, praise,

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:42.720
 praise. And sixth is or fifth is then reactivating of the of the stabilizing of the entire

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:43.440
 meditation.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:52.800
 Stabilizing entire meditation. So those are the five or six soft highlight of the

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:02.480
 yoga of the body divine body meditations. Now the first one, that is foundation.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.880
 That foundation is three samadhis. And many of you all know.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:23.840
 Many of you know three samadhis and that is again our say and satyanesa samadhi. And all

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:42.560
 arises samadhi and ebonical samadhis. Awesome. And also in this way what it is called.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.760
 And if you maybe just write this.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:21.840
 I am. And the second is.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:39.840
 kunda nama k-u-n-t-u kunda nama n-a-n-g-w-l-a-w-a-i

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:48.960
 nama tangenji. Same thing. The first one same thing. And the third is jyutangenji.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:05:06.560
 J-u. And maybe i. jyutangenji. And the first is devini tangenji. I translated

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:17.040
 satyanesa meditation. Devini is satyanesa. All the true nature. Satyanesa. And then

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:24.000
 this is. Second kunda nama tangenji. I translated all arising.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:33.600
 Arising samadhi or the meditation. And the third I translated. I think that may be same.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:45.440
 Causal or the sit samadhis. Causal or sit samadhis. So that is that three. Now these three are.

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:54.320
 What is this three actually? Look this is not something anyone else. Actually this three

00:05:54.320 --> 00:06:01.840
 is really explaining the garlic of our awareness of the Buddha nature. This is our Buddha nature.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:10.800
 This Buddha nature is satyanesa. Buddha nature is all arising. Buddha nature is cause.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:22.800
 Cause of what? Everything. That is what really it is. So it's not something that outside we bring

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:28.000
 or this this and that. So that means when we practice of this three samadhi we touch into

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:34.400
 our heart, our nature, our goal, goal of the beings. I think sometimes they call it.

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:43.440
 Cold being you touch. Really touch. That is what is all. And now this this this

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:53.680
 this first satyanesa. What is this satyanesa? Satyanesa is a true natural

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.600
 in a Dokkitic doctrine measured pure from the beginning.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.960
 Exactly if you follow in Dokkitic it is tachung. Tachung. Pure from beginning,

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:20.720
 free from any aspects or any any publications, exactly as it is as like space as spaces.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:30.080
 Total pure. Total open. Totally inexpressible. Or as the other day we're talking about the

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:35.120
 the Heart Sutras at the beginning of Heart Sutras. Unborn, unceasing,

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:43.200
 naturally by sky. Sky like nature. Nature. That is what this satyanesa is.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:50.880
 And generally all these natures are in that status. This is not something only that our

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:57.040
 buddha nature. Everything is because a cold and inner thunder teaching everything is the

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:02.560
 display of this buddha nature. So exactly what buddha nature has that also everything display has.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:10.400
 Everyone in display it has that. Everything has that. It's not something only that. So the

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:19.120
 everything is unborn, unceasing and naturally the sky if you look careful. Careful. It is that is

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:25.760
 what the integration teacher, Buddha, is saying is absolute truth. Why is it called absolute truth?

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:33.440
 Because we can understand immediately. For us it's in a way hiding. It's natural. Hiding.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:40.000
 This hiding is not just somebody hiding us because due to our knowledge in Heart Sutras

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:50.080
 it's naturally hiding. Naturally hidden. That reason is known as absolute truth. Reality level

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:55.440
 as I said earlier in the Buddha said too palm is emptiness and there is a palm right there.

00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:05.040
 It's the same. It's no difference. Difference. So this is known as the satyanesa samadha.

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:12.380
 A coat. This is what we are touching too hard. And this is also known as no other than the dharmak

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:12.560
aya.

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:21.750
 This is dharmakaya service. And that is dharmakaya is a result. When we practice and meditate then

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:21.840
 we

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:28.240
 go reaching dharmakaya or dharmakaya service. It is something that our we're keeping up discover

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:34.960
 but while we are maintaining this that satyana still that time we are already in a dharmakaya

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:41.600
 service. That's how the beauty and the power of the vedayan teaching or the another teaching.

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:45.040
 Really according to the teaching that is really dharmakaya.

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:53.520
 And also in the teaching say when in vedayan teaching what it does when you relax in that

00:09:53.520 --> 00:10:01.360
 state it will purify the habit pattern habit pattern particularly that habit patterns.

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:11.360
 When we go through lives what do we call they are called? Death and death and a pardon and birth.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:19.200
 These three big kind of stages even though each of those has large variety kind of sovereignty or

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:30.080
 aspects but three things. This satyanesa meditation will purify habit patterns of death.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:35.440
 Touching to the dharmakaya realization or bring out the realization of dharmakaya.

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:40.480
 That's the way the nature. And this is also as in the dharmakaya teaching

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:46.800
 it is to practice. Or in mahamadhar this is the mahamadhar. You're relaxing in the

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:51.520
 mahamadhar status. Status. That is what it is.

00:10:54.960 --> 00:11:00.470
 So therefore for example I'm not talking a little bit more kind of these things that are

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:00.640
 highlighted

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:07.280
 in detail. But then when you practice this again in all of that we have time do this kind of like

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:14.960
 begin here what I said here. Sit here or I really have to say something again here.

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:20.960
 This is the kind of organized this kind of quickly this sadhana and the thought of help

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:27.760
 and the dharmakaya and dharmakaya they checked. But again this is my fault. This is not their fault

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:27.760
.

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:34.000
 But it's missing here one service. And the visualization of the madhana we have to add

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:43.760
 home. H-U-N-G home. And because this is also not complete my because I didn't mistake

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:50.320
 because we follow the root dharma teaching of the satsang moonpa. In the root dharma teacher

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:55.760
 congrats on the dharma teaching of the satsang moonpa of this sadhana don't have the home.

00:11:55.760 --> 00:12:03.680
 So I didn't add. But then yesterday in which I named it's already confused. Something's missing.

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:12.000
 I thought really it needs something here home. And everyone has something but these don't have

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.840
 anything and it's secure. So I thought I checked that the deep largest happening of the satsang

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:18.160
 moonpa

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:25.520
 this day my teaching and it has home. Home. So therefore I think I'm not making

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:30.800
 publicating things or making up things myself. So I think it is really a teaching of the

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:40.720
 Guru Mooji. So I think we can add here home. Page 10. Page 10. Page 10 is the beginning

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:48.000
 we get a vision of the mandala. And we are what we started from emptiness appears that that here

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:57.040
 here we put a we put a home from the emptiness appears the dark blue a that's what we put.

00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:09.360
 So that's that's it. So that home now if you have time for example and you ask what I'm talking

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:15.040
 about the last short time it is Satchinist meditation it's Satchinist meditation is not

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:20.960
 other than the Tukkoo meditation or Mohammedan meditation. So relax that's really the short time

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:29.120
 can we hear the mind for example that. So that is really about the all Satchinist samadhi.

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:34.720
 Samadhi that's it. So samadhi samadhi is the cross centrality or meditations meditations.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:45.440
 And the next one is all kundanam things in it a bit and I translated it all arising samadhi

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:53.520
 or manifest like samadhi all arising all arising samadhi. So that is the word. Now that is is what

00:13:53.520 --> 00:14:03.760
 is that? That all arises samadhi is is that Satchinist. Satchinist is not blank status

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:11.600
 not empty blank empty status. It is filled with the qualities.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:21.600
 Call it or the sitalin qualities. All the richness everything really every richness

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:30.240
 is filled with that Satchinist even though we can't detect it. We cannot find it but it's

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:38.640
 blended in completely. That we are that is a many times teaching known as a clarity.

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:48.400
 In the Dzogchi teaching is the clarity luminous. Or in the Dzogchi teaching it is a toga display

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:55.600
 of the hidden treasures. Hidden treasures right there right here right with our nature of the

00:14:55.600 --> 00:15:04.400
 mind. And that we can see for example all our thoughts are coming. Where is coming?

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:13.120
 Of course we take mind but where from mind? Where? There's no any place from the source of the

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:20.160
 unborn arising everything. For that reason Varangarh Gavarjike said that from the unborn

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:26.480
 state everything is born taking birth. Unborn states. Have you looked at the source and

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:32.960
 everyone's getting analyzed. Even modern machinery always get analyzed. I don't see you will find

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:41.200
 the source. But that is here. Obviously. All our emotions here. Where did it come from?

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:52.240
 There's no shortage of emotions. Really rich. And all our brutal motivations. Love, kindness,

00:15:52.240 --> 00:16:00.560
 compassion. There's also no shortage. Here is only this richness state of sadness of the true

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:01.200
 nature

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:10.240
 of the mind. That is. But this time that richness we're going to visualize as great compassion.

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:19.200
 Compassion is right there. So now arise great compassion. Power of compassion and energy as

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:27.920
 morning sunlight and clay sky. Bright up. Clay everything. Just luminosity everything.

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:37.520
 Same way that great compassion. Without any judgmental. Without any kind of distinct

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:43.600
 or discomfort this and that. Just pervasive compassion. Unconditional compassion.

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:54.000
 And unpartiality compassion. Prevent every delicacy. And that compassion just comes

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:00.880
 in peaceful, soothing, calming and relaxing in that state that we have time again for a moment.

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:12.160
 That is known as all arising samadhis. You are activating our hidden treasures. The treasures.

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:22.320
 True treasures. And what it does, they call it tiki. It purifies the habit dependence of the bardo.

00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:30.720
 Bardo habit dependence. And what is that nature is? It's no other than the sambhukha.

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:39.840
 Sambhukha we heard often in the teaching is so rich. Sambhukha is a luxurious. That's what

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:45.920
 name sounds like a word. Just enjoyment with everything. Every luxurious there's nothing is

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:53.380
 missing. Nothing is a shortage. That's what really sounds like. So our clarity, the nature of

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:53.920
 beauty,

00:17:53.920 --> 00:18:03.120
 we call it richness, it's no shortage. We're revealing that richness. Relax with compassion.

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:10.960
 To all, to every direction. You had all the beings of six and not necessarily you were you like the

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:18.800
 beings but just went everywhere. Completely saturated. Completely luminous. Luminated.

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:31.440
 Compassion. That is known as the all arising samadhis. Samadhis. Now the combination of the

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:41.760
 exogenous samadhi, all arising samadhi combination then appear instantly appeared. Home syllabus.

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:55.280
 So home syllabus is active, active energy of the certainness and compassion. Or in other

00:18:55.280 --> 00:19:03.680
 words the certainness is also known as, another name known as wisdom, primordial wisdom. All the

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:11.600
 fundamental certainness is. And the compassion, union of the wisdom and the compassion evade

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:19.680
 magically home syllabus. That home syllabus is an individual more than as you and you. I mean that

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:19.760
's

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:24.690
 how I pronounce it. Or you can do any or you can do any individual to you. I mean it's just either

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:24.880
 way.

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:37.840
 But now home syllable is, is, is the essence or the of the wisdom of the certainness

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:45.920
 and compassion a big form of in this time home syllabus. And then other sadhana's it depends

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:51.520
 whatever the sixth syllable of their goodness. Could be de-syllable, dumb syllables, or whatever

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:57.200
 three syllables of that. But follow this sadhana that is so important. They call it instruction.

00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:02.800
 And instruction it has reason as I said the other day. Buddha never goes to us.

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:09.920
 Gurbim masala never goes to us. Who makes stories. Exhale things they did. So keep that.

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:19.920
 That's sixth syllable. And this why this sixth syllable is what it does. It also purifies

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:30.560
 the happiness of the birth. Birth. This is now also it is our consciousness, our awareness.

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:38.320
 And this consciousness our awareness is going to the birth. Birth. It is consciousness.

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:42.960
 And this sign birth of high agreement in the video arrives.

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:49.600
 And then this also from the syllable all the displays arising.

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:56.400
 If this is sixth syllable it's also known as namakayas. From this everything is going to emanate.

00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:06.400
 Purely. D-E-T. And all the usages that everything is a disability from the home syllabus.

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:12.080
 Everything. Therefore it is also known as seat samadas.

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:20.160
 Seat. Or sometimes I think that's related to people say causal samadas. So that is one.

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:28.160
 Also every year time for example you now magically build home syllabus. This time home

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:35.600
 syllable, home sixth syllable is dark red. Dark red color. From that not just sixth syllable.

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:42.880
 Home appeared. From that seat home syllable came so many light, powerful light. This light is also

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:49.360
 not just a light light. It is love. It is a compassion. It is a wisdom. It is a power of

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:55.200
 the buddhas. That is when higher giving and whatever. When all the different pure lengths

00:21:55.200 --> 00:22:02.160
 and five higher pure lengths or the ten buddhas pure length of the ten directions of the buddhas.

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:08.640
 When making big offerings to a contact with them give that to all offerings. In particular the

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:14.660
 pure length of the buddha amita. To jares. To amita. To higher giving. And living higher giving.

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:14.880
 Living

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:20.960
 very well. Peaceful and beautiful and peaceful. Radha and beautiful and beautiful and similar.

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:27.680
 And all the sattara, jishinsodya, undharava. I mean all the nakittis it really made such an

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:36.880
 effect. That moment. So many again blessings of light sent by buddha. True true return to us.

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:44.800
 Or true home syllable as empowered glorified. Home is not just a single isolated home here.

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:52.880
 What I give is all buddhas. Everyone is aware of this and they're all empowered and blessed.

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:59.360
 And that moment home become even more powerful. More majestic. More dignity. More strong.

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:09.360
 And emanated. So many again slightest. White, red, blue, green. Green and yellow and multiple

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:15.840
 light emanated. Went to all the beings for six rims. Everyone. It touched every single living

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:19.440
 being. Removed their suffering in difficult trouble. Whatever they're going through.

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:27.440
 And discover their inner qualities for the buddha nature. And everything become now all buddha and

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:34.160
 buildings. And they returned the home. So they returned the light back to the home syllable.

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:44.800
 They observed. Observed. That moment then from the home syllable came so many again syllables. I

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:44.960
 mean

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:52.240
 they didn't say it here but all the different syllables and created all the elements. Sky, fire,

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:59.280
 water, wind, earth, and the mountains, structure, landscapes, and paras. Everything is created

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:05.360
 magically from that. Because this short southern didn't make it. So I won't go all these things

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:12.880
 and just take time. But all that created. All that appeared. So that means that the whole universe

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:18.560
 paras, pure land, is nothing but is loving kindness, complete universe, that display.

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:24.000
 No matter even the fire, water, wind. And the reality of those all elements of fire, water,

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:29.680
 wind, is the five female buddhas or display of five female buddhas. All that thing.

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:38.160
 Everything here. And then instead there is also paras in there. And paras is what? Here.

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:48.640
 Here. And then here is it. From that uncontracted paras of the great, part one,

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:56.240
 serpentine epic. How that is? That is already here. So proportions and all that. Even though

00:24:56.240 --> 00:25:03.920
 the ability these forms and all these things, the reality really is wisdom, the compassion,

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:09.200
 and the loving kindness, and the power of that. That's it. That ability all different forms.

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:18.080
 On the other world, all is enlightened status. All the forms is enlightened. All the songs are

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:24.240
 enlightened. And all the space in the mind is enlightened. Nothing is not enlightened.

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:32.800
 So that is what. And then we come back in that moment. Then instantly each of us become

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:40.640
 very high giver and very wide. So that means home syllable. From that home syllable,

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:49.680
 instantly the period. Our song. Perfect. Very high giver and very wide eyes.

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:57.600
 High giver. And that is standing on the right as in the teaching said. You said here,

00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:14.320
 lotus, sun, and moon, and cups. Exactly that. So that is my brief talk for today. If you have some

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:20.400
 questions, I'm happy to discuss short time. Otherwise, it's very, very bad.
