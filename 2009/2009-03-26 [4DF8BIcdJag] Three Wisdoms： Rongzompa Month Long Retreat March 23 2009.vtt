00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.490
 For example, in Azoki teaching, that is what we all are meditating, that awareness and emptiness,

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:15.000
 awareness and emptiness is what the teacher said, what you read in the text, only in the books.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 And now you are going to put that in your, because your intelligence, if it's true or not.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.360
 If there is certain some doubt and hesitations, then your self will encourage that to yourself, or

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:36.000
 discuss with the Sangha members, or to the teachers, discuss that.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.260
 It's true awareness, emptiness, awareness, it is what really they said, that is what we are trying

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.000
 to meditate, but it's true or not.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:54.250
 I am trying to bring that, that meaning, meaning, that into heart or in the mind with the certainty

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.000
, the wisdom, that then, then you don't have any doubt afterwards.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.500
 When you don't have the doubt and hesitation, when you develop that confidence, then, then you go

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.000
 forward.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.090
 And then on the party, when there is some doubt and hesitation comes, that is obstacle, that is

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.000
 hindrance, that is interference of the emotions,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.120
 negilivities or the duality, then we shouldn't go on that side tracks, continually maintain what

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.000
 you already developed, great certainty, wisdom and confidence,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.500
 of such as, like, awareness, emptiness, stiffness. And that is the knowledge then, the emptiness,

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.000
 awareness, oh, sorry, that is the knowledge then, the certainty or the contemplation, the wisdom.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 (Tibetan)

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.770
 Now, in these three wisdoms, now most wisdom is this wisdom that comes from the study, that you

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.000
 went through books of, you studied.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:45.570
 Through that wisdom, you kind of understand the meanings of the words, languages, all that kind of,

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.000
 you understand, that meanings, see.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.920
 And then, second wisdom is the kind of process of the inquiry, to the meaning of that, what you

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:04.000
 studied. You really went through that, through that, through that, so you analyzed that.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.700
 And now these two are very, very special and important. But if you just leave there, then you

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.000
 become maybe good scholars, good scholars.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.270
 That's nothing but scholars. For example, then, like, you become nice, like, in a, in a, what's

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:27.000
 called, inner sciences, you become a good psychiatrist, good psychiatrist, good psychiatrist.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:36.190
 But that is not the only, that's the point in the Buddha's teacher. After that, then, third wisdom

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:44.000
 has to be applied. That is known as the wisdom, meditation or the practice of wisdom.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.990
 The wisdom that comes from the practice and the meditation. If you didn't do this third one, then

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:57.000
 that is known as called, the knowledge is become, or mainly, ideas.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.100
 Or the wisdom becomes ideas. Or mainly, knowledge, that, or knowledge or the wisdom, the meaning,

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.000
 you left on the books or the shelters, shelters.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.740
 It's not really observing in your heart and mind. What it is observing in your heart and mind, to

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:19.500
 improve your self, man your self, and that what you studied, is the practice, practice in

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.000
 meditation.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:28.790
 Meditation or practice? Meditation is practice. Practice is practices, practices. In many other

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.000
 Buddhism generally, practice, we're joining, is meditation.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:42.190
 Reciting is meditation. In silence is meditation, meditation. All, all is meditation practices. It

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:47.000
's not just, it's joining and reciting, it's kind of outside of meditation.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:54.130
 That you all know, the whole process. Everything is within that practice of status or meditative

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:55.000
 status.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:03.830
 And therefore, with that, then it began to, your self become what you, our self become, what we

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.000
 studied, what we learned.
