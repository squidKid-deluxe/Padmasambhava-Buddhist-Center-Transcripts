00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.070
 We have been looking back to our lives, how many beautiful things we have, and also how many

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.000
 challenging things happen in our lives.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.690
 At this time, we have quite a good everything. Looking to the every direction, solemnly to ask, we

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.000
 are quite blessed.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.530
 All these beautiful things. Many different levels, both spiritual level or Dharma level, and as

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.000
 well as in samsara,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 worldly levels, we are quite good. Looking to around the world, we need all these different things.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:45.450
 To look to us, how good things we are, how blessed, how we are fortunate, how are we beautiful

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.000
 things.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 So therefore, as I always said, and it is not something that I say you don't know,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 always we need to study joy and appreciation, thankful, grateful, being grateful.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 These all are foundation of the Buddha teaching, our practice. What are we going to learn?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 There is no Buddha Dharma beside those things. Joy and appreciation, respect.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 Respect to yourself, respect to others, being graceful, grateful. They appreciate, glorify.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:36.450
 We don't do those things. Our life will be very convoluted, slim, dark, and everything is not

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.000
 correct.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 These and that things go on and on. It's true, sometimes it all goes on and on.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:51.730
 But we are practicing this. We have to, restenstance, bounce back to our nature, our own nature of

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:53.000
 the mind.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 Bring joy and appreciation. Through the joy and appreciation, understand the meaning of our nature

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 and Dharma,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.490
 we are going to transcend all those difficult things into the path, into the learning, into the

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:09.000
 experience.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 Restenstance will find our courage and commitment and understanding.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 Are we able to do that? If we do that, that is known as in the Buddha teaching practitioners.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 That is known as in Buddha teaching, bodhisattvas, warriors of all the enlightenment.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 Warriors for the enlightenment to our self, warriors for the enlightenment to the others.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 We are not just only self-conscious, like centered mind, being practiced in Bodhadhana.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 We have to also think of others. We act what's called as the wise man's insight.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 Also, we know that. You know that. So look. Act locally, think globally.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 Think globally, act locally. That's the very wise and the prettiest statements.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.600
 That's what we have to do. Think locally. We have to restenstance our self. What are the benefits

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.000
 to others?

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.500
 We make ourselves strong and good with joy, with appreciation, with calm, with peaceful, more

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.000
 relaxed,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 more open-hearted mind, and then try to help others according to our readiness and capabilities.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 Start with our family members, our friends, our neighbors, as much as you can do.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.220
 It's not something that we have to do the authentic things, the authentic things immediately to

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.000
 help.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 Do your capability. Move with the best, the best, the best. More practical.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 But every time, bring joy and appreciation and glorify.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 Acknowledge to yourself. Have you done something good? Really, it feels good.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 It should be happy and joy. I did one of the things. I did good. I will do tomorrow even better

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 next time.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 By the blessings of the Buddhas, in the morning south of all the enlightened things.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 Thinking of that, moving forward, that is known as practitioners in Buddhism, practicing dharma.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.540
 Practicing dharma is not this kind of self-important, or I'm the spirit, I'm this, this, that, that

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:16.000
 things.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 And others don't. Practice means bring more beauty, gentle nature, calm and peaceful.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 So to start with that, joy and appreciation is number one, and bring gracefully.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 We need to agree with that. Then bring, as I said many times, and you know, we all been practicing,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 we heard this from our great master thinking for the children many times, then devotions.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 Joy and appreciation and devotions. Devotions to all these lineage masters, Buddha, bodhisattva.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 How, when you look to them in their teaching, in their life first, how much their heart

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 and every activity is filled with love, with compassion, with kindness, with patience,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 with tolerance, tolerance and thinking, helping to all living beings.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 Even they, they take others more important themselves. That's the truth.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 That's what the Buddha did when we read life stories, and when we read his teachings.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:26.320
 And all those great masters went one after another, and they stood towards them 500 years in Yurid

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.000
ata.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 How many great beings came to bring peace and harmony?

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 To all mankind, all living beings, not just only one group is that.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 Their love and compassion and wisdom is pervasive as the sunlight in the sky.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.000
 Sun has no partialities. Wherever the opportunity, wherever the circumstances arise,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 the sun shines gloriously, beautifully, and dispels the darkness of all the colors.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
 Similarly, these great masters did that.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 Love and compassion are abrasives to every living and graceful.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 Same time, humble and simple, down to the earth.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 Earth, that is what our role models, that is what we should learn.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 And wherever we should meet, more, more how precious, how beautiful it is.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 And for more emotions. The emotions are nothing but more feeling of depression,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 importance, and respect, and observing that wallet to our heart,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 and our mind's stem, so that we will become as that we call it.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 Really, truly, we become that one of the beacon of the world.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 It's a peace and harmony, joy, and then difficulty.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 Whatever they bring, we remove those old things by that our wishes.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 That is the thought. We have that even intentions in the Buddha teaching said.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 How much powerful, every sincere thing in our heart,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000
 which all living beings are happy in joy, free from trouble, and bring peace.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 And if you think that even one moment,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 Buddha actually said so many times, he cannot even measure the power and merit of that colors.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 That, where that comes from, all that beautiful things.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 It's nothing but our own mind, from our mind, from your mind, from my mind.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 This is what it means.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 So therefore, promote joy and devotion, respect and devotion.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 Devotion is, as I said, appreciate, appreciate the feeling and respect, respect.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 And same time, also this nugget of devotion goes one right side to yourself.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 I have more devotees to yourself.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 How I'm going to make, how precious it is, how important, like this it is.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 I'm going to, not going, where's this?

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 This, I'm going to make meaningful of this.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 This, really think of that and feel preciousness of this things.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
 This is what in many times we call basic things, basic.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
 But basics are the central column of the practice of Dharma.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 If we lost the basic, we lost the ground.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 We lost the ground, truly.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 I'm not talking that story.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 It's true.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 If we don't have the basic foundation of this joy and appreciate, devotion and bodhicitta,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 we lost the ground.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
 We are lingering on the space.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 We won't go far.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 But if we rooted strongly on the ground, what I'm discussing,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 the joy and appreciation, devotions, and then bodhicitta.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 And bodhicitta you all know.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 Love and compassion and wisdom.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 Combined target, that precious attitude of the mind,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 come target as one single state, as bodhicitta.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.000
 Love to all living beings, compassion for all living beings,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000
 understanding exactly where things are, combined target.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000
 These three qualities are known, combined target, not as bodhicitta.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 Many of you know what bodhicitta means.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 It starts to work, bodhicitta.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:20.000
 But if we just let it into finish, mind of enlightenment.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 Mind of enlightenment.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
 Enlightenment not just comes with approval.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 Our enlightenment begins right now.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
 Whenever you have the love and the compassion,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 understanding of the exactly where things are,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 we begin, we are candle the light of the enlightenment.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 We light up.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 It's not just dark. We really light that.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 Where is that?

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 In our nature of the mind, in our heart center.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 Love and compassion and wisdom is lighting up.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 The enlightened begin like that moment.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
 There are possible footsteps of the total enlightenment.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
 It begins right with that moment.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
 Therefore, it is called enlightenment mind.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
 Enlightenment mind.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
 Guru Pei Mahasamma said, also in the teaching,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 said in a great kenki body here in which many times it's of quotations.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 Since these are the prima Buddha minds.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
 Love, loving kind is the Buddha mind.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 Compassion is the Buddha mind.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 And wisdom is Buddha mind.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
 This Buddha mind is right with us.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 Right with you. Right with me.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 How we have to do?

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
 We have to glorify this.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 We have to bring that bright, bright, bright, bright and brightly.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
 And that shines all over the world.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
 All over the space and beyond the space.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 When you become that, that is known as full enlightenment.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
 Full enlightenment, completely enlightened.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 That is right.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:08.000
 But at this time, our love and compassion and wisdom are just light.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 Just Friday light.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 We have to glorify it.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:18.000
 Heart with joy, with devotion, with courage, with commitment.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 That is the whole practice.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 I told you to speak these things because we are just going to put more teachings on the dhara.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
 What is dhara? Again.
