00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 Thank you very much everyone. Shrekha Delish, and welcome everyone. Thank you. Thank you so much.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:23.740
 Again we continue the teachings, the practice on six parabdha, which is the activating the bodhij

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:29.000
ata and bodhijata, the mind of enlightenment.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 That also indicates that we all have mind of the Buddha.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:45.660
 So now we have to activate that, and that is known as the actualizing bodhijata, activating bodhij

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:54.490
ata with the physically, verbally, the performing, engaging, lined up with the bodhijata, and that

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.000
 is the activating bodhijata.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:05.040
 And with that, again to do that, we are going to be activated, re-celerated of our, of the

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:14.990
 motivations, the joy and appreciation, and Vasna's motivation of the bodhijata for all living

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.000
 beings to become their enlightenment,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.770
 and as well as to bring the realization of the body, beyond realization of the body and the

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.000
 teaching, by myself, and as well as all the beings to bring that realization.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.130
 Having that intelligent thought, and for that reason, I'm going to reflect the teachings, the

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.480
 greatest teachings of the bodhijata community, known as the teachings of the protonal teaching, and

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.000
 vastness teachings.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 So this is a little bit known as sabbatthi-jajevichu, and I'm going to reflect that.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 I'm going to listen, I'm going to analyze, and I'm going to absorb that into my heart as practices,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 I'm going to be meaningful, meaningful of that.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:12.380
 So I'm going to become myself as a dharma, mandali dharma, with me, not dharma and myself separated

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.000
 through different places.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 Observe the teaching into the heart, activating that.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:30.400
 Having those beautiful intelligent thought, in order to become that, may Buddha, bodhisattva, Gaur

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.760
abhima, sambhava, all the lineage Mahasam, please bless me there, so I can actualize that

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:33.000
 realization.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 Exactly you all got realization.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 Having those beautiful intelligent thought, and then we follow, again, the teaching.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 The teaching, particularly the sound, we follow the teachings of the Japri Dunyurungu teachings

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 that will go on that frame, teaching.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 And which is known as, then, the heart-advised to 14 students.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:05.980
 That is Japri Dunyurungu, this teaching, maybe 50 years ago, but this teaching is true for all of

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.000
 us, the 14th, all the 14th ones.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 It means everyone, we all are 14th.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 We went through many different ways that went through when we were discussing about Paul, Reynolds,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 and Tho, and so we really discussed.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 We are all 14th, 14th practitioners. We are 14th.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 We have such a wonderful opportunity, wonderful sambhavas, wonderful conditions.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 We are sovereign, and we have already been 14th.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:47.260
 Born with 14th children, with a clear, instantic mind, and very thoughtful, and spiritually

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.000
 oriented thoughts.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 Not just only ourselves, we are thinking, thinking about other beings.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 Those who are all known in the sign of the realization.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 Those who are the seedling signs of the realization of enlightenment is booming up, really true.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 It's just true.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 Coming to vapors, like spring water, we all have that.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 But this is not just only enough to have that.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 This can be, again, damaged and interrupted by the myth of the chaos in the samsara situation.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.080
 There we go every day through that challenges, and therefore it can be really so done and

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.000
 interrupted.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 For that reason, we need practice. That is all about it.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 Practice, as known as practice makes perfect. It really will bring the perfection status.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:43.170
 Continually, so we move forward, steady, steadfast, we move forward, and then it will bring the

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:44.000
 realization.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 So, with those understanding, and now we go with these teachings.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:55.790
 Any teachings that we can do now, which kind of is to go to the point that we are, you kind of lay

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:57.000
 out,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 as following the teachings of the kumkibai and other ningman masters,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:10.070
 or the practice, master of the practice, lineage, the beginning good, middle good, and kumkulure

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:11.000
 good.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 We are now in the middle good.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 Middle good is the principle part of the practices.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 Middle good is also not just a kind of middle good.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 I don't need any other of those, beginning good and ending good.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 Always we combine. All of these three are so important.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 It really makes it perfect, completely perfect. It makes total practices.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 It's not incomplete. It will every have these three.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 So, every time this motivation, the joy and the appreciation, precious attitude,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 the feeling of these four renounce as your thought, reference, both each other, and the devotions.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 Those are known as beginning good, but always we should have that.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 As much as we can. Even during the middle, the middle of the years,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 intensive practices such as repetition, or the visualization, or the dzokti meditation,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 or Mohammedan meditation, occasionally bring up those beautiful thoughts.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 For first minutes, or for second. It's so powerful, so important.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 And the teachings say it. All the masters always say it.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 When you do those, reflect the thought, it will freshen up your practices.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 It will freshen up your concentrations. It will freshen up your devotions.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
 It will freshen up, stabilize the meditation.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 Bring more clarity, more crispy clarity in the meditation.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 Not dull, soggy, looks like almost going to sink to the earth, to the end of the earth.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 No, it's brightness, it really brings up those.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 It's always there, so it's kind of fresh up, reactivated that.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 And so those are really so important.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 And therefore, even during the middle of the practice, middle of the or the principal practices.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:11.000
 Principal practices is that then, as we discuss it, or follow in the teachings of Lom Kimpa,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 middle good, middle good. And that is then, particularly, actualizing both each other's.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 Acculizing both each other, the whole practice is now the actualizing both each other.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 And the both each other is when you collide, then it summarizes into six paramata practices.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 That is more kind of leveraged, highlighted, the intensifying of the quality of the both each other

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:37.000
's,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 or practice of the both each other.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 As we discussed yesterday, and you know already, the practice of both each other,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 we need courage, and commitment, and confidence.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:56.000
 These six paramata practices are so powerful.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 It's well removed, or purified, the mundane habit of the samsara.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:12.080
 It clearly that, and bring up the perfect meaning of the lives, meaning of the time, meaning of the

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.000
 situations.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.520
 Finally, it will bring the realization of the Buddha's hope, order to benefit for all sensitive

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:20.000
 beings.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 So therefore, courage and commitment is so important.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:33.530
 With that, have that, bring us both in circles, the bravery, put enlightenment, have that kind of

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:37.000
 bring up that, is then this both six paramatas.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 In order to do these paramata practices, also we need courage.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:49.120
 We have to be brave, generous practices, morality practices, patient practices, all the other param

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:52.000
ata practices, we need bravery.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 We need, we bring up our healing, worship, call it, really bring up that, call it.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:07.000
 With openness, with relaxed, with smart, with practical.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:14.540
 So that means, for the worship practice, the six paramata, or the five paramata, is solely guided

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:17.000
 by six paramata wisdom.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 Wisdom paramata is guided every other paramata practices.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 Wisdom is like eyes in the teaching state, eyes of the five paramatas.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 Wisdom is eye of the generous paramata.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000
 Wisdom is eye of the morality paramatas.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 And wisdom is eye of the patient paramatas, and so forth.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 That is, that means, combined target.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 That means, it's completely guided, perfectly, really practical, very affectful,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 to bring practice, that benefit to my own self, but also for other beings.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 Because the solely purpose of the body together is to benefit for others.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 That's what we know, that's what we've heard, that's what we've taught, learned.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 So therefore, it is true, have those smart.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
 And with this, and now we talk, without those understanding, again,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:29.000
 now we go over the topic, what we started yesterday, which is third paramata, the patient paramatas

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:29.000
,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 which is a chant paramatas.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 Chant paramata is the most powerful paramata, again.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 As the teaching said, for example, the other one is so powerful, so speaker.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 But the morality, the second paramata, is more powerful than the generous paramata.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:58.000
 And more profound, more deeper, more powerful, morality paramata.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 And morality paramata, to compare with the moral paramata and the patient paramata,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 the patient paramata is more deeper, more stronger, more effective, more powerful.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 It is deeper.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 And that's how the teaching goes.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 Generacy is so important, so special.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
 But morality is more deeper than the generous.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 And morality is, again, so special, beautiful.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:33.000
 It is a foundation for all the practices, but the patient paramata is so powerful, strong.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 Of course, if we had the patient paramatas,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:44.000
 our morality paramata would become so strong, so good, not fragile, not timid.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:50.000
 Not kind of weak, weak, kind of feeble status, really met strong.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
 So that is the patient paramata is so important.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000
 Now, the patient paramata, again, is one.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 The nature of the patient paramata, I may have already in the teaching said, is not disturbed.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000
 Not disturbed, of the attitude of not disturbed.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:17.000
 That is the nature of the patient paramatas.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 That also indicates in the samsara, where we are, there are so many challenges,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 so many kind of situations, circumstances that come up.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 And we can be disturbed, but we strongly, standing firmly,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 strongly our principle of the body together.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
 Then it won't disturb, to disturb.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
 Maybe it will disturb you for a short moment or two seconds,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 but if we catch up with the wisdom of the mindfulness,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:54.000
 we will reach a point back to our put, where we are standing, firmly standing.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 We can stand tall in the frame and the storms.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 So therefore, it is not disturbed.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
 But nature or the identity, maybe I can say,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 to the nature of the patient paramata is not disturbed.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 Not disturbed.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
 And in the teaching said, use the example,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
 strong and solid as the mountains.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 No matter whatever the situation or circumstances,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
 the change mostly remains as mode.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000
 Whether it is raining, whether it is sunny, whether it is winter,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:37.000
 whether it is summer, the whole time remains strong.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 That is, and not losing the identity of the body together.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 Body together, again, if we go back to the work again,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 where the patient is the best, is in body together.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
 We talk that vision, body together as poor, boundless.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 So patient is standing firmly on the poor, boundless.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 Poor, boundless for all the sentient beings.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 That's what we discuss.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:10.000
 Now, we talk anyway then, we discuss the vision, body together.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:19.000
 One, the tunguni practices, samplitutta or equalizing, exchanging,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:25.000
 others are more important than one's own self.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 Those are wishing, body together.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
 When we do thinking of those thought,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 it's known as in the teaching, mentally exercising.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
 Now, not just a mental exercising,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 when you come to the sex environment,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000
 you're actually, we are physically, verbally,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 we are engaging in that, say, our philosophy, principles,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:57.000
 in the action, in the society, in social events,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:04.000
 or in the groups, with others.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 That is what we really are. Now, you're really putting that in exercise.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000
 Those, that's poor, boundless, and tunguni practices,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:22.000
 or those dagi nyamba, dagi jyaba, and dagi jenji in a debate.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 We are putting exercise.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 So to do this, this patient is one of the very, very powerful.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 We can handle and stand firmly with that,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.000
 and not like the dawn of us, from our passages,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 or our path, path.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
 Then that is the dawn of the great principle,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
 symbol of the good practitioners.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 And this is what, again, in the tunguni practices,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 or this is what we discussed all day.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.000
 Ancient, all those great masters, really, in a sense,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:05.000
 joy, articha, came into debate. This practice becomes so powerful in debate,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000
 such as, like, thirty-seven practices, the bodhisattvas,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
 we must have started. You read those teachings.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 And at first, of loudly tungkas, those are not just the same words,

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
 those are practices.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:28.000
 Those are the practices of this bodhijata, or the sixth part of the practices.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
 In Ilan, I thought, what is teaching?

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
 What I didn't teach, I said, one of the...

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 This is a really nice story.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 I mean, it's not just a story, but it's a true story.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000
 In the teachings, see, there are only eleven centuries.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 There is a master known as Chekhov.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
 He is very learned.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 He knows all the three bhikka teachings, three bhikka teachings,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000
 as well as his started logics, and he is very well established.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 It's scholars.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 One time, he came to see Sharapat, Sharapat, his kind of friend,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
 I think, classmate of friend, and came to see him.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000
 And he is very also, that his friend and teacher is very famous.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
 Some of the students, disciples, he's teaching.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.000
 And so, he was this kind of, like, helping to the many disciples and all that.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000
 And so, he came to visit, and he's on the pillow.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 His friend's pillow does teaching.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 Below, there's a book, a book with volumes.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
 And when he went out, he just took that book and opened it.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 In that book, that, we do kind of very powerful works

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.000
 of the Downwind Thumpers teaching, known as Adverses.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 Adverses is not standard, Adverses.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 And two of those, what he saw, he kind of stuck to his mind, really, sort of.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:05.000
 He said, "Give the victory, gain and the victory to the others."

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 "Give the gain and the victory to the others."

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 "And take the lose and defeat to yourself."

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.000
 "Loses and defeat, take to you, one's own self."

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.000
 "Offer or gain the gain and the victory to the others."

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000
 He saw that. It really stretched to his mind.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 It stretched to his mind.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 When his friend returned back to his, like, heaven.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000
 He was the famous teacher.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000
 He asked him, "Who did this teaching?"

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
 "But what is this?"

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000
 "This is what he told."

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000
 "It's a very famous teaching of the Downwind Thumpers."

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 "Thumpers."

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
 His soul is so spiritual, so powerful.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
 How can you see that?

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000
 Who had this more explanation and teachings?

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000
 He said the Downwind Thumpers himself had this teaching.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:06.000
 So really, he decided to go to see Downwind Thumpers.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.000
 Downwind Thumpers.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000
 So on the way, coming to the Downwind Thumpers,

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.000
 I think Downwind Thumpers is in a standard way, a long thing.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 Downwind Thumpers is a great master named after a place where he stays.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.000
 Downwind Thumpers.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 But Eddie is a name called Long Thump, I think.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
 And so he came there to see.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000
 But on the way, he stopped on the last afternoon at the Serkum Ambullet.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 He had gone to the Ambullet for two days.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000
 So when he was doing the Serkum Ambullet, he met one man.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 Man, he asked, "Where you came?"

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 He said, "I came from London."

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 "Oh, so you must have saw Long Thumpers."

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000
 He said, "Yes, I saw that."

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 But Long Thumpers, he passed away and turned Mahabharic around.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000
 And he thought, "Oh, so sorry that I'd like to receive more teachings on this."

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.000
 But I saw it.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000
 But who is now there?

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:06.000
 Who is the leading order of these big monasteries of Long Thumpers or the disciples?

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:15.000
 Well, there are two masters. They are kind of like debating or they're having disagreements.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
 Disagreements.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
 And he thought, "Oh, that's really not good."

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:25.000
 "Oh, definitely. If they're not agreeing to each other, that means they don't have the instructions

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
 of this adverse death."

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:37.000
 Because they're arguing, like he can't wait because the man also can't wait like that.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000
 But in reality, it's not really their finding.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:47.000
 In the teaching, he said there are three famous Marx disciples.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 One is the letter "order."

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000
 And the other is the letter "younger."

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000
 The older one is known as "Do-di-ba."

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000
 And the younger one is known as "Shang-jung-ba."

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.000
 And so, "Shang-jung-ba" is, I think, maybe I'm quickly mixed up too.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000
 But "Shang-jung-ba" is more, yeah, older.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:16.000
 "Do-di-ba" is more younger, but "Do-di-ba" is more kind of learned.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000
 And the other is a little more older.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000
 So, "Shang-jung-ba," older student of Long Thumpers said,

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.000
 "Do-di-ba," you should take care of all this congregation or the student

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 because you're more learned.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000
 Then, "Please, you take that."

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:37.000
 And the other is saying, "No, you should take care of all this student and your older,

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000
 and I will respect you as same as my teacher, Long Thumpers.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 So, please, you will take care."

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.000
 And so, they both are having respect to each other,

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000
 and that's why they're really having some disagreement.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000
 It's not they're fighting that who will rule that,

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000
 because they respect that thing, you see.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000
 So, however he didn't understand, "I got that message,"

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000
 he said, "Oh, I'm not going to learn Latin," and so he went.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 And then he asked, "Who had this really, this lineage teaching?"

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.000
 "Please stop him."

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000
 He kind of searching, searching.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000
 And there is a very famous, famous master known as "Shang-jung-ba,"

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:23.000
 which has so many students, potent students, he's teaching.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:28.000
 So, he went there and attended on the, well, he's giving the teaching.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:33.000
 "Shang-jung-ba" is giving teaching, and he listened hopefully this.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 But in the teaching, he never mentioned one word about the adverses, nothing mentioned.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.000
 He thought, "Oh, maybe this Islam teacher don't have that.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000
 Also, this teaching, so I'm not going to stay here for a long time."

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 So, but anyway, one time he thought, at the end of the way he's saying,

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000
 he thought, "I'm going to ask him."

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000
 "Darely, if you have this instruction or not."

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000
 So, through that time, this "sharaba," he's doing "sharaba"

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.000
 on the stupa, the stupa.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:10.000
 So, Cheka himself went there, and he stopped that "sharaba"

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000
 on the way, and he stopped him on the way, and he put the letter.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000
 That 18 times the video can do those things.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 Now those, not custom, like I don't saw.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.000
 But he's also, they're so direct to each other, direct.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.000
 So, he put the small cushion on the ground, asked the teacher,

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000
 "Please sit down on this floor."

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.000
 "Oh, in this cushion, I have one question to ask you."

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:39.000
 And so, this "sharaba" put a stop, and he said that,

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.000
 "What do you have undecided or doubt that not decided?"

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000
 "What question do you have?"

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:51.000
 "I've decided everything, my whole plan, in one sitting on one cushion."

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:55.000
 "One sitting on one cushion, what do you have?"

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.000
 "What do you have that undecided dilemma?"

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000
 "What do you have?"

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.000
 And so, he sat there, and he sat down on the cushion.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.000
 Then "sharaba," sorry, Cheka asked to him.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 I saw this really interesting, beautiful standard teaching,

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000
 teaching, and so he repeated that,

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 "But I'd really like to know more of this."

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000
 "And you have this, how important is, how is this?"

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000
 He said, "Don't make it important, not important."

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000
 "Have you learnt to reach enlightenment?"

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.000
 "Brotherhood, that's the way."

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000
 "If you don't want, then that's it."

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000
 "But otherwise, there's no other alternative than this."

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000
 Then he said, "You have this teaching?"

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000
 "Yes, I have that teaching."

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 "That's my principle practices."

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000
 And then he asked, "Will you give me the instruction?"

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000
 "Did you tell the instructor or repeat the instruction on this teaching?"

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.000
 "Yes, I will give."

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:58.000
 "But if you have found you have to stay long time with me, then I will do."

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:04.000
 So, this Cheka said with him six years in the teaching set.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.000
 Six years, there's entire teachings.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:13.000
 Then Cheka himself become one of the great master of practicing on the Bodhisattvas.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:19.000
 Bodhisattvas, Rhemus, Cheka, that he really got the practice of this,

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000
 versus teaching.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000
 So that is really the teaching of the way.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:29.000
 When you hear these teachings, some of those words, as I said, what I said,

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:36.000
 "Give the gain, gain and the vectority to the others."

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:41.000
 "Take the rules, defeat to yourself."

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:48.000
 That is a great, powerful statement of the Bodhisattva, the complications.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:54.000
 And that is made, they have the most powerful courage and commitment.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:00.000
 Passion, passion, that is what really it is.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:07.000
 So therefore, this passion practice is so important, so special and powerful.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.000
 So now, when we do the vision practice in the teaching set,

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 first you have to think of what is the un-benefit of not doing vision practices.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:26.000
 Or what is the mistakes and errors of not doing the vision practice,

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000
 or not having vision, vision.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000
 Then you should think, what is the benefit of the vision practice?

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.000
 If we do the vision, if we have the vision, I mean, simple I say,

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000
 if you have the vision, what benefit is it?

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 If you don't have vision, what is un-benefit?

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.000
 If you take that, between two that, put it in two bounds, two bounds.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.000
 One is un-vegan, or there is a vision.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:27:01.000
 You think, un-vegan has no benefit, both in the samsara and in the nirvana.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:07.000
 The all the miserables, the all the difficulties, challenges,

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:13.000
 really brought up by un-vegan in the samsara.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:18.000
 As I said yesterday too, I mean, it's not just I'm saying we don't know.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:23.000
 It's truly, that's truly been experienced in our mind.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:28.000
 For example, in the samsara, everyone wants happiness,

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:33.000
 everyone wants privilege, payment members, associations,

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.000
 associations with each other, relationships, all of that.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:43.000
 That is one of the goals, one of the eight goals, the concerns,

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:50.000
 gain and obtaining, that is really our weakest.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:58.000
 All the beings of samsara, to gain, to have reputation, to good things,

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:06.000
 and to relationship, friends, family member, and we make so much effort.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:11.000
 That is because that's what we like to do, we make efforts.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:18.000
 This un-vegan, the anger that comes holds that what you built up for years.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:23.000
 It smashes, it really destroys.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:28.000
 To build up the friendships, it's not just going to become friendly immediately.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:34.000
 Many times it takes time, gradually we build the trustees,

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:39.000
 you build the friendships, become friends, friends.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000
 But the years of the effort of the friendships,

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:50.000
 destroyed by the, maybe five minutes, the unpatient activities,

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:57.000
 unpatient, the whole, that destroyed within one, that five minutes,

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:03.000
 or maybe even seconds, that we all know is not mystery.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:09.000
 They think, as I said, in all the kind of good things in the samsara,

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:16.000
 the families, beautiful families, luxurious homes, luxurious old, everything,

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:21.000
 beachfront houses, old front houses, the ocean, the lakefront views,

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:27.000
 and the mountains, the baths, the jacuzzas, the hot tub, and the swimming pools,

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:33.000
 that every desire of the old, indigenous waters coming according to temperature,

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000
 what you desire, and make those things.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000
 Such precious atmospheres.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:44.000
 But one or two times unpatient activity again smashes all that.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000
 And this is what samsara means.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000
 Really, it's true.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000
 Because why it's happening?

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000
 It's unpatient.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.000
 Many times those destroyed has not big meanings.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000
 It's not big deals.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:03.000
 Because our stubbornness of the ego clinging,

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:11.000
 and our kind of arrogance, and arrogance, and jealousness,

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.000
 whatever the reason, it just smashes all things.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000
 It completely blinded us.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:23.000
 Becomes the dark, creates the dark, and don't see anything, and then smashes.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:31.000
 When that happens, the end, almost everyone feels so bad, so ashamed,

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:37.000
 unwilling, then they start blaming to themselves for destroying themselves.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000
 All different ways.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:45.000
 This all started because of the unpatients.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000
 In the samsara we talk.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000
 That is why I have that.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.000
 The whole apprenticeships, whole harmonies,

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:59.000
 peacefuls, communications, everything is destroyed.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.000
 But on the other hand, we have the patience.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.000
 There are patience.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000
 And in the teachings it, let it go.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000
 Let it go.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000
 Let it come.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.000
 Let it go.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.000
 Not holding onto that.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.000
 Onto that.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.000
 Then we continue ego with the friendships.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.000
 And we can learn, we can teach, we can support each other,

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000
 we can clarify those things.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:33.000
 Don't have to destroy it right there.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.000
 The old efforts.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.000
 That is what this, that's in the samsaras.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.000
 Then in the Buddha teaching, in the nirvana,

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000
 patience has no benefit at all.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000
 In the Buddha teaching, when that happened,

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.000
 for example, in the samsara, that not ended right there.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.000
 We created negative calmness.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.000
 One great Master Shanti Deva said,

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.000
 "The one-third of the eons of the making offerings,

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.000
 generously, morality practices,

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:11.000
 that many chori is destroyed by their one moment of anger."

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000
 In the teaching sense.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:18.000
 Anger, therefore anger has no value.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000
 Anger has no value, anger has no quality, good quality,

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:28.000
 at all, except is 100% and one is positive.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.000
 Bad.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000
 It's disturbance.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:37.000
 The biggest obstacles among all the negative beings is anger.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:44.000
 For that reason again, said there is no worse bad karma

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 than the anger activities.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:52.000
 There is no better good karma than the patience.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 Therefore, every means of the effort make patience, be patient.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000
 That's really the teaching sense.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000
 Is it true?

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.000
 If the samsara is so clear, then we can see.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.000
 It's not something that we have to believe.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000
 It's evidence.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.000
 Evidence.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:20.000
 Our own eyewitness or our own senses are witnessed.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000
 This is how it is.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000
 So therefore, thinking the bad resolve,

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:32.000
 bad aspect of the anger and thinking of the good

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:38.000
 and benefit of the patient, then we should practice patient practice,

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:43.000
 patient parameters, patient parameters.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.000
 And so now this patient parameter, as I say,

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:54.000
 I mean not as I say that, but we know that it is subdivided into three sections.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:34:00.000
 Patient and I kind of just trying to say exactly as an individual

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000
 in the English or the meaning roughly trying to translate it into English.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.000
 And then we go a little bit over on those each point.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:14.000
 The first one is, is...

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:21.000
 and the...

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:29.000
 Never mind, never mind attitude toward all the obstacles

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000
 or toward all the harm-doors.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.000
 Harm-doors may be harm, harm-doors.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:41.000
 Never mind attitude to all the harm-doors.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.000
 So that's number one.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:54.000
 Second is, joyfully, openly accepting all the challenges and difficulties.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.000
 That is second.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.000
 And third is, then,

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 never bored and tired of the doing good practice

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:13.000
 or good deeds, such as parabola practices, six parabola practices.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:19.000
 Or never scared and afraid of the profound meaning of the teachings.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:29.000
 So those are three patient practices, highlight patient practices.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000
 That's now what we discussed on this patient practice.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:38.000
 And we went yesterday, the world meaning of the patient.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.000
 Sanskrit meaning, the world meaning.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:50.000
 And then, second, we went with the division or the benefit of the patient.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:56.000
 There is a poem that I kind of listed as one after another.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.000
 Maybe not so clear. I don't know if you read that poem.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:03.000
 That is the same as all the parabolas.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000
 Po, po, po.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:09.000
 Each one is slightly different according to each of those.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:14.000
 It's like opposite. It purifies opposite of each of those.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:21.000
 And that means, again, that means, for example, opposite with generosity is the miserous.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:29.000
 When you do the generous practices, it purifies miserous or it reduces the miserous.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:36.000
 When we do the moralic practices, it purifies opposite demoralities.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:44.000
 And when you practice all the patient, it will purify the angles, angles, angles.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000
 So far, so easy.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.000
 Then, second, second, benefit as the same thing.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:56.000
 Second and third and fourth, benefit all the same to all the parabolas.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000
 And then, also, it went so.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:04.000
 Second one is, maybe yesterday, I kind of said it's like different orders,

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000
 but it's the same thing.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:14.000
 Second is great realization of the emptiness of each meaning of the poems of patient.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.000
 Patient is also, nature is emptiness.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.000
 And most same thing, generously, nature is emptiness.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.000
 Morality, nature is emptiness.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.000
 Patient, nature is emptiness.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000
 And how that can happen?

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000
 Because patient is who is really doing patient.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000
 It's no other than our mind.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.000
 Mind is empty.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:43.000
 Or at least nobody part of the mind, ever since.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:48.000
 But that's up in all the enlightenment ways, even the scientists,

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.000
 all this modern physics, really never own.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.000
 Therefore, it's called emptiness.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:00.000
 So, the patient is also the same thing.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.000
 It's within that same nature.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000
 It's nothing different than nature.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.000
 Nature.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.000
 Then, patient in the teachings, the third one.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000
 Each parabola is the same.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000
 It will fulfill the wishes of you.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:18.000
 Once you want your own wishes, it will fulfill.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.000
 And wishes of others, it will fulfill.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:26.000
 Others, according to the degree of the,

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:30.000
 or the degree and intensity of the parameters,

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.000
 it will help to you, it will to the others.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000
 And the fourth one.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.000
 Then, this parabola, when we do the parabola practice,

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.000
 we are communicated with each, the videos.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:47.000
 By your physical language, which is known as body language.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:51.000
 Or, such as, what's it called?

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.000
 Wobbly communicated, you're doing parabola practice.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.000
 So, whoever heard these things or see these things,

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.000
 it will make some impressions.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.000
 Impressions.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.000
 Impressions, it will lead in the teachings,

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:10.000
 it will connect to their designated karmas or capabilities.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.000
 And such as three yanas.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:18.000
 And Shabrokayana, perfect Bodhayana, and Bodhisattva yana,

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.000
 it will lead to their final,

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.000
 past passage of their final goals of realization.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.000
 So, those are, we discussed yesterday,

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.000
 but again, I'm talking, that moment was trying to,

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.000
 kind of, highlight them like this.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.000
 With this, now, when you come to the patient parameter,

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.000
 we're going to practice of this.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:45.000
 There's three divisions, as I already said, three.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:52.000
 First is, never mind attitude toward harm tools.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.000
 Harm drugs.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.000
 That is, again, why?

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:00.000
 Because our bodies are there.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.000
 Because our only practices.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.000
 We're doing this, not just for ourselves,

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.000
 but for all the things.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.000
 The primary purpose is, we're going to do it,

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.000
 because we are going to defeat the most powerful obstacles,

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:21.000
 or powerful enemies.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:26.000
 The ego claims, negative emotions.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:32.000
 They've been our, they've been the hindrance to us,

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.000
 and obstacles to us.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.000
 The armament, the ongoing enemies to us,

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.000
 disturbing our joy and peace, happiness,

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:47.000
 ever since, from the beginning times.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:53.000
 Today, we are going to process to defeat them.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.000
 Therefore, we are going to top, kind of, like,

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:02.000
 skills and methods and challenges we're going to get up there.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:05.000
 In the Great Mosque of Shanti Devas, in these cities,

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:08.000
 when you like to perform the big goals,

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.000
 you have to go somewhere over the hardships.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.000
 For example, if we got sick,

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.000
 if we got very sick, or some kind of, like, bad sick,

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000
 we go top treatment,

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:25.000
 because we're going to be patient with that top treatment,

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.000
 such as surgeries.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:31.000
 We're going to be patient, even though it's cutting our borders.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.000
 We're going to be doing the surgeries to our body,

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.000
 but we're going to be patient with that,

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.000
 because we're going to defeat big, big things,

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000
 more bigger than death.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.000
 Same way, we're going to defeat this negative emotion,

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.000
 negative enemies.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:53.000
 For that reason, we're known as also courageous for enlightenment.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:56.000
 Courageous for our enlightenment, for ourselves,

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.000
 courageous for enlightenment, for all the beings.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.000
 That is what the reason the warrior is, true warriors.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.000
 As I said yesterday, the Great Mosque of Shanti Devas said,

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.000
 "When you defeat the enemy or the negative emotion,

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:16.000
 that is the great warrior."

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.000
 That is really warriors.

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.000
 One way somebody can be in the samsara,

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.000
 because he or she killed that enemy.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.000
 But that, according to Dharma, is not the warriors,

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.000
 not the bravery, that's timid.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000
 We're really going to die,

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000
 die in killing that again.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.000
 What has formed?

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:41.000
 It looks like kind of like putting the arrow or the knife

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:44.000
 or the sword to the corpse.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.000
 Corpse.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000
 That is not the one.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.000
 The trauma challenge, divorce and enemies,

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.000
 is a negative emotion.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:55.000
 That is going to defeat.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.000
 Completely defeated.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.000
 Uproot.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:03.000
 Kick out from the area of our space

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:07.000
 to straight of the great emptiness.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.000
 That is truly warriors.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:13.000
 They have, with full of courage, full of commitment,

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.000
 full of confidence,

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:20.000
 and we are going to then take care of all those different

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.000
 opponents or the difficulty, whatever the hindrance counts,

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.000
 we are going to take care of them.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000
 We are going to have the attitude of

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:31.000
 never mind the harm to the harm those.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:34.000
 Plus, also in the teaching scene,

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.000
 I suggest the great one, Chandi Deva II,

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.000
 if anybody is doing harmful,

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:43.000
 if we have the patient, that is really, they are putting us test.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000
 They are training us.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.000
 Without the trainings,

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:51.000
 we are not going to become the warriors.

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.000
 For example, we like to go to the Olympic Games.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:44:00.000
 Or like Russell Stadiums, or those platforms, Russells.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.000
 You have to train.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.000
 You have to train both of the muscles.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:11.000
 But these sentient beings are pretty offering us

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:15.000
 the exercise, pretty offering.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.000
 Therefore, in the teaching,

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:22.000
 they are the primary cause to lead enlightenment.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000
 They are really, truly.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:27.000
 If there is only the instructions,

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000
 but not trainers,

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.000
 we won't get enlightenment.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.000
 We are thankful to the Buddhas

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.000
 and the great Bodhisattvas

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.000
 because they are blessings, they are instructions,

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.000
 they are all the wisdom.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.000
 True.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:46.000
 But who is putting all the wisdom in the test

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.000
 and exercise in the practical manuals?

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.000
 These sentient beings.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.000
 Therefore, in the teaching said,

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.000
 we should thankful equally to the Buddhas

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.000
 and to sentient beings.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.000
 Both are kind.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.000
 One is showing how to do, practice all that,

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:09.000
 and the other is giving the test and the training.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.000
 Therefore, thankful.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:16.000
 Instead, feel upset and following emotions.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:20.000
 If we follow the emotions, we are subjected,

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.000
 under the subject of the emotions.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.000
 Then we lost, we become the victims.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000
 That's what we become.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.000
 In the teaching said,

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:33.000
 we become the slavery of the emotions, negative emotions.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.000
 We will become the servant.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.000
 Not just the servant once and while,

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:41.000
 like kind of like in the hours or few hours,

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:46.000
 the whole constant, whole lifetime, day and night,

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:50.000
 we become the slavery of the emotions, negative emotions.

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:55.000
 This means for a long time, not just a short time.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000
 From the beginning of this time,

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:00.000
 we've been slavery of the negative emotions.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.000
 Today is the great teaching of the great teacher,

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:06.000
 Buddha Kya Kya Muni, all the Bodhisattvas.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:09.000
 We are really going to change the course.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:14.000
 How wonderful, how beautiful, how special.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.000
 Therefore, the palm blowers are so good.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:20.000
 For those reasons, what a great master,

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:23.000
 just like most of Tommy's in 37 practices.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:24.000
 What did he say?

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:25.000
 I mean, you read those.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000
 Many of you already know.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:29.000
 I also did read the teaching.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.000
 One of the teachers said,

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:35.000
 the one I'm taking care of my own son,

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:40.000
 one I took care of as my own son or my own child,

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:45.000
 that same one made me all the obstacles,

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:49.000
 made a whole state of enemies.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:53.000
 Instead, get upset to that.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:58.000
 He should be more thankful that he's putting me

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:01.000
 in the test of the patience.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:05.000
 Thankful to God. We accept that situation.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:09.000
 Thankfully and even more kindly to that person

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:14.000
 as like mother is so kind when the children are sick.

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:17.000
 Children are sick, the mother is so kind.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:20.000
 Same way, they're sick mentally sick.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.000
 Therefore, I instead get upset.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.000
 I should be thankful and take care of them.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:28.000
 That is practice of the Bodhisattva.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:31.000
 That's what really great master.

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.000
 Just say what your Tommy is.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:38.000
 It is one of the 37 standards of these teachings.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.000
 So that's how it is.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:43.000
 So that's an understanding of that.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.000
 And with that, then we go.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:49.000
 Those three patient practices just one up another.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.000
 Really, we go.

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:54.000
 So I mentioned and thank you again.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:57.000
 Thank you very much, everyone, for participating.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:00.000
 And listening, and thank you.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.000
 Okay, thank you very much, everyone.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:03.000
 Thank you.

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:04.000
 Thank you.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:05.000
 Thank you.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:06.000
 Everyone.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:09.000
 Now we do a short meditation.

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:29.000
 Thank you.
