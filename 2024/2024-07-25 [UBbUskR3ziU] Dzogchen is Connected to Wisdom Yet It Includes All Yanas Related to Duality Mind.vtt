00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.400
 They are all connected with mind. In Dzogchen teachings, when you reach to Dzogchen,

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:13.040
 when you have true meditation as you are really speaking to, that is not mental state. It is

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:22.000
 wisdom. So when you look to the point of Dzogchen, it all is convention related to this. But even

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:31.680
 though it is all convention, it all came from Dzogchen. It all connected to Dzogchen. It's part

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:40.080
 of the passage, part of the staircase to Dzogchen Realizations. As here, here is the dark example,

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:48.960
 they all are like going to the ocean of Dzogchen. And Dzogchen teaching is the source of the oceans

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:48.960
,

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:58.800
 source of the waters, but also it protect back all the waters into the into ocean, ocean self.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:06.720
 Similarly, Dzogchen is Dzogchen or that here, also said here. For example, streams of the

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.800
 disperse of the from air gather back to the oceans. So this is Patangaragarbha or Dzogchen,

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:20.560
 the ultimate nature of the Lhukin is the source of all this displays that we heard in the teaching

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.400
 making too. Not just all this fun, but the samsara and the rana and the positive and the rana,

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:34.960
 all that came and reflected from the Dzogchen or from the Dzogchen or from Dzogchen Dzogchen.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:42.480
 Due to the different reasons where we had that. And that therefore Dzogchen is the foundation

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:49.360
 very foundation of the of the of the all the teachings foundations Dzogchen teaching

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:55.200
 foundation. And then that then later also coming more Dzogchen too so we can talk that but

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.760
 generally

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:09.920
 Dzogchen is the ultimate state, status and all that. So that is really about this.
