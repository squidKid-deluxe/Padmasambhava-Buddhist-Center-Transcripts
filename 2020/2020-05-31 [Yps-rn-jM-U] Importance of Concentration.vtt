00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.160
 Again, thank you very much everyone. Welcome and welcome everyone. Again, this is one of the

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:22.440
 virtual times we all get triggered in a different situation, in different circumstances by these

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.000
 technologies, we are already triggered.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 And going to reflect the teaching of the great teacher, kindness teacher, complicated teacher,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 Buddha Caitanya.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 As told by Yadhi, the new religious. So we are going on that trophics, and that we are reflecting,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 going through those trophics,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:01:04.540
 glorifying, repolishing of our practice, our meditation, our knowledge of Dharma as we received the

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.000
 teaching or as we learned from many great masters and teachers.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.040
 Whatever we name, all lamas. And again, in order to do that, according to the lineage instruction,

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.000
 we should be strengthening our beautiful motivation.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.290
 And what I am saying is beautiful motivation. We have so many motivations. Some are not so

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:29.000
 beautiful. Some are okay, but this time I am talking beautiful motivation.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:37.290
 Motivation of the joy and appreciation. And of ourselves, and as well as situation and

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:46.000
 circumstances, what we are surrounded with joy and appreciation.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:54.510
 And that is also foundation, heart of the Dharma. Joy and appreciation. When you practice Dharma,

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:02.240
 following the path of the Buddha teaching, it's joyous, it's beautiful, it's happiness, it's

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.000
 objective.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 Today we are all on that path. How wonderful, how beautiful.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.570
 And at the same time, not just a kind of joy, appreciation, or kind of more kind of privately

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.000
 personalized that.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.290
 We are going to open the door to all living beings. That's what always in the teaching mission,

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.000
 vastness, motivation of the both each other, for all living beings.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:41.700
 Numbless, vastness of the beings, all living beings, vastness, motivation means the object is vast,

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.000
 subject is vast, and the benefit is vast.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.710
 What that means? The object, I am talking about all the beings. There are no numbers of the beings

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.000
 according to the Buddha's teaching.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:08.910
 The old, there are so many beings. As far as the sky goes, that far, or the space goes, that far is

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.000
 sentient beings, or the beings.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:21.660
 As long as those sentient beings are, as much as sentient beings, that much, there is karma and

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.000
 negative emotions.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:32.880
 And as well as the karma and the negative emotions, there is always difficult, challenging,

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.000
 troubles all over.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.980
 Therefore, it's vast, object is vast. Subject is vast, because when we don't have the boundaries of

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.000
 the ego cleaning, or the duality conceptions,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:55.860
 when widely open, our love and kindness compare your thoughts for all living beings, there is no

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:03.000
 limitation, no boundaries of the deep, of our nature of the mind.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:15.320
 Is vastness, is the deepest, as sky, infinite as sky, vast as sky. That's what many times in the

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:21.000
 teaching mission, the inner space, truly it is.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:28.890
 We are opening that inner space, the role of the traitors. That is what vastness. The benefit is

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:30.000
 vast.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 Power is vast, because when you open the door of that beautiful motivation to every living being,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 it really touches the ripple effort with that benefit,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:50.870
 or that currents of the energy are vibrating according to the teaching, and in the cyber highway of

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:59.000
 the infinite space of the inner nature, or the emptiness, it is going to everyone.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:06.600
 Power is benefit. Therefore, vastness, motivation of the bodhicitta is the only key to reach

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:12.000
 enlightenment, or to benefit other beings, to benefit ourselves.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:21.750
 That's what is mentioned or told by all the buddhas, and all those great masters, one after another

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:26.000
, who reaches that realization such as enlightenment,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 of what we call all great enlightenment, great masters.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 Why they call great masters? They call the buddhas, it's not great, something kind of different.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 Their love and kind is great, their compassion is great,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:49.950
 their power of effort is great, therefore it's called greatest. Their kind is great. They're so

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.000
 humble and so simple.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.040
 Simple. And just don't act. Not trapped by the ego-clinging, the whole name of something kind of

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:04.000
 fancy, the different things, but trapped on ego-clinging, or olden effort.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:11.800
 Therefore, they're great. For that is really, everyone say, in order to reach that realization is

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.000
 what we admire, and we like to get that goal and realization.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 For our beauty and the beauty of others, that's the only way to go.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.650
 And along with that, in the teachings of the new matthu, always mentioned, this activated the

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:32.000
 divine qualities of the inner natures,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:39.590
 and which is known as three major states. The subject is divine, object is divine, everything is

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:43.000
 divine, olden level.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 And while I'm saying olden level, that when it is not obscured, who obscured our own duality?

00:06:52.000 --> 00:07:00.250
 Publication of the obscurations are obscured of the divine quality. What I'm using terminally as a

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:03.000
 divine, or otherwise versatile.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:14.980
 The way your nature is obscured by our own mystic. But today, we are leaning and making

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:19.000
 determination to discover our own new nature.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 So therefore, let's begin to open that goal right now. Not just waiting for some time. Right now,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 that is our responsibility, our identity to practice.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 That's the practitioners. We practice. We practice all that, activating that qualities.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.090
 So therefore, all with those beautiful motivations, beautiful qualities, that is what beautiful

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:46.000
 motivation is.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:53.300
 And we have in that beautiful motivation, our foundation is beautiful, study is beautiful, our

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.000
 journey will be beautiful,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:02.760
 and our goal, achievement will be beautiful. That is what we need. That's what in the teaching said

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:03.000
.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 And with that, then, now, we go to the teaching. It's something what we are going through.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000
 We got with more motivations, and we go to the teaching.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.810
 And the teaching itself, again, we might come to go more direct to the target, what we're

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:21.000
 discussing.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:28.380
 What we're discussing is then actualizing bodhicata, and within that is the sixth paramata. We are

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:29.000
 going.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 That teaching. This sixth paramata teaching is not just what we are doing, but this is encompassing

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 the entire practice,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:44.290
 the entire teaching of the Buddha Dharma. All the practices, if we like to practice, meditate,

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:46.000
 actualize our realization,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:53.280
 or we like to benefit to other beings, or at least make meaningful of our dislike, that we exist in

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.000
 this world.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.880
 Like to live this world to something really nicely beautiful, the sixth paramata is the answer to

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.000
 practice.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
 That's the reading the teaching said. Sixth paramata is the answer.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:11.000
 That's it. So we are going through the sixth paramata, one after another, letter by letter,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 slowly, reflectedly, going through all the triangles of the beauty of each college.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
 One after another, that's really what we made, according to my capabilities.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 And I say so many times, I hope it will also, some really, contribute your understanding,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 your knowledge, what you already learned, or refresh at least of those, your learnings,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:43.000
 your experience, and your practices, our practices, to you and to me, all of that.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 And among that, we are in the fifth paramata. And again, I just want to list it.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 That is just listed of those names. First, the generous paramata, second is morality paramata,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:09.000
 and third is passion paramata, and fourth is joyful effort to the virtues of the dharma paramata,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 and then fifth is the concentration paramatas. That's what I've been translating into English.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:23.000
 In it to be, it is some detail, part of the symbol, all beyond paramatas.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000
 Or it can be translated, I think, maybe, meditation paramatas.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:33.000
 Meditation paramata, but most of the time, I saw, people are using concentration,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 so that I'm using, but you can choose.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:43.000
 Whatever the terminology is best, and more understanding, or sensible, touch,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 so that terminology is, is generally, is whatever, whatever you use is for the meditation.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:57.000
 Meditation is, as I said, yesterday and other days, these are all the paramatas.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:05.000
 Fourth three paramatas are mainly teachings on how to be, be more beautiful,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 more virtuous with our physical and worldly.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:18.000
 And joyful effort to the dharma paramata is support and help for all the paramatas.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 So that means all the five paramatas.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 And then bacon paramata is more, sorry, concentrated paramata,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 or beyond paramata is more connected with the mind.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:38.000
 And the mind is so important. It is a ruler of everything.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:46.570
 Ikore Buddha teachings. They are everything. That means both samsara, nirvana, all murdered from

00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:48.000
 the mind.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:57.680
 When we don't control our own mind, that is the beginning in the process of developing the samsaras

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:58.000
.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 When we control our mind on the virtues or the nidana, that is,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 we are the process of developing the nirvana or, as I use the word, part to the dharma.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 Part truth. Part truth. That is part truth.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 Everybody is doing the virtues of the mind.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 Nice. And both start from this mind, mind of emptiness.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 Both start from this. So therefore, controlling mind is so important, the most important.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000
 And what are the teachings? Even if you do the practicing or the jainting,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000
 don't pause the years if you don't have the concentration or the meditation,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
 then it won't bring big benefits.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 Even pause the years in the teaching set.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 Even pause the years if we are doing the asatic practices and all that,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:08.000
 but if we don't control our mind, it won't make big differences.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 Mind is the issue, the principle issue.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:18.000
 If we really control our mind, we are controlling everything.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:27.480
 Every troubles of samsara, we are controlling, not just controlling, if we continually pursue that,

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:28.000
 we are uprooting the samsara.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 Samsara of our own perception, our own conception, our own samsara.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 When we are uprooting our own samsara, when we are beginning process of uprooting our own samsara,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:52.000
 that is the time we begin to also start benefiting for others.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000
 Benefiting to ourselves, benefiting to others.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:04.290
 Then with that being, we can perform more effectively our body health activities or compassion

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:05.000
 activities.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 We can effectively perform compassion activities when we have good control of the mind.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 Then, as in the teaching set, all our fulfillment or achievement of the realization is totally best

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 on the mind of good concentrations.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 Such as visualizations, salam practices, tumu practices, as well as all those zuki meditations.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:49.000
 The Mohammedan meditations, all is best on the controlling or the best on the concentrations.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:57.480
 If we don't have any control of our own mind, even we see such as profound teachings of the zuki

00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:00.000
 teachings or Mohammedan teachings

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:07.290
 or teachings on the great emptiness of the blissfulness, or union of the great blissfulness of the

00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:08.000
 emptiness,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:15.000
 or the Mademaka teachings, if we don't trap up on the good foundation of the meditation,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 or if we don't have the control of our mind, it's almost like throwing those all in the sand.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 Like water is thrown in the sand, it won't just evaporate.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 Or even throw in the water in the sand of the desert, it just won't evaporate.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 Therefore, this concentration is really so important.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:52.000
 Every language for any of the practice or certain practices, it is the mind.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:16:01.390
 For that reason, Ache Shanthi Deva said, no matter what, if you actually have good moralities, good

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:02.000
 practices,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:08.000
 any of those generalist practices, morality practices, and patient practices,

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:14.000
 the key issue is if we have the control of our mind, then all the purpose.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 For that reason, he said, our, with folded hands, that as Shanthi Deva said,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 with folded hands, I will, of course, take care of your mind.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
 It's so important.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000
 And that's just roughly the meaning of the untaxed version of that.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:38.000
 So this is what is really the meditation is so important.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
 Concentration is so important.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
 And it's just not so important.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.000
 It's totally best, totally dependent on our achievement on this.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
 So for that reason, there is vast teachings, vastness teachings,

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 great teachings of Buddha Kshakti Mani, and as well as all the great master's teaching

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:06.830
 on very detailed polls on these issues, on these topics, topics of the meditation and concentration

00:17:06.830 --> 00:17:07.000
.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
 So that's what really we are going through.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:15.000
 Again, yesterday we went, and again, I will go the same way today, too.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 There have been all those topics, as much as I can.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:24.000
 Yesterday I said, the principle cause of meditation,

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:31.000
 or cause of the good meditation, good meditation, the great master,

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:38.000
 the Kamala Chala, highlight of the six, those are one after another.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 And he gathered all those, essence teachings of Buddhas,

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.000
 Buddha teachings, both Mahayana Suttas, or Suttas, not just Mahayana,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 teachings of the Buddhas, Yandere and the Suttas,

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:57.000
 and Abhidharma and Vinaya, all the Nithiripitakas of the Buddha teaching.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000
 And when he had a teaching, he compiled and took it.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 He's one of such great scholars, meditation master's.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.000
 So he put, took it there, that to the, by his comparison,

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 to the sake of the whole good practice of that time,

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000
 that made at century and then, then from that own word,

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:24.000
 as recorded by the Kain Chasondebji, great Kain Chasondebji

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 or Dharma Kain Chasondebji recorded.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 So I listed yesterday all those, one after another.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:37.000
 Those are the cause, each of those, I'm sure we all heard those,

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000
 heard so many times, but how is the life of those?

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000
 Nothing like that.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 That is known as contraplitence, that the mind from us.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.000
 Each has meaning, each has a flavor, each of those points.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000
 And we really like to help to our meditation practice.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000
 Each has beautiful flavor, beautiful meaning, beautiful effect.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 They're not just, it's gossiping.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000
 It's not gossiping, it's not just the Kain Chasondebji talking things.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000
 Practical manual, exactly how we could develop

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 and how we get fulfillment of the, our goal of the Dharma, that.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 So first is, again, if I say, what I said yesterday,

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000
 I'm sure many of you know already, even before that,

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 and many of, maybe a few of you, maybe even written that listed

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
 and the post is terrible places.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.000
 And that is, I'm mentioning about hermitage.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.000
 Because hermitage or hermitage is excellently so important.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 In the debate, it's called Vibha.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:55.000
 Vibha, Vibha means hermitage or excellency.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:01.000
 Excellency provides. In the teachings, there's many different explanations,

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000
 but we simplify two excellations.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000
 Excellations of the busy physical verbal activities,

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.000
 excellations of the mental activities of the all-commanding conceptions.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.000
 These are two important excellations,

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 which I also used terminology or the English language, hermitage.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000
 Hermitage, two hermitages.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000
 Hermitage from the physical activities,

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000
 hermitage of the mental activities, three activities.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000
 I use that, and that is, of course, you can choose

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:42.000
 whichever world is more meaning, lined up the meaning, world meanings.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.000
 And our first is hermitage is all the activities.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000
 Busy activity, mundane activity, is that is,

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:56.000
 you already that activity, that's what people go to the hermitage.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000
 You must have read many life stories of the old,

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000
 great master of the nimma and kadim.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000
 So many, they went to the mountains.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000
 Not just the city in the Somway Khan, but on the mountains.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000
 They always, they're so beautiful.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000
 The fresh air, pretty woods, vast woods.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000
 The birds are sinking, and the deers are roaming,

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000
 or the animals are roaming freely.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000
 And the Lego time, there's just the environment

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000
 of the complete total freedoms.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:31.000
 Freedom and openness and purity and pristine views.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.000
 Really imagine the beautiful hermitage, the price to the hermitage.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:39.000
 All that movement is the trees, and the movement of the tree,

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 wind with the wind and the leaves, and all that.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.000
 It is really, they express as just beautiful.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000
 It is in giant places.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000
 Those are what the hermitage said.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000
 So I said those are hermitage.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000
 And that is, the hermitage had five qualities.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000
 I went yesterday, all that, as a great master,

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000
 the asangal or the mettle, toad.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000
 I went one after another. Those.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:13.000
 But the most important is the hermitage of the old physical activities.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000
 And some teachings said that, some teachings said,

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000
 "F" is the favorite replaces in the perfect,

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000
 or those like this meat, what is explained yesterday

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000
 in this five qualities of the hermitage.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.000
 A meat is even a city, and you can stay in the city too.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000
 "F" it needs to be that qualities.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000
 But otherwise, this hermitage is so important.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000
 And among the best hermitage is each and those great masters,

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000
 such as Guru Pya Masambha Buddha Shakti Muni.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000
 All the great masters, such as Malarepa, Kung Chimpa,

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000
 and all those great masters made it into practice,

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.000
 those hermitage are known as the sacred places, holy places.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000
 They're blessed. They're saturated.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000
 Those land and art and area is really with their blessings,

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000
 by their love, their kindness, their compassion,

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000
 their joy for effort, their courage, their commitment.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:16.000
 That blessed, that area, the land is saturated with that blessings.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 And our upper day, so many great practitioners,

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 they're very great practitioners,

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000
 when they meditate, they practice that again,

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000
 and that becomes again in the saturated depth of areas.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000
 So land is completely blessed.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:36.000
 Those blessed areas are excellent every time those blessings.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:44.000
 That if none of the best is, again, those all call it what I listed yesterday, fire.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000
 So that is called favorable places.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:51.000
 And then I went yesterday in the Kamala Khala Sicha,

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:57.000
 said the less desires, less desire.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000
 I mean, we heard all that work so many times.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.000
 Buddha teaching said too, one who has less desire, more contentment,

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000
 is noble, what great teacher Buddha said.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 It's noble crime, crime, C-L-A-N, is a crime of noble.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000
 They are the payment of the nobles.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000
 Less desire, more contentment.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:29.000
 That is the leader known as what the Buddha teaching said.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.000
 He said, no ba chuma, cho hi ba papa rebels,

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.000
 a crime of nobles.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000
 Less desire, more content, is a desire,

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 a crime of the nobles or payment of nobles.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000
 And therefore, that is what it is.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:56.000
 What that will do, it will produce all our busyness activities, worries,

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000
 so much worries, and we have more desires.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000
 It's never enough.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000
 One is not enough, then we want more.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 And more is not enough, we want excellent ones.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000
 Excellent and we want more excellent.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000
 And to do that, what is the teaching said?

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000
 And the troubles of the getting that,

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000
 troubles of the maintaining that,

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.000
 troubles of the increasing that, or multiplying that,

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:29.000
 then we worries, or sometimes if we don't have the able to maintain,

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.000
 we worries, or in our decline, it's going to dawn.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000
 I'm not going to lose my reputation.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.000
 I will be not on the list of the upper classes.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.000
 All those worries, one after another, comes.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000
 Comes, so many pussy.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000
 But what for that?

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:53.000
 In the long run, we're thinking of that for just maybe 20 years, 30 years.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000
 But for that we have to leave.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000
 I'm not just threatening that, it's true.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:05.000
 50 years, maximum maybe 100 years, then all gone.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.000
 We leave.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 But during that time, we process of that.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:14.000
 So many calm as we created, so many negative emotions are created.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000
 Instead of benefiting, helping to the other pain,

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 maybe we're hurting more, more disturbing more.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000
 Directly, indirectly.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:28.000
 And our self also created more negative emotions.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000
 And all that, then that's called,

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.000
 because of the trying to keep the greed of the ego clean,

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.000
 we couldn't perform.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.000
 Perform.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:45.000
 And so that is known as, for that reason, less desire.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.000
 And more content, more content.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:57.000
 Whatever you have, happy, joy, every hit, enjoy.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.000
 Instead of trying to follow all those different things,

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:08.000
 extremely, reach of the heart, reach of love, reach of compassion.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000
 That is our goal.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000
 But we're talking that.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.000
 Our goal of this practice of meditating entirely is really best of compassion.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000
 The body is not compassion.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000
 So cherish that.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.000
 Glorified.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000
 Man's strong.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.000
 Man extends.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.000
 Reveal that more every care.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:34.000
 That is then known as the practitioners of the Bodhisattvas,

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.000
 following the path of the greatest teacher,

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:42.000
 Buddha Shatyamuni, and following the path of worship of all,

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000
 called enlightenment.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.000
 How wonderful.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.000
 How beautiful it is.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.000
 So that is it.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:53.000
 So about favorable places and less desire, more contentment.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.000
 And then, next one is what Kamala Shabas.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000
 Have good moralities.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:06.000
 Good morality will help to get our good meditation.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000
 Good moralities.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000
 That means, again, what moralities?

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000
 We went morality early.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.000
 And of course, you all know that morality.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000
 It's ethics in the simple way.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:24.000
 Ethics of the samsara of the worldly ethics, good ethics,

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.000
 and the ethics of the one Buddha taught.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000
 One Buddha taught in the teaching,

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 there are three ethics, according to the Vediyana teachings.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000
 The Vinaya ethics, Bodhisattva ethics,

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.000
 and Vediyana ethics.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.000
 All three vowels.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:51.000
 And Vinaya vowels, Bodhisattva vowels, and Vediyana vowels.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000
 And that is what for Vediyana practitioners,

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:59.000
 because Vediyana practitioners hold all those three vowels.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:05.000
 The vowels of the Vinaya, or the basic Buddhist foundation's vowels,

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 and as well as the Bodhisattva vowels, or Bodhisattva vowels,

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000
 and the Vediyana vowels.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000
 So we hold that vowels.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000
 And so therefore, what even vowels you have, for example,

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000
 upasana vowels, or the late practicing vowels,

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:31.000
 and above that Bodhisattva vowels is similar to everyone.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:37.000
 And then Vediyana vowels are similar.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000
 All the practitioners, whoever is involved in the teaching,

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000
 we hold that vowels.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.000
 So hold those as much as you can.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.000
 You can't really hold those.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:52.000
 Every somehow we've depicted those vowels, what the teaching says,

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 immediately or soon after.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000
 Where do you find that?

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000
 Where do you find that?

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:04.000
 Many times we can make the damage, wow, but purify.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:09.000
 And what is the best purification or the techniques?

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000
 Four vowels with very subtle practices,

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000
 and Vediyana teaching, or as when you march schools,

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.000
 always in the teaching center.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 Then otherwise, such as all these,

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000
 these such as 35 Buddha practices,

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:30.000
 all the meditory activities, meditory activities,

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:35.000
 such as the meditory activity of the six paramanas,

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:40.000
 all the three paramanas, anything that dedicated that merit

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:45.000
 or to purify, or to the cleansing of any of that errors,

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:52.000
 mistakes, or that cleared our vowels, damaged our vowels.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:58.000
 Then that is known as remaining on the good moralities.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:03.000
 When you have good moralities, good morality is simply what in teaching is it,

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.000
 less desire or contentment.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.000
 Contentment with mindfulness, with alertness,

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 with the consciousness or thought force.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000
 As much as we can apply, then really we keep.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.000
 And that is a part of meditating to mindfulness, concentrate.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:30.000
 That is part of the concentrators, part of the versatile practices.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000
 So that is the fourth one.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:38.000
 The fourth cause of the to have good meditation is the moralities.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000
 That is what great master Kamala Shraddha listed.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:48.000
 The next one, the picked one, is less activities.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.000
 That means what? Now we are in a hermitage.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000
 Let's say we are in a hermitage.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000
 Or we are maybe in a city too.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.000
 But everything quite good, all explained,

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.000
 means that now we are in retreat or hermitage.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000
 But now what?

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:13.000
 There is small activities going again, every kind of continuity.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:18.000
 Even if we are in a good hermitage and in a good retreat place,

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:24.000
 maybe there is so many kind of mundane activities going.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:34.000
 Such as how this is gossiping by the electronic texts, gossips.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:40.000
 Spending time on the computers, spending time on the telephones,

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 and spending time on the movies.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:51.000
 All that chat chatting, chat chatting.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:56.000
 And what is happening is distracted our mind.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.000
 Even here in hermitage, even in the year retreat,

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.000
 even here in every quality is a meter, all that.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:07.000
 Now we create another business, business.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:11.000
 And then in the teaching said, and also kind of meeting many Sangha members.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.000
 Ancient time many Sangha members in hermitage.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000
 There is also Sangha friends, all meeting Sangha members,

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.000
 chat chatting, talking, spending time,

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000
 and kind of discussing the welfare of the families,

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000
 this family doing that, that family doing this,

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000
 kind of bring the history of the past,

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.000
 and kind of all these processes are created,

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.000
 little bit kind of business activities and all that.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000
 And then also kind of let chores of each others

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000
 have been trying to do this thing.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:45.000
 And then what we lost our practice meditating time.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000
 So this is called activities.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000
 So when you are hermitage,

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.000
 whatever you meant, time periods, periods.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000
 And that's what in the great masters,

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:01.000
 in practice lineage created such a beautiful instruction of the hermitage.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:05.000
 What's called period, time, time zone, time zone.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000
 It means period, period, period.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.000
 And that period, keep up that period.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000
 That's that timetable to practices.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000
 Practice time is practice time.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.000
 The community or the health and the support,

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:23.000
 or keep up some of the chores they don't call it, that is that time.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000
 Keep that.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000
 That is also when you do that.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.000
 What is not going on?

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.000
 Is it discipline?

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.000
 Is it morality?

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.000
 Is it ethics?

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000
 You're keeping up the rhythms.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000
 Everything is rhythms.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000
 Seasons are rhythms.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000
 Summer has three months.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000
 Spring has three months.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.000
 And winter has three months.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000
 Autumn has three months.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000
 Day and night.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000
 Even the birds keep the seasons.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000
 Keep the season.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.000
 Exactly time.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000
 Stay in the rhythms.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.000
 Rhythms, and we don't stay in the rhythms.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000
 Rhythms, mixing up everything.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000
 Then we lost.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000
 Lost that.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:10.000
 So therefore, keep the time and the practices.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:15.000
 Not just creating kind of overlapping things back and forth.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.000
 That.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000
 And then we kind of lost the point.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.000
 That is what's known as less activities.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:28.000
 And the next one, spell the code for the meditation.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000
 Prefer the good meditation.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000
 Less code.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000
 Of course less code is so important.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.000
 Less code.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000
 But that means what?

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000
 Actually, of course when you meditate,

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000
 you have the lesson have to be less code.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:47.000
 But it means kind of all the past memories.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:52.000
 Reflecting past memories, past thought, past kind of things.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:57.000
 All the kind of, all the pleasures of the pipes and objects,

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.000
 these and that thing.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.000
 Now you're in meditation, hymnology, maybe you're sitting kind of nice.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:07.000
 But mind is wondering all those walls of the past, the present, and future.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:12.000
 All others kind of appears there and just completely busy.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.000
 You opened your, you two on all your brains.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.000
 You're really doing all that things.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.000
 Then what we did?

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000
 We lost the concentration.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000
 How all purpose of it?

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000
 Have beautiful meditate, calm, peaceful, relax on the present state.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.000
 What else will we do?

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:30.000
 The instruction.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000
 The instruction is lost.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000
 And the instruction is to build on more compassion, more love,

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.000
 more kindness, more bodhicitta, more relative to that,

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.000
 leading into every direction.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.000
 That's it.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000
 And now we state we are wondering of the kind of past memories,

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000
 or the present and future plans.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.000
 All that emanation already, we are going back and forth.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:58.000
 It just so, it just kind of like, we start spreading out.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.000
 Ripple effort is coming.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000
 Then lost the point.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000
 Lost the meanings.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000
 That is then what is.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:12.000
 Then we really lost the identity of the meditation.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:18.000
 So therefore, great Master Kamala Chala listed less thought.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000
 Less thought.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.000
 No thought.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000
 And when that happening,

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.000
 then what we need?

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000
 Mindfulness immediately catch.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000
 Immediately catch.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.000
 Go back to the point.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.000
 Back to what we started planning to do.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.000
 Lister your courage and commitment,

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:44.000
 confidence in joy, appreciate, devotion, bodhicitta, those increase.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.000
 And reaffirm yourself what I am doing.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.000
 I am wasting my time.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000
 Such precious moments.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:56.000
 I am going to, I have decided to do practice or meditation for two hours

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.000
 or one hour.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.000
 I am going to spend that.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.000
 I am spoiling that college.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.000
 College.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000
 What I am doing?

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:07.000
 I am thanks. Come really, max, don't say much to yourself.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000
 Be yourself as good teacher.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:14.000
 Or ourself a good teacher to our own self for that time.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.000
 Nobody is saying to you to do these and that things.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.000
 Back to yourself, ourself.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:25.000
 Say that I am really not doing good.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.000
 Waste my time.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.000
 I should not do.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.000
 Please, by the blessings of the Buddhas, the Bodhisattvas,

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.000
 and all the great masters bless me.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000
 Make my mind stronger.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000
 Make my mind more courageous.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.000
 More meaningful.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.000
 That I can, well not wasting my time.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:47.000
 Time and I like to make meaningful performance of this period.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.000
 So those are known as then.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:53.000
 Then, then known as sixth cause.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.000
 Sixth great cause for the meditations.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.000
 Meditation, all the way.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.000
 Chamath meditation.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.000
 Generally, meditations, what in the teachings,

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000
 there is so many different meditations.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:09.000
 You can always, can summarize within these two categories.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:13.000
 Chamath meditation and Vipassana meditations.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000
 We have meditations.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:19.000
 Chamath meditation is like foundation meditation.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.000
 It is stable like meditation.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.000
 In Chamath meditation, benefit of Chamath meditation is,

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:29.000
 as I already said, so many kind of, as early that.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000
 But also in the teachings, when you have the good Chamath meditation,

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.000
 then realize that you come really so nice and beautiful with that.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:42.000
 Even in the teachings say that the omniscient cause will come.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.000
 That's what the great master, also Adi has said in his teachings,

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:49.000
 that if you have the good Chamath meditation,

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:53.000
 then it will rise up the omniscient knowledge.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.000
 Omniscient means you can see the others, toward and on the minds.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:01.000
 All hard things, not just on the mind, but other things,

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.000
 far beyond than what we now know is mercy.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.000
 And when you have that, you can benefit more effectively.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:13.000
 But this time, when we're trying to help benefit for others,

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:17.000
 because we cannot effectively help.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.000
 Our whole kind of helping is almost under presumptions

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:24.000
 or when you see clearly, then you can help something,

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000
 every year at the capability.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000
 But otherwise, it's kind of presumptions.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.000
 I think it's good for, I think it's good,

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.000
 therefore I'm going to help something like that.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.000
 But otherwise, if you have clear knowledge,

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.000
 understand what others think and need there,

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.000
 then you can help more effectively, as the great Bodhisattva,

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000
 as Vada Shaktamani, Guru Pima Sambo.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:51.000
 Their benefit in helping is so effective, so direct, so targeted,

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:55.000
 because they see what they needed, what things are good.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:00.000
 So therefore, samadhi is really good in the teachings.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.000
 It will also develop those knowledge, those wisdom.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.000
 And then plus all the realization, all those achievements

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.000
 are coming from this samadhi meditation.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.000
 Once you have good stabilized meditation,

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:19.000
 and then vipassana meditation, then doki meditation.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.000
 Wow, in the teachings, it's like catching fire.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.000
 This has become so powerful.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.000
 But however, in the minute, practice the lineage,

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:29.000
 you always say, samadhi and vipassana meditation

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:34.000
 can go side by side, not just samadhi meditation

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.000
 and vipassana meditation, doki meditation,

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.000
 because you can do both together,

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:43.000
 simultaneously as same as union status,

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:47.000
 because stabilized, when mind is stabilized, stable,

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.000
 that aspect is shamata.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.000
 When you see clearly nature of the mind,

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:57.000
 that aspect is vipassana, and that is doki meditation.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.000
 In the teachings said, those great masters of practice,

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.000
 lineage is always pointed out.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:08.000
 And so therefore, that is sixth cause, sixth grade cause,

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:14.000
 or support for the meditation that I listed.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.000
 Let us know by, I mean, as taught by the Kamala Killer,

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.000
 and that I listed again for more time today.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.000
 And so that's my talk for today.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.000
 And thank you very much again, everyone,

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.000
 for your participation, and as well as your patient,

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.000
 and thank you again.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:31.000
 Thank you very much.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.000
 Now we begin to do a good practice.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.000
 As we said at this time, our schedule is so high,

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.000
 definitely, so we won't do the meditation.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:45.000
 We're going straight into the meditation of vikilization,

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.000
 vikilization.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:49.000
 So this vikilization, meditation of the practice,

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.000
 such as what we do in the healing meditation,

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.000
 it is also meditation.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:55.000
 It's not just a calling of any other teaching,

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.000
 there is a true meditation.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:01.000
 Silence meditation, meditation, also doki meditation,

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:06.000
 and doki meditation with the vikilizations,

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.000
 all the Vedayana teachings, and that is in the health,

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.000
 such as any deities, such as Vedekalayas,

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:16.000
 all the higher givers, Gurbamasa, Tharas,

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:19.000
 who has a Tharachatakas, whatever the vikilization,

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.000
 that is, is also meditation, union with it,

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:27.000
 meditation with it, relative truth and absolute truth.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:32.000
 Relative truth is already purity as divine mandalas,

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:38.000
 all that divine mandala form, and nature is a great emptiness

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.000
 of the blissfulness.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.000
 It's all great blissfulness, emptiness, realization, meditation.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:48.000
 So these are the Vedayana practices that were meditation.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.000
 Now we started doing this with the healing meditation,

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:55.000
 and now we do, again, as this is the,

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.000
 today we do, start with it, go with it,

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:02.000
 or give them our practices, like that, as we did before, straight,

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:07.000
 and then after that, we are going to do dharmapam, medit practices,

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:12.000
 practices, and then, then dedicate the medit, that's our escape.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.000
 Okay, thank you very much, everyone.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.000
 Again, thank you, thank you, everyone.

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.000
 Thank you.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.000
