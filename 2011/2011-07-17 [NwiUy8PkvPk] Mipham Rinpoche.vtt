00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 The emanation of the great master, Sangiichi, the 25th disciple of the Mipham Rinpoche,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 or one of the foremost disciple of the Mipham Rinpoche, 9th foremost disciple,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 or the heart student of the Mipham Rinpoche.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 Thus, in the teaching, Orpin said, he was also the emanation of the magicians.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 And both ways, he was one of the great masters.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 That is, in a way, and it is very useful, a scriptural, scriptural sport,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 a teaching sport that this master is speaking, because it was identified, recognized,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 predicted in the teaching, therefore he is good.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 And who predicted it? This was renowned as Mirpam Sambo, predicted it many times.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 Seid Nupisheen Durba, Mopamcho, the reincarnation of the Nanachi Sadiichi,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 the named Muhan, who will dispel all the like foreign invaders in the Tibet

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 and will have saved heaven to practices. That's what the teaching said.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 In the teaching, it is true, because when you look at time frames of the Tibet,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.600
 the Tibetans are invaded by foreigners, interrupted completely, harping peace and living standards,

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.000
 as we know.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 That happened about 60 years before, 60 years before, in a way, about that.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 So in the minute teaching, master, you see, many of those great masters came around that time,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 such as Muhan Rinpoche's, First Muhan, First Chinsi.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 And through their blessing, the power, the invasions of the foreign,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 the disturbance of the practice prevented at least over 60 years.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 Then you can read also the colophons of the great masters,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 many prayers of the colophons of the great master, First Chinsi.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 Always he is concerned, worrying about the invaders, debating, going to interrupt this.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 The master, young Muhun, the great young Muhun, do pray, do this prayer, do that prayer.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 You must be important, as he encouraged that.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 And Muhan Rinpoche himself, too, did this.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 So therefore, he was one of the great masters,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 the prayer detected by the guru Muhan Rinpoche.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 Then not just the prayer detected that, but what he was, Muhan Rinpoche.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 That is a big monument. The Muhan Rinpoche is not only a person.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 Because Muhan Rinpoche didn't really go in the academic schools, as many others does,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 to learn all the science, five different sciences, the knowledge.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 He didn't really go for so. He just received transmissions, blessings, only that,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 but didn't already start about that.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 But his knowledge is infinite. It's deep and infinite.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 And all the entire Buddha teaching, all that, there's beautiful stories, one time.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 He is meditating at the Neda Chantu, which is the Isrit Veda, practices.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 And one day he asked his attendants,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 "Could you bring the entire Kadyam that I like to read and I should know?"

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 And these attendants are bringing the Kadyam,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 that means over 100 volumes of the text that he is bringing.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 And Muhan Rinpoche is in a permanent cave. He is reading that.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 But he is reading, the way he is reading, he is just looking forward very roughly,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 and then he is wrapping up that, you know, the Kadyam text.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 It's like this. You know. The Kadyam text is like this.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 So then he is kind of opening and looking forward a little bit,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 and then wrapping up and he is standing back.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 Over 100 volumes like this.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 Then around maybe 60 volumes something, this student asked tomorrow,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 "What are you doing?" He said, "What are you doing?"

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 Because he said, "I mean, it looks like you are not really looking or reading.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 I thought you were going to read and at least read those books through this

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 and then just go by one after another, slowly by slowly."

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 He said, "I am reading. I know all the meanings.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 Every word I don't remember, all the warnings, all that.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 But meaning of this all, I know. You can ask me. You can tell me.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 You can read and ask me all."

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 And this is true, that this student asked, and he knew all the meanings.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 Even he said the warnings are maybe not he remembered.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 But many warnings are remembered from all.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 Memorial body wrote all those books and teachings.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 There is already two volumes.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 It not just went through the research and went to the library and copied that as many of us does.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 It just wrote.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 So that tells the knowledge of the Memorial Memorial,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 which is deep and infinite and sharp and clear.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 Clear.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 Not just only the Buddha's teachings, the medicines and the grammars,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 the language of Sanskrit's and the geometries,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 the chemistries, alchemists, all that he knew.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 He wrote those books and all different asteroids and so forth.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 So therefore, this is the great Master Memorial,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 which is one of the great Master's scholars in the Buddhist historians.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 Then the realization level is very highly realization.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 It's not just academic level, his great scholars.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 But realization, because his reincarnation of the Sanghi-Yeshi

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 and emanation of the great Manjushri, Vastama Buddha Manjushri.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 Therefore, his wisdom is so powerful and the realization is so true.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 And a powerful ability is just.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 And also in the way he said, in the teaching, that when he wrote those books,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 he's not spending writing time all the time, all day.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 In the teaching, the life story, many great Masters used to say,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 so that he writes those only between the period of the practices.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 Otherwise, it's a bad practice all the time.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000
 But during the lunch breaks, some breaks he just writes, and then he leaves.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 Next, he starts, he starts.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 Even if you don't look to the reference, the way he starts, the way he did this.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 This means he has photographic memories in his mind, or his brain, in his heart,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 that he writes.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 This is the great Master.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 You can read those life stories in other books.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 So I'm just highlighting this.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 This is the great Master, that he is the rival of these also particular teachings.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 So therefore, he is.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 Therefore, always in the Nalanda monastery, this writer is authentic.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 This writer is perfect.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 Therefore, we don't need to be doubt and hesitate.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 We can accept with joy, confidence, happy, and observe with this.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 Every words and meaning in our heart and mind.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 That's what he says.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 And that's the reason who wrote this teaching, or who wrote these books.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 Second, then, where this teaching belongs with the categories,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 whether it's for example roughly say, this belongs with the sutra,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 or this belongs with that section.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 So what is teaching?

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 Now, we're going to go into pinpoint, deep energy.
