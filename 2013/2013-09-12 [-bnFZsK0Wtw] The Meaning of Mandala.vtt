00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 What means "Mendalas"? What is the meaning of the "Mendalas"?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 A house of a Buddha? What? A Buddha's house? That's true. Really true.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 Center and surroundings in the Shumkor? Yeah, that's also a true word.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:46.250
 The whole bam, the sphere of the deities, Vajrayavadi's speech and mind and activities and

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.000
 qualities.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:01:01.760
 "Mendalas" is translated into Tibet as "Jangkok". And also "Mendala", in the Sanskrit word "Mendala

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.000
", it has two meanings, I mean two words.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:18.680
 "Mendala" in the teaching said, "Mend" means "mind". The "Dra" is like "maintaining". So it's the

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.000
 meaning of maintaining the mind.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 Meaning of the "Mendala" is the word meaning in the "Sadh" meaning of the "Mendalas".

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:38.610
 My language has many meanings, one after another. Also "Mendala" in the teaching said, means that

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.000
 something that is completed, everything is completed.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 Everything is completed in that case. Everything is completed within "Mendalas".

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.820
 And then Sanskrit meaning also in the teaching said, it has meaning of the circle, round formations

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:02.000
.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 So that means, by the mind, if it is round or circle, what that means. And then in the teaching,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 the commentaries and the teaching said, everything is circled and completed within the mind.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:35.390
 So everything is within the mind, completed. Then with that expanded that within the mind, mind is

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.000
 the source of everything.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 When it's expanded, then it's known as also, it can be as the houses, the deities. It's true.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 Then it's also reflected as the house of the deity or the "Mendala" of the deities. That means,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 what means the "Mendala" is the display of the primordial hostess.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 "Mendala" is primordial hostess. "Veda" is house. And "Veda" is round. Round, it is as a sphere, is

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 also mind, everything is within the sphere of the mind.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:26.960
 Mind and nothing is missing out of that. Then "Mendala" is also symbol of the luxuries. House of

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.000
 the deity is not just poor house.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:44.220
 You can say that the "Sambhokaya" is like one of the richnesses. The mention of the "Sambhokaya" is

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.000
 big and vast and luxurious.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:04:01.010
 So, this house of the deity is totally luxuries. Luxuries of the "Pivostas", "Pivostas" that eman

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.000
ated in the different forms.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:12.600
 Different textures. And this house is also not very empty. Every, just one person, is filled with

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.000
 all the different emanations of the Buddhas.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:25.290
 The "Pivostas" is filled with all the different emanations of the Buddhas. The "Pivostas" is filled

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:26.000
 with all the different emanations of the Buddhas.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 "Mendala" is that means the treasure, the treasure of the nature of the mind that we are opening.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 When we open that treasure of the nature of the mind, then what is happening? Then we begin to see.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.180
 First, it's a treasure. It's not just a treasure we open the "Mendala" itself. But this is, all is

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.000
 already existing "Mendala".
