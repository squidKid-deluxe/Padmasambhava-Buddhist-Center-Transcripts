00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 Thank you very much, everyone. Again, welcome, everyone. Thank you. Thank you. Welcome, everyone.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 Good afternoon. And now, again, I'm going to talk about the teachings of the Japji, the Nuremuti.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:34.740
 And now, I'm going to look at this teaching. Please open up this teaching. The hard advice for the

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:46.000
 14 ones by this individual, go to that teaching.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:56.640
 And we'll go to the point of this, best on this teaching, and then let me explain the teaching from

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.000
 other great teachings.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:15.660
 From the Buddha, God of the Mesopotam, other great masters. This, and so, that's it. So, it's all

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.000
 in combat. I mean, this is a very condensed, very mega, like, and like, teachings, like it.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:27.330
 And so, we talk here, and that we give here, when we talk here, in the fourth line, to take the

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.000
 full advantage of the life that is so difficult to obtain.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:43.360
 And then resolve the pre-wansal, from the author of samsaric sufferings. We went through these

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:51.000
 topics. And how that is? Poor, renounced sachin topics.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:02.700
 We discussed, let me say, about how precious life is. Same time, how difficult to obtain these

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.000
 teachings, or these lives, we discussed.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.970
 Of course, this is the teaching of the great teacher, Buddha Shatamuni. But this is not just his

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:23.000
 teaching. His giving is something different, different realms, or different areas happen.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:34.620
 We will look to our own, this world, that human lives are so special. At the same time, it is less

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.000
 than other populations.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:46.020
 I am talking about the animal realms, than what we can see. Of course, this stress, talking about

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:53.000
 the human population is growing. There is over 4 billion.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:04.940
 But think of how much population of animal realms has. According to the teaching, there is animal

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:11.000
 realms, are underground, above ground.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 There are so many varieties of animals.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:26.360
 And to compare with animal realms and human realms, what the teaching said, animal realm is like

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:32.000
 atoms of earth, dust of the earth.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 And among that, human realms are just dust on our palm nails, that much, small.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.590
 This is, of course, examples. To compare with that, and then according to the teaching, now other

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.000
 realms we don't see.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:02.880
 Hungry ghost realm, we don't see. Animal realms, or sorry, hell realms, we don't see. But according

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:08.000
 to the teaching, it is even more than animal realms.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 So therefore, again, in these old reasons, the British life is so, human life is so spacious.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 Among the 4 billion peoples, how many people are spiritually oriented, even more raised?

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 How many really have genuine thoughts of loving-kind and competing, caring and concerning thoughts

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 for others with soft and kind-hearted persons?

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 How many people? Everything. Among the 400 people, 400 billion peoples.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 To compare with that, spiritually oriented is so small. Among the spiritually oriented people,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.670
 how many people are really keeping the body together, what we are discussing, body together, in the

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:11.000
 heart and mind?

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:20.700
 You all know body together. How many people are really head-thought of the body together, thinking

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.000
 of all living beings?

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 So therefore, when we look that way, it's true, it's not just a making of that.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 It's going rare, in a rare, in a rare, or less, less, less.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:46.430
 And now, for example, all of us, in this one medalla or one in the platform of this town, we don't

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:47.000
 retreat.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:58.170
 Somehow, we are quite oriented with spirituals, and also we are quite oriented with loving-kindness

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:00.000
 and competing.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 And also, we are really thinking about the body together, quite all kinds.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 We are even enjoying that, even though maybe we can't activate the exileism,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 we're wicked, but we're really sincerely chanting those prayers, wishing that every day, maybe.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 Every day, that. It is quite reasonable.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:28.110
 It's not something that we have to feel kind of all-spatial, in a sense of an arrogance, but help

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:32.000
 feel joy and happy, and appreciate it.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:40.310
 But same time, have the courage, commitment, confidence that I'm going to use my spiritual life for

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:42.000
 beautiful purpose,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:49.000
 to benefit to myself, to my family members, my friends, and all the beings.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 That is really so important. So therefore, I'm here, that we have to protect and win it.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 And then we discuss it about samsara has a lot of difficulties. Cause and efforts are inevitable.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 Everything is in permanent states. Those are all known as some ocean of samsaras.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 Those are, even though it's natural, but in a way, we go challenge.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 Always, we challenge with impermanence. We challenge with cause and effort in evidence.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 And we challenge with the difficulties and challenges of samsaras, one after another.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:37.670
 Now, what are we doing here? According to his own communion with the teaching, that we like to

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:40.000
 change that status.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 We like to change our samsara, or this, where we are.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 We like to change. And then how to change that, where we go.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 That is known as going to the nirvana.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 But this samsara, nirvana has a border of samsara, nirvana is nothing any further than anywhere.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 I mean, it's not far. So border of samsara, nirvana is within our mental states.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 One great master, Jambung Mohan, what you said, if you give up, if you finish out, finish it,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 or we completely exhaust of the duality, nirvana is right there.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 The moment we are out of the duality, moment we are out of the cleanings,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:47.000
 that moment you are in the nirvanas, right in the nirvana.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 So border of the beat of the samsara, nirvana is very, very narrow.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 There is actually nothing, no borders. No borders.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 The samsara, what the great master Naludyana said in his teaching, the end of samsara is nirvana.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 The end of nirvana is samsara.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:27.000
 There is no difference, reality, except duality, like ego cleanings.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.000
 When we have that, we are within the border or within the territory of samsara.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000
 When we are processed to remove the duality and the clinging,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 we are processed to go into the territory of the nirvanas.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 We are walking toward nirvanas.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 And of course, for a long time, for many of us, our practice and strength is not so strong.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 So therefore, we are going to back and forth, in a way, lingering back and forth.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:10.000
 But once you reach to the first part, sorry, second part, and then first burning,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 then you really reach the comfortable zone of the nirvanas.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 Until that, we are lingering back and forth.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:29.000
 But every keep the courage and the commitment, joy, and joy for effort.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 When we follow the teaching of the Buddha Chaktamuni and Gurbian Masambha,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
 this is our destination.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 And this is our goal.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000
 Here, we are advancing, we are taking advantage.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 So therefore, with that understanding, then what we do?

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 When we do all that, when we know that, then what?

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 And in the teaching, in Buddha's teaching, you should contact qualified teachers.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 Qualified teaching is very important.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:11.000
 I listed yesterday kind of principle or highlight the qualification that explaining in a tantrum,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:17.000
 as well as in Mahayana, a condensed one by the Shanti Devans.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 So those are the qualifications.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 But again, always in the teaching set, in the degeneration times,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:30.000
 it is difficult to get completely highly qualified teachers.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
 Difficult to find.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:40.000
 As I just studied, I'm sure you remember, I divided, or not I, in the teaching.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
 In the teachings, there are three different teachers.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:52.000
 The ordinary teacher, Bodhisattva's teacher, Buddha's teacher.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:59.000
 We don't have the capability to contact Bodhisattva or high enlightened teachers.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 And we don't have the capability to also contact Buddha, Buddhas.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 But what is our range?

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 Range is the ordinary teacher.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 Even though ordinary teacher should have qualifications.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 And those are the qualifications I listed.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 As again in the teaching set, it is practical instructions of pointing out.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000
 It's difficult to open all that qualifications.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:41.000
 But when you know those qualifications, those individually have 70s, 80 persons,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000
 or 60% qualification, that can be accepted.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:53.000
 The whole mark of the qualification of the teacher, and as well as the student,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:03.000
 is loving kindness, compassion, joy, appreciation, openness mark, and loyalty.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 Mostly, those are the qualifications explained.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
 Also for the student too, and the teacher.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 And if you have that, and then also there will be more contentment.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 Those are qualifications.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000
 Particularly again, qualifications of the student, there is again many, many awkward,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
 two different explanations.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 But the simple one, highlight by the great master, Shanti Deo,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 is one foremost student of the Nagarjuna.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:53.000
 He said, "The qualification of the student summarized is, first is open mind."

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000
 Open, but that means not martialities, this and that kind.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 Very open, neutral mind.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:06.000
 Second qualification is very keen interest,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:12.000
 keen interest of the teachings.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 And third one is important, quite smart, can observe the teaching, can understand.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:34.620
 So that means smart, keen interestings, and open mind are the principal qualifications of the

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:36.000
 students.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 With that, that means qualification of the student,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:46.000
 and then qualification of some degree of the teacher, when they meet,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 then they can really make progress, some degree progress.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 And I told a group of stories of this teacher and the students,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:08.000
 particularly how those great qualification students are contracted with the great masters in HEA,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 and that many of you already know this.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000
 You heard many times, you know that, but I'm going to repeat that again.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 This is, for example, Al-Asi talk about the great master, Narayama.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 Narayama was one of the great masters of the Indian monastery,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 known as the Bukram Shala Monasteries.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 Anyway, he was one of the top scholars, scholars of that monastery.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 In around maybe 10th century or 11th century, around that time.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:57.000
 And, but however, even though he is highly appreciated in the renowned great masters,

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 but yet he always feels that he really likes to meet the qualification

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000
 and observe that knowledge, learn, teaching of the Buddha,

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
 and really observe that in the heart, really, always.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
 And many times, one of those great Indian masters said,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:24.000
 "Oh, this mind is never even able to stay for one moment, or one person,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
 one per second, or one minute."

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
 He says, "It's too difficult to stay in the mind,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 so therefore, I just like to leave this and relax."

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
 He likes to leave to the hermitage,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:44.000
 and then relax and gain the stabilizations of the mind, peaceful mind.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 Those already say that.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
 So similarly, Narayama had that entrance,

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000
 even though he is really one of the great masters or teachers

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 in one of the famous monasteries, scholars.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:05.000
 So he left, left, that monasteries,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
 and then he's searching his teachers, teachers,

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:14.000
 according to the predictions that he finds the great master,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000
 known as Maha Siddha Yogi Siddha Tilapas.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.000
 And so he's looking at Tilapas everywhere.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000
 Very difficult to find that even the many people don't know his names.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 And finally, some individually said, he told Maha Siddha or the Siddha Tilapas.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 And that man said, "Oh, I don't know the Tilapas, Maha Siddha Tilapas,

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 but these others are not so far from where this here is,

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 is known as 'ficial' means 'the love', 'ficial' means 'the love'.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 So then anyway he went to this place, he thought,

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 "Oh, Maha Siddha Yogi, since I've been looking everywhere,

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000
 I didn't find anything, so I'm going to go to meet him."

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:17.000
 So when he went there, he's eating the fish.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000
 Fish, but each time, one of the strange things,

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.000
 each time he's eating the fish in the teaching, in his stories,

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 he's snapping, snapping.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000
 Looks like fish are kind of in the back to life, looks like.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000
 He did kind of interesting something, something going on there.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000
 So he kind of asked, I used Maha Siddha Tilapas,

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 and he said, he answered, "I'm the Tilapas."

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
 He said, "I'm the Tilapas, Tilapas."

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000
 And then he's also not really communicating so much.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
 But anyway, he feels something so special,

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000
 so he contacted with this one and followed with that.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000
 And as you all read, and we all read,

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 that Tilapas, when he put Naropa, so many tests, one after another,

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:17.000
 big 12 tests, the harsh tests, hard checks,

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000
 and small 12 hard checks he put, one after another.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000
 Each time, it's so difficult to do that,

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000
 but Naropa really gained great confidence.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 He's the master that I'm looking, and I'm going to stay with that.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000
 So when all that one after another,

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:44.000
 and after 24 different difficult hardship tests went through one after another.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:50.000
 And then finally, finally, Tilapas said to Naropa,

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000
 "Naropa, you mustn't go and get water. We will make tea."

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000
 Of course, in ancient times, making tea is not just like here,

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 that if you go in the hotel, you have to make tea by yourself.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.000
 Self or boil the water and make the tea hot drink,

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000
 or I mean like my hot water, hot drinks to make that.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:19.000
 So Naropa went to get the tea, water from the running springs or rocks,

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 whatever he went, and then Tilapas, he told,

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.000
 he will get a pie wood and we make the pie, we have some hot drinks.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.000
 So, Tilapas, Naropa went and got water.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 And bagged, and he was going to put it there.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:42.000
 And that moment, that moment, Tilapas grabbed Naropa's name,

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 and he pulled out his slippers and banged to his poor head or the face so strongly.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:59.000
 And that moment, Naropa fell down as unconsciousness.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000
 And after a while, he gained unconsciousness,

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000
 and the teacher was right there, Tilapas was right there.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000
 And he kind of blessed that.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000
 And that moment, in the teachings, that when we wake up,

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:19.000
 he sees the perfect true nature, exactly as it is.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000
 That's like past Burmese, or the second Burmese,

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000
 or maybe at the Burmese, whatever that is.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.000
 He has really gone completely old in any true nature,

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000
 negative true nature, as it is.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000
 So all this hardship is difficult to invent.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 It is the asset practices.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
 Practices.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:50.000
 And during that time, Naropa never lost his courage,

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000
 commitment, and confidence,

00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:00.000
 and stay in the rhythm, and stay in the cause,

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:06.000
 and never got any wrong misconceptions of the Tilapas.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000
 And Tilapas also knew the capabilities,

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000
 readiness, courage, and commitment of Tilapas.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000
 That's what he went through,

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:21.000
 giving all those, putting all those old tests, hardships, one after another.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000
 So this is also the story of those great masters,

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000
 great students, really a communication and contact,

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:34.000
 even though it looks like externally, very hard-shelled, difficult,

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000
 but reality is the purification.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.000
 Purifying the calmness, purifying the obscurations,

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000
 purifying the duality conceptions,

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:49.000
 discovering any nature in each process, one after another.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:55.000
 And there is this all beautiful stories in the words of my partner teacher.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000
 I'm sure many of you have these books you can read.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:07.000
 And now I'll talk another story of the great Bodhisattvas, Narva.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000
 This is the Buddha's teaching.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:14.000
 And Narva was very, very devoted,

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:20.000
 very enthusiastic to receive Pandya Paravata teachings.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000
 This is the teaching of the Buddha.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.000
 And he already great Bodhisattvas through himself,

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.000
 but yet he like to explore more teachings,

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000
 more understanding, teachings.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:40.000
 So he's searching and looking the great teacher of the Pandya Paravatas.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000
 Everywhere. He's good and fine.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.000
 One time in the sky, sound king said,

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:54.000
 "You go from here about 500 miles,

00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 and there is great Bodhisattvas, known as Chhumpa in Tibet.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.000
 Northern is also in Tibet, Chhumpa. Bodhisattva, Chhumpa.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:12.000
 You go see him. He is the great master of Pandya Paravata.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:19.000
 Don't get any misconceptions of this great master of Bodhisattva, Chhumpa.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000
 See, activate him, receive the teaching.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:28.000
 Go and teach him to receive to this teaching, to this.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:35.000
 When he heard this sound from the sky, he was so happy, so excited.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:43.000
 Then he started walking, walking, walking, and walking.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:53.000
 And then he felt, "Oh, I didn't ask how I can find. How can I find that?"

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:58.000
 He felt a little bit lost, or I didn't ask enough, precisely, questions,

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000
 "Where are these great masters, and how I can find all that?"

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000
 So he was quite upset.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.000
 But again, he is looking and searching.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:14.000
 He was completely thirsty and hungry for to receive Pandya Paravata teachings,

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.000
 and very lonely, and very enthusiastic.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:25.000
 And finally, again, he appeared, the great beings, or the Buddhas, in light.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:30.000
 And he appeared to him, "And you go from here to the east directions.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:36.000
 There is them, Chhumpa, and receive the teachings, all that."

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:43.000
 So he went. On the way, he thought, "Oh, I don't have any offerings to give to this Chhumpa,

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:52.000
 and how I can get some kind of offerings to these great masters."

00:25:52.000 --> 00:26:02.000
 And finally, to make the shorter stories, he was kind of injured, his physical.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.000
 He was injured because of tests by Indra, Indra's courage and commitment.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:17.000
 But when he was injured, he was having those tests by Indra's teachings.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:25.000
 And nearby the city, there is on the top, on the roof, on the balcony,

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:33.000
 there is a very wealthy, young, beautiful daughter of the very, very rich market.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:39.000
 She, with her friends, they were watching on the street what was happening there.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 And there is one young, beautiful man.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:47.000
 And his kind of life went through the physical kind of life,

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:56.000
 difficult because he was demanding something and went through that difficulty, the troubles.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:02.000
 And she was, "Why? He is doing this. Why? What is the reason he has to do this? This."

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.000
 So then afterward, she came closer to him and asked, "What is the reason?"

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:15.000
 And he mentioned, "Because I like to see these great masters to our bodhisattva,

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.000
 but I don't have any offering articles, so I like to get some offerings."

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:26.000
 That's what I went through these physical kind of challenges for that.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:34.000
 And she thought, "Wow, this man is so courageous to see these masters and give some gifts."

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:40.000
 And he's really kind of going to start facing a challenge with his physical, such as like this.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:47.000
 "Maybe I will ask my father to give some offerings to him."

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:52.000
 So then maybe I will go to him to see these great masters too.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:59.000
 And so he went back to prison, her rich father, and asked.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:06.000
 And the father gave the provision, and he got a lot of offering articles also.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:17.000
 Then she told to Bodhisattva, "And now, so I have the offerings, and we'll ask to go together.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.000
 I will see. I will see too these great masters."

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:31.360
 So she and we had all attendance, and together, Bodhisattva normally went and received the

00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:32.000
 offerings

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000
 and received the Pandya Parama, the teachings.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.000
 And the moment we received the Pandya Parama, the teachings from the Chhumpa,

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:45.000
 and that in the teachings said, "He gave so many wisdoms, or so many samadhi powers,

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:50.000
 for the concentration status, one apranad and this, one apranad."

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:55.000
 So this is the really teaching by the great Bodhisattva minions

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:00.000
 of this great enthusiasm master in Bodhisattva,

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:05.000
 noticing how he contacted them.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 Then we talked about a little bit story of the great master, Lungchiba.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000
 Again, of course, Lungchiba is one of the great masters,

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:26.000
 and he is also known as emanation of the great disciple of the Merpe Masamu,

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000
 the Latyampe Masamu.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:38.000
 So he is already in very high enlightened status, but yet, how he contacted his great masters.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:43.000
 And that is, again, Lungchiba was born in a sentient bit.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.000
 So the Tibet and very kind of like everyday families.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000
 When he was with beautiful signs and indications,

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:57.000
 but to make sure Lungchiba went around later,

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:02.000
 like maybe in the late teenagers or in the early 1920s,

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:09.000
 he went to the very few monastic universities in that time in Tibet,

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:15.000
 the monastic universities, the monastic universities, known as sampu nirutok.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000
 He went there.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 He started there, and the Lungchiba was genius.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:31.000
 He became one of the most smartest learning scholars in that monastery.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:37.000
 And even his name became the one who memorized all the Buddha teachings.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000
 He is genius.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:47.000
 But yet, his interest is like to discover his origin and nature,

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000
 and my meaning for these lives.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:56.000
 And being just scholars, great scholars, is just intellectual, he thought.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000
 I like to really explore the meaning of life,

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:08.000
 to absorb this teaching into the heart, and gain enlightenment within these long times.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:14.000
 He heard the reputation and good about his teacher Renzi Kumaradam.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 We did that at Kumaradam.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000
 Quite often he heard that.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:25.000
 So he really felt that I could go to see him and start with his great masters.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.000
 Masters.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:32.000
 At the same time, in the monastery, there is that he had kind of like some difficulties

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:37.000
 with many young other monks, kind of like challenging him, competing him.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:44.000
 A whole story says that the Lungchiba was quite poor and smart.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:52.000
 But many of those young monks, kind of like wild monks, are jealous of these Lungchimas.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.000
 So therefore, it's also very uncomfortable.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000
 So then he left the monastery.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:04.000
 And well, when he left the monastery, this Renzi Kumaradam,

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:10.000
 we did that at Kumaradam, has very beautiful dreams, beautiful dreams.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:16.000
 So Kumaradam told his own personal attendance that,

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000
 "I had a very wonderful dream last night.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:27.000
 Today I will meet my lineage holder, lineage holder.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:37.000
 So I had let him come to direct to me, or whoever comes, let him, them come direct to me."

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:44.000
 So that's what Kumaradam told in the morning, to his attendance.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:50.370
 And there's no one who really came, particularly something that's going to hold the lineage

00:32:50.370 --> 00:32:52.000
 teachings of Renzi Kumaradam.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:33:02.000
 But after noon, a young monk, quite kind of like a young monk, quite poor looking, came.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000
 So that was a Lungchiba.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:10.000
 Lungchiba, as we know, he's already so learned.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.000
 He's the great scholar, top scholar.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:21.000
 But yet he had to receive contract to the teacher, receive the instructions,

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.000
 and activate his realizations.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:31.000
 So he contracted his Kumaradam with a Dara Kumaradam.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:39.000
 A cold teaching, Kumaradam, Lungchiba stayed about six years with Kumaradam.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:47.000
 During that time, Kumaradam generally never stayed one sport for a long time.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:52.000
 Each time, whatever they have, they leave everything behind.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:34:01.620
 His student, himself, and Moo, with just a simple, what's it called, just Moo, that's it, leave

00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:04.000
 everything behind.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:10.000
 That is a little bit known as the Pungdha, which means something that you give up everything.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.000
 Very popular ancient times.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:19.000
 Give up everything and move others wherever they start their life.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.000
 That is actually known as Kontantamat.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:31.000
 Happy, joy, with little, little, not gathering many things.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:37.000
 So leave. And Lungchiba don't have already began with that.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:43.000
 And so the Kumaradam did that, had all his, himself, and all of us are doing that,

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.000
 and it has become more difficult to him.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:53.000
 Lungchiba don't have primarily big sport too, quite far, I guess, and then quite difficult.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.000
 But yet he stayed with Lungchiba.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.000
 Lungchiba stayed with Kumaradam, received all the teachings.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.000
 And the Kumaradam also has the capabilities.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:10.000
 He is the main principal in the order of the ninte, or the ninte,

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:16.000
 the teaching, the jokki teaching, that descended from the Gopi Masambhava, the Valam Matara,

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:22.000
 that all, he can hold very well and transmit that he has the capabilities.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:29.000
 And he was very, very kind and nice and efficient to the Lungchimas.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.000
 And he stayed 20, I mean, six years.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:38.000
 At the end of the, that completed, what did the teaching say?

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:45.000
 Lungchiba told to Kumaradam, I'm so poor, I don't have anything to material offer.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000
 But I put this into the practices, what do you give me?

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.000
 And actually, the realization, I make that offer.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:57.000
 So my practice will be offering to you.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.000
 And in the teaching said, he went to the center of Tibet,

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.000
 known as the Mountain Gangritoka.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:09.000
 It's a very famous program of sports in Tibet.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.000
 When they stayed, in the teaching, the samsit master said,

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000
 about nine years, he practiced and meditated.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.000
 Omenya sams said, three years.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:26.000
 And whatever he stayed, long time he stayed in that mountain.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.000
 Up in the mountain.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:33.000
 And what Lungchiba has taught, one bag, one bag.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:37.000
 As a sleep bag, or like bag.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:45.000
 That is his cloth, that is his meters, or bed, bedding.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.000
 That is the really what he gets.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.000
 But his courage, commitment, devotion, enthusiasm,

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000
 joy for effort, never lingering.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:03.000
 And he stayed, and he became known as Second Garab Dorji,

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.000
 or Kunt Buddha Samadabad.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.000
 Within that, during that time.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.000
 He actualized all the teachings, not just intellectually,

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000
 but now completely discovered.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.000
 The teaching observed, and he become himself

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.000
 as the great master of Dzogchi.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.000
 That Dzogchi.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000
 And he become himself as Dzogchi.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:32.000
 And he discovered the innate primordial vegetables

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.000
 and reached the enlightenment within that single,

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:42.000
 whether it's three years, nine years, whatever, in that time.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.000
 That was how he stayed.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.000
 His food is so little during that time.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:53.000
 He really saw Samadabad, every three years.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:58.000
 So small, so small among the food.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:02.000
 And some kind of vitamin builds or market builds,

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.000
 and the teaching said, but it's small.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.000
 And he was relieved.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000
 So this is the story of Dzogchi,

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000
 how he contracted and how he observed it,

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.000
 how he maintained courage and commitment,

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.000
 joyful effort, and devotion through that.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.000
 Then he actualized the realization

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.000
 as the great Dzogchi.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000
 And master Dzogchi.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.000
 And then the similar story of Malareba.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.000
 Again, the same thing.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.000
 Malareba is born as quite a wealthy family,

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000
 the golden teaching,

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:44.000
 the very Canadian Galatia, the mountain Galatia region.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.000
 Quite wealthy.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.000
 But however, young time, his father was lost.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.000
 And mother and him and his sisters suffered

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:59.000
 and kind of put so much trouble by their relatives.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.000
 And not just relatives, all neighborhood,

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:05.000
 whole village turned against them without any reason.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.000
 Reason, reason.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.000
 And when you might suffer in the difficulties.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.000
 And that suffering and difficult trouble that he went,

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.000
 that didn't perish in his commitment,

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.000
 his hope, his vision, his vision.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000
 Dzogchi created Toma.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.000
 Toma and kind of lost the identity.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:30.000
 In a way, it's activated his courage and commitment

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:35.000
 as like volcano rock, volcanoes in undergrounds.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:39.000
 Then, because of encouragement of mother,

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:42.000
 and did all that he achieved,

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.000
 like black maggies, all those powers.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.000
 And very soon, he was also a genius,

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.000
 even though Malareba didn't go to school at academic levels,

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.000
 but he was a genius and very highly intelligent person.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.000
 He got all those powers and performed with the mother.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:03.000
 Again, he failed, I mean, he's not just failed,

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.000
 he created many negative ideas.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000
 One after another.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.000
 And that, again, feels so kind of like,

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.000
 he feel bad about that.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.000
 And he did it again, lost his identity.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000
 Because of that, he thought,

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.000
 I'm going to change my directions.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:27.000
 And that great commitment is in heart and mind,

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:30.000
 and he met great Doki masters.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.000
 And that Doki master told,

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.000
 you are not my kind of like connected,

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.000
 I'm not your connected teacher, go to Simaba.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.000
 And he went to the Malareba.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000
 And then Malareba put again so many difficult one up and the other.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:51.000
 That old did not perish in his whole vision, goal, identity.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:56.000
 In a way, it is kind of making more his courage and commitment.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:01.000
 More stronger, really stronger, more uplifting,

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.000
 very kind of like determination, commitment,

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.000
 he'd like to make difference.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.000
 Finally, Marva gave the teaching and all that,

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.000
 and then Malareba become as one of the great yogis

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.000
 in the Buddhist historicals,

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.000
 or a chi man, great historicals.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.000
 This is all the different stories.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:24.000
 And then you read life story of the great master

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.000
 such as Papa Ramochas.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.000
 And the great master Maphong Ramochas,

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.000
 great master of the Jungkook Oondra.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.000
 And of course, the Chinsi,

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.000
 their life story, how they are humble, simple,

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.000
 don't do the art, yet they're so committed,

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.000
 courage and commitment.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.000
 They never kind of like stopping the practicing dharma,

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.000
 even though they're high in the realization of beings.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.000
 And they're never stopping to the like,

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.000
 say, "Oh, it's enough and I don't need,

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000
 I reject that teaching, I reject that."

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.000
 They resist all the teaching in the practice,

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:01.000
 each other in the honor and glory of mind,

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.000
 and they're sitting down to the earth

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:06.000
 and kind of humbly themselves.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.000
 This is the really all these great masters,

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.000
 all the other disciples of each other's.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.000
 How they are?

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.000
 Raw examples of all the practices.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.000
 So therefore, when we have the teacher,

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.000
 when we have the teaching, when we have the pressure of this life,

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:28.000
 and now it's ready to act like some meaningful of these lives,

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.000
 of the spiritual side, not material side.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.000
 Material side we already have, you already have,

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.000
 but we all have really, really,

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.000
 but something kind of tangible develop

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.000
 that we can develop with our heart and mind.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:48.000
 So that will stay a long time.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.000
 For that reason, what I said,

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:54.000
 good practitioners, when we started practicing,

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:59.000
 meditating and developing our mental state, mind state,

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:03.000
 that is the beginning of joy and peace.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.000
 Beginning of joy and peace.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:12.000
 The beginning becomes more happier later than now,

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:18.000
 and more happy before we depart,

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.000
 our physical more happy than even before.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.000
 So it's like, for example,

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.000
 if we divide our life now and between,

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:29.000
 and then next time we leave this world,

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:33.000
 understand that by practicing, our life will be happy now,

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:37.000
 but it will be more happy after three years.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:43.000
 It will be more, more happy than after seven years, then more.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.000
 And it will be more happy in the comfortable,

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.000
 even more happy in the pardo in this lifetime.

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:58.000
 And even more happy, more comfortable than in the pardo.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:02.000
 Next lifetime is more happy than the pardo.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:08.000
 Those are the teachings, from the happy, going from happy to happy,

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:12.000
 or going from peaceful, to peaceful, to peaceful,

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:15.000
 to the great peaceful states.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:19.000
 That is the relief of the practicing, the dharma,

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:24.000
 and the practicing, developing the strength with our mental state.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:28.000
 And that is my talk again today, and it's been a little longer,
