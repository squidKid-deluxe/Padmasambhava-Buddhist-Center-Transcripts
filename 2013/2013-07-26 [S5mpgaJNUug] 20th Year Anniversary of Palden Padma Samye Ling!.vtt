00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.400
 "Tackles" and so beautiful, yet it's almost kind of out of our reach, how to do these things.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:15.700
 And finally, again, Bill Herman, Lars, David, and along with then Carlos, and Carlos's wife,

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.600
 they all have been supportive to this and come so beautifully with that.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.600
 So, and then, plus more, you all, everyone is here, really have the support.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.600
 I won't go through this long list and all that,

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.000
 but because of everyone's support and help, this came.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.400
 So, thank you very much, it's here.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.000
 And everybody, Kainji Padma Samye Ling, and myself, we've always said that,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.800
 what you help and support is here, as well as in India and everywhere is here.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:53.000
 And you can feel this, you build this too, Father, this is not just one or two, three individuals.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 Everybody can think this is their monument and your monument.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.800
 And through love and compassion and wisdom, there is every reason we can dedicate this merit for

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.200
 larger reasons,

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:12.000
 such Buddha enlightenment and to benefit and to bring the peace and harmony in the world.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.400
 So, this is what it is, and thank you again.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.800
 Thank you and happy Annamasuri.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.800
 Thank you very much, Samye Ling. Thank you.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:41.400
 (Applause)

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.200
 Thank you. Happy Annamasuri.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.200
 Happy anniversary.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.400
 (Applause)

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.240
 Thank you.
