00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.880
 This is the visualization practice of the Vajrasattva practice. The Vajrayana teaching always said

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:21.490
 two practices, visualization and completion stage practices, all the dissolving stage practices,

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.280
 first we visualize.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:30.320
 That means transforming everything, both the environment, including our body, in the environment of

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.800
 the Vajrasattva, pure mandala.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:39.780
 Your body is yourself with Vajrasattva and your perception and conception, all these in Vajrasattva

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.200
 status. So that's where we begin.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.920
 And that is why we do this practice. According to the teaching of the Buddha and the Vajrayana

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.480
 teaching, reality level, the nature is already enlightened status.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.220
 Everything is, all the five elements are the five female Buddhas, five aggregators are the five

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.630
 male Buddhas and there is nothing else besides the combination of the five element and the five

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:04.640
 aggregators.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.880
 So everything is the display of the divine mandalas. So really we are activating that realization.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.480
 We know the burial or the hindrance of the dualities.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:21.130
 That is the part of the meditation of the Vajrayana. Immediately you are be in the Buddha status,

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.480
 not just waiting Buddha long way in the future, you just become now Buddha.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:32.990
 That is what the powerful Vajrayana teaching is, in particular, in a tantra. So we are part of the

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:39.860
 inner tantra, part of the secret Vajrayana teaching, we are visualizing and ourselves will be that

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:40.480
 status.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:47.190
 To become our, that status, then always in the teaching you say, be courageous one, be courageous,

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.480
 fearlessness.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:55.070
 Don't interfere in your realization meditation with intellectual ideas and skeptical hesitation

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.480
 without, those are obstacles.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:03.480
 It is undermining our quality of the nature of the meditation. Be in that status for a short time.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:10.650
 You have, you can do intellectual, we can do intellectual things and analyze all those things after

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.480
 meditation practice, before the meditation practice.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:20.570
 But during the meditation practices we start thinking this and that, that is then just discursive

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:21.480
 thought.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:29.800
 And is it disturbance? So therefore, distancing those courage and confidence, what we need, joy,

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.480
 devotion, confidence and appreciation.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.310
 How fortunate we are that we have such a great teaching of the lineage teaching of that we can

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.480
 really embrace and kind of reveal our nature.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.820
 It's not just so accidental, it's not just seldom kind of happen by itself. Truly we are fortunate

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:48.480
 beings.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:55.470
 That's what the Buddha said, to being as a human being is so special, so rare. We are human beings,

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.480
 not just human beings.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:03.780
 We have the 18 endowments, 10 lakshas call it us. And add freedom and 10 lakshas call it us, we

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:04.480
 have that.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:10.900
 And all this wonderful, and plus not just that, and such a great teaching of the Buddha, Vaidyana

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.480
 teaching by Gurbel Masambhav.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.480
 And all these great master of the kama and the dharma teachings, now really we can embrace in that.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.480
 This is all those great master, what we call, reaching enlightenment, become this great master

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.480
 because of doing these practices.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:31.760
 It's not just they are born with great masters. They practice, they meditate, they actualize with

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.480
 courage and commitment, confidence, joy, devotion, and both each other.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.480
 Don't to the earth, they really reach that realization. That's what we always approach.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:47.550
 We are in that footsteps. We are following the same nectar, the drink, and the same pot that

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.480
 follows, and the same call it us, same thing we have.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:58.100
 And this is so special. So therefore, and then also so many beautiful other call it in samsara,

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.480
 that you all have.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:05.480
 In samsara, every lakshas call it us, you have. In this country, many. So it's not just co-exident.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:12.480
 Both samsara level and the dharma level, we are very fortunate ones. Brain joy, appreciation.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.210
 That's what we are going to also, by thinking of, bring out those call it us, we are going to

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:20.480
 remove our suffering, the difficulty, troubles, challenges.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.550
 We are going to transform that. That's what also known as bodhisattvas. Courageous ones for the

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:26.480
 enlightenment.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.480
 Bodhisattva means Sanskrit. Courageous ones for the enlightenment.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:36.480
 We are going to transform all the challenges, the difficulties, troubles on the way into the path

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:43.340
 so that it ignite our courage, our commitment, our confidence, our destination, and we are

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.480
 advancing.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.480
 Those are all important. That's part of the practice.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:56.840
 So again, back to these practices, we are practicing, following that. In Vedayana teaching, there

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:02.480
 are two practices, principal practices, visualization and the dissolving or the completion stages.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:09.480
 This is visualization. We are going to see ourselves as Vedasapras, instant in April.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:14.700
 And those old structures, so clearly here, this is one of the great master's teaching of the Nirma

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:15.480
 schools.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:22.480
 Great Tirtha lumba or Vendolethi. It's very powerful. It's so powerful practice.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:28.480
 This teaching is practiced by so many Buddhist practitioners in Tibet, but regularly in Nirma.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:34.480
 All Nirma schools, really they practice this. And then as well as Gaju tree and Mene Sathya too.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.480
 So this is very powerful practices, and we are really connected to that.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:43.480
 So again, this is your joy, devotion, bodhicata, and appreciation.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:49.920
 Those are the foundation of the Dharma. Those are the central column of Dharma, and those are the

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.480
 result of Dharma.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:56.480
 We start that now. Now. So bring out the fruitful qualities, and then we follow that.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:03.480
 We follow that. Just again, simple reminder again. That's what the teaching says.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:09.480
 Sangha means helping and support to each other. We are all as Sangha members.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:17.180
 So I'm just reminded, I'm staying on this chair and kind of playing the role of the S like ceremony

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.480
, like that.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:24.480
 So I'm just really reminding to you in a way. Reminding to you and reminding to me too.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:31.480
 So we all be in this beautiful status and bring up this beautiful attitude, as I said many times.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.480
 Thank you again. So now we follow these steps.
