00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.350
 This teaching, as I said, is the teaching of the Buddha, and then this teaching of Dangarapayam Mas

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:16.000
ambha.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 And the Buddha who came, of course, many of you know, who came 2,500 or 600 years ago,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.190
 and he gave many different teachings. After his enlightenment, he reached the Enlightenment at age

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:33.000
 35.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:42.760
 After that, he gave four major seminary teachings, and those are known as the first turning wheel

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:43.000
 of Dharma,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.240
 second turning wheel of Dharma, and then third turning wheel of Dharma, and then fourth turning

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.000
 wheel of Dharma in some cases.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 And the first, second, and third teachings are only known as the basic Buddhism teaching,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 or many times known as the sutra teachings, the causal teachings many times.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 What that means, causal teachings, means Buddha giving the teachings of the cause and conditions,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 and how to bring the result from the cause, gradually how to develop that.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 Cause, we all have the cause. Cause of the teaching or cause of the Enlightenment is we all have.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:50.340
 Those are known as Buddha nature, or basic, our spiritual qualities, basic nature that we all

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.000
 inherited.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 But that cause is not enough, as you all know, we all know.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 Even we have the cause, cause is not enough. We need other supports.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 Other supports are known as then, conditions.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:21.020
 Cause and condition when it meet in the perfect ways, and then result comes inevitably, and result

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.000
 comes also gradually.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 We have to cause and condition get together, once get together, that's not enough.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 We have to continue to preserve, protect, watch, and then we have to do that.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:49.560
 In order to do those, then, what we call spiritual, dharma, joy, devotion, joy for effort, those

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.000
 all need it.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:59.370
 This is not just a spiritual debt, but when we plant the seeds on the farmland, even in farmers

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.000
 have to put effort,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 even maybe they don't use the devotion, joyful effort, and so forth, but they have to put effort.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:18.360
 Effort, and to continue to look after what they planted, and that looking after those is in the way

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.000
 of conditions.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 Continue to support, and then bring the result, and those then in the result is inevitable.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 We don't have to doubt, hesitate, it will not come.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:41.120
 We look after carefully, every part of it, there's conditions existing and applied, the result

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.000
 comes inevitably.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 And that is law of nature.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 This, everybody knows, and that's why the farmers planted.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 They don't have to be, farmers don't have to be educated, going to school in many ways.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 In ancient time, of course, modern time, maybe there's all those different things,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:11.350
 but that is the basic survival, basic intelligence, continuing until now, the farmers grow the

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:12.000
 seeds,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 and then develop that they do that all the time, and that they know that, there's no need to doubt.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 And similarly, the Buddha gave the teachings in the sutra, how to apply the conditions,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 how to look after our beautiful seeds, after beautiful nature, and bring growth.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 This Buddha-natural growth, what Buddha gave in the sutra teaching, is joy.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 It's uplifting, it's rewarding, it's so special, each step is joyful steps.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:57.460
 Each moment is joy, because we are touching something so important, our inner goal, and bring

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:58.000
 growth.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 It brings beauty, beauty of ours.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:09.250
 Not just only that, when we came to growth of our inner, these qualities, then it brings joy and

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.000
 happiness to the others too.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:20.490
 And that teaching is known as, then, gradually developing and discovering, full it is ultimate blus

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.000
um, call it this.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 And this is known as causal teachings, because it's kind of like developing gradually and closely.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 And that is most of the time, I mean not most of the time, it's called sutra teachings.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:46.250
 That is in Buddhism, terminology. Sutra. Sutra is again, many of you heard this, but all sutra

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.000
 means condensate.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 Because this sutra teaching, Buddha gave the teaching, is not scattered teachings.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 Scattered in bits and different jicapasas that are scattered all out.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.980
 But put all so perfectly beautiful in the teaching, teaching the techniques and important

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:06.000
 guidelines,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 and step by step put together as a condensate, so the manual that we can put easily to the practice

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 and use that.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:24.000
 That's what is known as sutra. Sutra means condensate, gathered, more precisely.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 And those are the causal teachings.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:37.770
 Then the fourth teaching, I said today, the fourth teaching is known as the result teaching, result

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:40.000
 teaching.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:50.640
 What it means is result, in the cause, as I said, in the causal, we will gradually look into the

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:51.000
 seeds

00:06:51.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 and protecting, preserving, and then gradually we kind of bring up growth, that's the causal.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 But the result, we're looking direct to the result itself, the fruit itself, the final goal itself.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:23.660
 We're not looking waiting for the graduation, we're instantly jumping, instantly targeting to the

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:25.000
 goal itself.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 The final goal, the result, the result is what?

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 It's enlightenment, or result is a waking call, the full awakening state. That is a result.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 And full awakening is called buddha, in Sanskrit, in Tibet, it's a sanjic.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:08:02.740
 The fully awake, there's no blood, no shadow, no stains, no any kind of extra package that's

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:06.000
 hanging out of that and dragging down that.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:17.490
 It's a full blink, brilliant, waking call that instantly you are focused on that. And that is

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:19.000
 result.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:28.020
 And that teaching, or that technique that we're explaining is called tantra, tantra teaching,

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:31.000
 mantra teaching, vedayana teachings,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 o tantra, mantra, vedayana. Vedayana, of course, many of you have heard that,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 vedayana is diamond uplifting, diamond uplifting, call it this.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 It's a diamond path. It's fast, speed, and comfort, and then quick, and discovering that, call it.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 That is called diamond yana, or diamond uplifting status, lift by diamond call it this.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 And that is the result, result yana, or result, result.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:24.000
 So this teaching, what we're going to focus this week is vedayana teachings, vedayana teaching,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 mantra teaching, and then tantra teachings.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 And what this means, mantra, of course, many of we all know mantra, something that we join, recite,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 recite that everybody kind of thinks that that's the mantra, that's true, that's the mantra.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:10:01.510
 But really mantra means it's transforming the consciousness, or transmitting the consciousness, and

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:03.000
 that is mantra.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:11.160
 Man and the mantra in Sanskrit world, there's two word, man. Man is actually every kind of roughly

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:14.000
 translated, is mind.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:26.790
 Tera is protecting. Tera is protecting. So what it protects, technique that protects the

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:36.580
 consciousness or emotion consciousness, emotion consciousness, or technique that will protect this

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:43.000
 conception is not become wild.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:55.000
 That's called mantra. And tantra, again, is Sanskrit world.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:11.510
 And again, this tantra, tantra means continuation, continuation, something continuation, unblocked,

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:16.000
 uninterrupted, something continuing.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 Today, we are reconnecting to that continuation, to that continuation.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:36.360
 And that is, what is that continuation? That is, again, our inner nature of this mind or nature of

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.000
 intelligence.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:51.000
 Our inner intelligence, this brilliant, bright intelligence that we all have.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:12:09.580
 It's not just newly arrived. It's not just newly came here by accidentally. But it's something

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:10.000
 continuation. It's continuation.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 It's continuity from the timeless times. It's continuing now.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:30.760
 But even it's continuing now, continuing from the timeless times, and continuing now, we did not

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:35.000
 recognize.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 And we not aware that, even slightly, we didn't aware that, just even though it is with us.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:13:03.960
 But this teaching is pointing out that continuation and bring back us to that nature, nature as it

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.000
 is.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 And why we are not continuing, why we didn't aware this? This is our duality, our grasping.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 We continually project externally, outwardly, and we're catered with this outer. Outer, we really

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 didn't slightly experience of the inner discontinuations.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 But this teaching is immediately reconnected back to that continuation, nature.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 And that explain, this teaching, that explaining fully it is, this quality, how to connect it back.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:05.000
 This is called, then, Dantara teachings. That's called Dantara, it's continuation.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:13.500
 So this means, Dantara teaching is, means again, is our inner nature, immediately connected back to

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:14.000
 us.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:21.300
 Not just a wedding, but really instantly connected to it is natural, introducing, pointing out, and

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:23.000
 then be with that.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:29.000
 And this is, is home sweet home. Home sweet home.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:35.980
 That you're connected back to that politics, instantly. Until now, we're not, we're always looking

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:42.000
 out, and went out, and we never really thought of our home sweet home.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:59.490
 You just always, we are, kind of like, carried with, out force. The force of the conception, force

00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:01.000
 of the perceptions, force of this duality, duality that expanded out, and we continually pursue.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:08.480
 And today is going, connected back to that nature, instantly, quickly pointing out, and to that,

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:10.000
 and be with that.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000
 And grew with that. Be with this, enjoy with this.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:21.000
 And this is what, known as, means, Dantara. Dantara means.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:35.000
 And then, Vedayana, that we all basically know. Vedayana. Vedayana is the, like, diamond, I think.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:46.000
 And yana is weaker. Weaker, or diamond, diamond, lifting. Lifting, instantly.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:54.450
 And diamond, generally, again, it means, once you realize this nature, or once you apply this

00:15:54.450 --> 00:16:07.000
 technique, it transcendent everything into the ordinary natural status, status, or wisdom status.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:15.000
 And natural, it cannot be destroyed and interrupted by any means. Means, it's like diamond.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:25.650
 That, again, is our nature. Our nature of this mind, nature of this qualities, quality of the mind,

00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:29.000
 cannot be destroyed by any means.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:39.290
 It is like, it is diamond, indestructible status. And yet, it contains all the purity status, all

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:43.000
 the quality of the enlightenment, it has.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:52.770
 And that is, again, is about our one's own nature. This nature of the mind, nature of the

00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:58.000
 consciousness, and nature of these realities.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:06.220
 This cannot be destroyed, yet it can transcendent everything into its ordinary status. Therefore,

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:14.000
 it is powerful, lifting, powerful teaching, and this is what is called Vedayana teaching.
