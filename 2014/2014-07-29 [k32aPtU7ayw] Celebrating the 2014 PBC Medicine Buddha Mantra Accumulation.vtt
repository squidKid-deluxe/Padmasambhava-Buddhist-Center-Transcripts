00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200
 "Every year, so many years, we had a great opportunity to accommodate the mantras of the different

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:07.780
 Buddhas,

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:14.700
 and they're getting a different kind of like, highlight that in different kind of purposes for

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.220
 everything,

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:21.040
 but they highlighted that. And this year, we decided, or we thought, to really accommodate the

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.320
 mantra of the medicine Buddhas.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:35.340
 And also to kind of like, to complete it that this next week, and for the Choongkoro Duchen,

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.660
 which is the Buddha's turning wheel of Dharma in the first time in Sarnath, the application of

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:41.340
 enlightenment,

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:48.420
 according to Ben Karand, I think it falls next week. So we really thought to accommodate that and

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.340
 the medicine Buddha.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.810
 And then of course, this year, the other medicine Buddha is not just only about the sicknesses of

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:54.360
 persons,

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.360
 but there's so many purposes in this world, rather than having experience of the difficult troubles

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.360
 and sicknesses,

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:06.500
 related with a lot of kind of unquerable sicknesses, so many things. And then the physical, and

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.360
 then of course, mentally, emotionally,

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.490
 and then, and of course, medicine Buddha is also known as the medicine Buddha, to cure the root of

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:14.360
 the sicknesses,

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:20.020
 which is in the Buddha teaching, is three poisons, and ignorance, and attachment, anger, and all of

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.360
 that.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:27.040
 Even though in the Koda Duking level, that we deluded this world from the ignorance, and this sams

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.360
ara is continually with that.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.660
 And then he asked when people use the metaphor, the waves and the tides of this, all the different

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.360
 emotions are kind of arising and coming,

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.360
 and they're collapsing each other, and then we are experiencing of all these things.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:46.360
 So this is what's really so special to enjoy, the mantra and meditation.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.360
 Of course, all the practice dedicated that marriage to every living being to remove the suffering.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.360
 And as we discuss it, then definitely it will help to the other beings as much.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.360
 Even it didn't help immediately, but it will help us. It's open our heart and our mind.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.550
 That's the body. That's what we're talking about, the poor, boneless, boneless love, boneless,

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.360
 completely boneless, joy and the economy.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.360
 Our heart is open, and we're not thinking it's going to help immediately.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.360
 That question is, we're not going, we're going to help to the beings and help.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.870
 And we have that outreaching pull and pull, intention to that. Definitely it will help in the

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.360
 benefit of inspiring to them then,

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.360
 and remove the suffering difficulties.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.360
 So therefore, again, just with thought to accommodating these mantras,

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:45.360
 and so you can also use your spare time to practice, and talk with meditation.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.360
 I mean, meditation and repetition of the mantra, of the meditation Buddha or any mantra,

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:55.360
 is not separate from the silent meditation, relaxed, zoki-state meditation.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.360
 And the Buddha, the Buddha is meditating in the zoki-state.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.360
 And join with that and meditate ourself with the right in front of the meditation Buddha,

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.360
 with the zoki-state meditation or relaxing calm and vipassana meditation,

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.360
 or the Mahamudar meditation, or the Madhyamaka meditation.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.360
 And that is what all is just the same nature in the teaching state.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.360
 It's the same thing, different titles, but basically, it's the same.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.360
 So there in that natural state, we join with that and meditate with the compassion thought,

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.360
 and igniting that our love, and the compassion, the healing energy of love and compassion,

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.360
 with the blessings of the meditation Buddha,

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:40.360
 spread out to the whole universe and beyond that is one of the very special meditation things.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.360
 So I just like to encourage.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.360
 So this is an upstate?

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.360
 An upstate, right?

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.360
 On the third floor, we have beautiful temple.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.360
 I mean, you know that.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.360
 So here we have, kind of feel that.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.360
 It will be open for practice.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.360
 Yeah, open for practice.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.360
 Please.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.360
 Okay.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.360
 Thank you.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.360
 Here we go.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.360
 (Applause.)
