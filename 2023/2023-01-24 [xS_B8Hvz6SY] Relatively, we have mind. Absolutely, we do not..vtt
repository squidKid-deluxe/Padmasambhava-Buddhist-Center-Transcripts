Among these, in the Vajrayana, connecting to your teacher is essential to invoke the power and beauty of the nature of mind. Therefore Guru Rinpoche gave many teachings on how to practice on Guru Padmasambhava, many of which were hidden by the wisdom dakini Yeshe Tsogyal.\n\nThis particular terma was revealed by the famous terton Tsasum Lingpa in the 17th century, and is considered one of the blessed and powerful practices for connecting to Guru Rinpoche as a sambhogakaya emanation known as Guru Vidyadhara. This terma is a condensed practice of all three Inner Tantras of Mahayoga, Anuyoga, and Atiyoga.\n\nThe Dzogchen teachings are the highest and most direct teachings of the Buddha Shakyamuni on the nature of mind. They show us how to discover our own inner beauty and realize everlasting peace for ourselves and all beings. Ven. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche will give these rare and essential heart instructions according to the great master Shechen Gyaltsab Gyurme Pema Namgyal Rinpoche. These direct and profound teachings impart the critical points and central supports for all practitioners to maintain to keep our practice fresh, alive, and beneficial for everyone.\n\n\u201cIn brief, to recognize your own nature is the view.\nWhen you abide within it, that is the meditation.\nAnd if you have no attachment, that is superior conduct.\nWhen you arrive at the primordially free fundamental nature, that is described as the fruition.\nAll are included in the natural state beyond concepts.\u201d\n\nShechen Gyaltsab Gyurme Pema Namgyal Rinpoche (1871-1926) was the reincarnation of Orgyen Rangjung Dorje, and was the fourth regent of Shechen Monastery. Shechen Gyaltsab was the disciple and heart-son of Mipham Rinpoche. He also studied closely with the First Great Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo and the First Great Jamgon Kongtrul Rinpoche, among many other extraordinary Nyingma and Sarma masters. He focused for many decades on the key points of Creation and Completion Stage practices. Shechen Gyaltsab excelled in all three activities of the learned--exposition, debate, and composition--undertaking the three practices of listening, reflecting and meditating for his own benefit, and the three activities of teaching, debating and writing for the benefit of others.\n\nVen. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche is a holder of the complete Buddhist Nyingma lineage of study and practice. He was enthroned by H.H. Dudjom Rinpoche as a Nyingma Abbot. As an accomplished scholar and Vajrayana master, Rinpoche has an amazing ability to convey profound topics simply and directly, making the rich, vast ocean of Dharma accessible and easy to put into practice.\n\nwww.padmasambhava.org\nwww.pbdc.net",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.240
 No mind is where we invite all into it, in absolute truth. Related truth, we have mind. Related

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:17.280
 truth, we have mind. What related to the mind we have is not solid existing mind, it's magical

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.580
 displays.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:25.780
 Ellusion. Those we discussed in the great master's room, Timbar 32, have that developed in the

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:31.890
 space of the Dharma Dato or the Datta Kata Garva, and the clothes of the mistress of the duality or

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.160
 the inner horizon, and then all the medicinal dualities are kind of created.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.620
 And then more details on those of you all know, those are the three habit dependence, habit

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.420
 dependence of the land or the subject, object, habit dependence of the subject,

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:55.050
 and habit dependence of the usage. Those are all, and I'm highlighted those we all know. That all

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:02.970
 is related to. Related truth is not solid existing, it's component, it's impermanent, it's inter

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.020
dependent coordination, it's magical displays, it's illusion.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:14.860
 Again I'm talking illusion, I mean you know that illusion is not something bad, bad. This is just

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:21.840
 the way things are. Even ourselves, it's like illusions, boring, really dream like boring, it's

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.820
 here, but it's not going to last forever.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:32.350
 It's all, that is relative truth. The absolute truth is beyond the existing, non-existing, all of

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:40.150
 them. At that level, then, mind, there's no substantive, existing mind, no mind. That's what we're

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.720
 talking. So there's no mind.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:50.860
 That's it. We went through those and I let it go away too. There's no, we didn't find mind. And you

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:58.370
 know too. We went yesterday and really said, "Where come from? Where is mind? Where is the same

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:59.120
 mind?"

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:07.080
 On the relative level we have the mind. Those are in the teaching, all of them said relative truth

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:14.780
 existing perfectly, beautifully when we don't investigate, analyze, analytic put. We don't put

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.020
 analytic. Isn't it?

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:25.060
 But when you put analytic, analyze, sharp knowledge of your own intelligent Muslim, then relative

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:32.980
 truth is in a very caring way. In a debate, relative truth is known as kunzo. Kunzo means, kun

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:41.020
 means all, zom is illusion. Illusion is all illusion.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:50.890
 Then kunzo never, never made truth. So truth of illusion, the truth of all illusion. Why is it said

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:56.460
 to look truth? Because when we have duality level, when we have duality, when we don't, it's

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.020
 functioning perfectly.

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:08.200
 Perfectly relative truth, even is illusion. Illusion is perfectly punctuating exactly what it has

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:19.320
 to do. Such as fire heats up what it leaves. And the wind blooms. Art keeps the solid. Art makes

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.020
 the best.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:48.470
 Similarly, all this evolves perfectly, therefore it is called the truth. We have left all illusion

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:49.100
 truth. And that which translated into English, relative truth, I believe, that's it. And the tonda

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.670
 demba, in the second truth, absolute truth, tonda demba, all in the supreme, absolute, supreme

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:50.020
 truth.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:04:00.490
 Absolute supreme truth is, absolute truth cannot be defeated by anyone, not duality, not even

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:10.020
 anyone's. It's there. But it's there, not there as existing, non-existing level, magic level.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:19.130
 As we discovered from looking, taking from our mind, mind is here, inevitable. We have, we have

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:28.740
 mind. But then there is, there's nothing really in the location, identity, anything. Those are

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:35.020
 known as the pre from the birth, pre from the identity, pre from the cessation.

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:42.800
 It's true. It's not just making up the stories by Buddha and just trying to kind of carry away from

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:50.360
 the very relative truth. It's the really truth. This is a current teaching. The whole universe and

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:56.020
 everything is like that. There's no substantial solid entity at all.

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:07.200
 That is absolute truth. So now we kind of, we went all that, now we go to this result. The absolute

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:15.340
 result here, says hey, here, says it, that kind of thinking of I'm going to achieve the result.

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:22.020
 That is dhoma, that is illusion, that is grasping.

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:32.670
 There's nothing to gain on the absolute level. The enlightenment, the Buddha nature is already here

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:40.490
. Brilliant nature is here. Enlightenment is here. There's nothing really to gain, nor there's

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:45.020
 nothing to lose. It's all here.

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:53.020
 And therefore, kind of thinking I like to get this, I like to want this. All this is, conception.

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:59.020
 And for that reason here, says if you are seeing, bounding our true nature, nature.

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:08.950
 And it's a tenement, non-native, both are the desire, both are mind, duality mind, expectations,

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:17.150
 wanting something, not that. This is all duality mind. Of course, wanting, getting enlightenment,

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:22.020
 that is generally duality level, is good mind, is the useful mind.

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:32.420
 But if we look into the point of view of the absolute truth, it is duality, it is attachment, it is

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.020
 clinging.

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:42.310
 Even the slight of clinging in the teaching said, fruit must be free there. In the Buddha teaching

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:53.770
 what said, even slight desire to the Buddha, or desire to reach enlightenment is still stains of

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:57.020
 the obscurations, stain, have to be removed.

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:05.150
 And here said, continue, you will never realize the waking by the fruit of desires. Isn't creating

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:10.980
 more and more and more? We innovate, drag it down in the joking point of view, absolute point of

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:13.020
 view, we drag it down our resolve.

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:18.900
 Blurring the resolve, thinking to get the resolve, achievement, something, kind of like that, we

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:22.020
 can be robbed by dualities, or old by dualities.

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:31.020
 But what it is said, when you reach to the fundamental ego, that is big of the fruit of wishes.

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:33.020
 That is big of it.

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:39.420
 That means you reach to the realization, you reach the part of realization of the nature of the

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:47.950
 mind, free from hope and fears, and discover that with full of confidence, full of realization,

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:50.020
 understanding daily that.

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:56.900
 That is the result. And that's fine. Then, of course, we reach to the brotherhood, or discover

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:58.020
 fully enlightenment.

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:06.020
 So this is the absolute truth, or in the absolute levels of the fruit of wishes, what that is.

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:14.470
 But however, we won't reach to that status immediately, this status. This is our goal, this is our

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:15.020
 teaching.

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:21.020
 But at the beginning of time, conduct, how we should play conduct.

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:27.020
 Always, I said yesterday too, but conduct always should be with mindfulness.

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:34.260
 And in the teachings, not just the minutes, teaching says, conduct should be followed according to

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.020
 Vinaya teachings.

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:46.240
 Conduct follows according to Vinaya teachings as the foundation schools, practitioners of the

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:49.020
 Buddhism, or practitioners of the foundation schools of the community of Buddhism.

00:08:49.020 --> 00:09:01.300
 Follow that and award it to extremes, extremes of the heart case, extremes of the luxuries, lux

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:02.020
uries.

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:12.610
 Relax and stay simple, calm, and peaceful, and continue to practice, meditate, and apply all the

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:14.020
 instructions.

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:20.020
 On the relative level of practices, such as all those hundra practices, akumalaki practices,

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:28.700
 such as akumalai, meri, six-paramedha practices, particularly those five-paramedha practices, and

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:29.020
 then that is akumalaki practice.

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:34.020
 Once in the practice, Dokir is sub-bismissed Western practice, or Western accumulation practice.

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:39.020
 There is always a too many, akumalaki meri, Muslim meri.

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:46.020
 So, accumulation meri is from the university practice all the way to the concentration parliament.

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:51.020
 Why concentration is as accumulation practice?

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:57.020
 Because this time, concentration, we have some purpose in upholding something.

00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:00.020
 That still is mind duality.

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:07.020
 Therefore, it is included as to the part of the accumulation meri.

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:15.020
 And sometimes, also, meri is what concentration is, or pick-paramedha is part of the Muslim meri,

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:15.020
 too.

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:18.020
 But that's not a big contradiction.

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:19.020
 Anyway, that's it.

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:24.020
 And then, Muslim accumulation meri is zuqin.

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:33.960
 So, that we should practice with devotion, with joy, and with courage, and commitment, with

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.020
 determination.

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:43.020
 Keep that practice with mindfulness, alertness, and the sign of realization.

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:46.020
 Now, in practice, what is the sign of realization?

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:51.020
 So, the sign of realization is ultimate sign is what is mentioned here,

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:56.650
 that "prefer" all the hops and figs, and reach the equanimity of the ultimate state of the Buddha

00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:57.020
 nature,

00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:59.020
 all this dakanga that is covered.

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:07.020
 But at the beginning sign, wherever process should pass, what is the sign of this?

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:13.480
 In the teaching also, you said, science of the, there could be many things, we can think, maybe

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:16.020
 dreams, visions, all kinds of all that.

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:21.020
 Those are not, according to teaching, those are not solid.

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:26.020
 Dreams and visions can trick us, trick us.

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:31.020
 And they can trick us, it can blur out, we can activate it, or more dualities.

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:32.020
 Dualities.

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:37.020
 But solid sign of the practice, you know, so when you're practicing, what is it?

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:44.020
 Devotions, pay, F-A-I-T-F, pay.

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:48.020
 And the comparisons, and the versions.

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:55.020
 And even in the teaching highlighted that, see, these poor qualities of the, the result of the,

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:59.020
 are the practices, or the key practices of practice.

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:04.020
 That is, increase more devotions.

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:08.020
 And then, yeah.

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:14.020
 And second is, understanding more meaning of the polynomial cycle process.

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:19.020
 With the preciousness of these lives, and precious lives of others.

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:22.020
 And, impermanent.

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:26.020
 Please see, truly, these impermanent situations.

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:28.020
 See that, please, more.

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:33.020
 Not just wake, and intellectual brain states, or occasion.

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:36.020
 Observing that, really saying that.

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:39.020
 And then, cause and efforts are inevitable.

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:44.020
 Our activities, the practitioner's activities have become so powerful.

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:51.020
 And the teacher says, doesn't matter, even the smallest virtuous activity should perform.

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:54.020
 Don't think, oh, is it not a big deal?

00:12:54.020 --> 00:13:00.020
 No, virtuous activity, very curious activity, and it is good.

00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:06.020
 And then, same thing, smallest negative activities, that looks negative.

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:15.020
 Small should not avoid, or should avoid, don't ignore that.

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:19.020
 And then, samsara has challenge, difficulties.

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:25.020
 Those four announcements, when you have little more understanding of that nature,

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:30.020
 that this is sign of your practice in going quite strongly.

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:34.020
 Then, more completions.

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:36.020
 More kindness, or more more each other.

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:40.020
 Really, kind of, truly is arising from heart.

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:44.020
 Heart, completions, longing, kindness, talk.

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:46.020
 All beings.

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:52.210
 And that more time, the wisdom, the relaxation, the emptiness, the relaxation of looking is very

00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:53.020
 booming.

00:13:53.020 --> 00:14:03.020
 That is a certain sign, that is certain, and this is what's called the unmistakable sign.

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:05.020
 Those are the unmistakable signs.

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:08.020
 With that, those are all happening.

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:15.020
 Our mind, individual mind, also become more gentle, more peaceful, more calm,

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:20.020
 more soothing, really so calming, more kind of satisfactory.

00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:24.020
 For that reason, the greatest teacher Buddha said in the teaching,

00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:27.020
 "Change your mind.

00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:29.020
 Change your mind.

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:31.020
 This is my teaching."

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:36.020
 Now, truly, that teaching is observant to our heart.

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:44.020
 Jockey teachings, or from the Vedic teachings of Buddhism, all Mahayana teachings of Vedic,

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:49.020
 Bodhisattva Jana teachings, or the Sutra teachings, or Jockey teachings, that's the teaching.

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:51.020
 It works the same direction.

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:53.020
 It works the same direction.

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:55.020
 It's really working.

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:57.020
 That is what this is my teaching.

00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:59.020
 That is.

00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:05.020
 Then, when that happens, we are, you are the holders of the Jockey Buddha teaching.

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:08.020
 That is called the holder of the Buddha teaching.

00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:13.020
 Our money is to become more gentle, peaceful, calm.

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:16.020
 Emotions are little bit, can't really become soft.

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:18.020
 And that is how to begin.

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:23.020
 Then it goes stronger and stronger and deeper and deeper.

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:25.020
 Deeper.

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:28.020
 That somehow is not happening.

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:32.020
 Every time for the practice of Jockey teaching and Jockey practice,

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:35.020
 all the practices are not happening.

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:40.020
 That means our practices are going little bit different directions.

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:42.020
 Different directions.

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:44.020
 And I've been practicing.

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:47.020
 Gee, I've practiced this many years.

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:48.020
 What's the "D" something?

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:50.020
 How do you feel that?

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:53.020
 This is not something that happens externally.

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:56.020
 Maybe we don't have to do something.

00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:58.020
 We need to activate those.

00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:01.020
 Because then our practice goes.

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:05.020
 The measurement of the real achievement of it not varied by externally,

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:08.020
 or somebody will say this and that thing.

00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:12.020
 The measurement of the achievement or the realization of fulfillment

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:16.020
 is tested by one's own self.

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:23.020
 Our mind is not behind of our own mind.

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:25.020
 Not to me.

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:33.020
 No. Each of us will know our own mind better than any of us.

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:40.020
 Therefore, we should take through witness of our self,

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:43.020
 see how it's developed.

00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:47.020
 More practice, more meditation, and at the same time,

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:51.020
 calm and peaceful, complete and love and soothing.

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:55.020
 In the teachings, when you have really realizations,

00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:59.020
 the great Master Ati, he said in his teachings,

00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:03.020
 when you have the realization of the practice, the real realization,

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:07.020
 that individual becomes so gentle, so kind, so complete.

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:10.020
 And really it begins to find the complete.

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:13.020
 When you have the absolute realization of true nature,

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:17.020
 or the true realization, the true realization,

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:22.020
 that moment, that compassion is bursting.

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:24.020
 Compassion is bursting.

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:28.020
 Compassion in the wisdom goes targeted.

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:32.020
 Not compassion is going one direction and the wisdom is going one direction.

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:37.020
 A very true realization brings both the compassion,

00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:41.020
 the realization of the compassion in the wisdom.

00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:51.020
 Because nature, what is nature? It's union of compassion in the wisdom.

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:56.020
 All compassion in the wisdom and love and kindness.

00:17:56.020 --> 00:18:01.020
 Therefore, it just comes naturally, for those reasons,

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:08.020
 all those great Masters in their songs, religious, their life stories,

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:13.020
 how they cry and confess and don't to the ground.

00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:21.020
 And so up and so good, those are the signs of "They are progressing.

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:23.020
 They are moving forward."

00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:28.020
 So that's it. And you continue that, and then we get enlightenment.

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:31.020
 Then we get really completely removed.

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:41.020
 We remove the old obscuration, discovery of the Buddha and nature.
