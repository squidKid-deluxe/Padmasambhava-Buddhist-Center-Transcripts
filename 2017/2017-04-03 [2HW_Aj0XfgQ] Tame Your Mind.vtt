00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.610
 Let that go. That means tame your mind. Let that go. It's enough, it's enough. We have to think.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.200
 That's what Pupos says. And I will say enough.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:17.920
 We've been doing that echo, the gracious teacher from the biggest times. Until now, what we gain?

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:25.900
 Echo. Still we are hope and fears. Still we are longing for some good things. Not yet. And worry,

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.520
 doubt, hesitation and fears.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:36.320
 That is continually raging one after another. All that. That is a result of what we've been doing

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.000
 with our mental status.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.660
 So now we have to change. We should let that go. We let that go. What is arising? The hidden

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.440
 quality of the nature of the mind.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:58.830
 The true nature of the mind. Love, joy, appreciation, openness, calm, peaceful, confidence. All

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.520
 those arising.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:06.790
 With that arising, what is in the Buddha's teaching in this case? That is known as taming the mind.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.200
 That is taming.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:16.410
 We're not wild. We're not a disturbance to anyone. We're not becoming as like polka-pies. Not polka

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.360
-pies. Not shooting.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:26.470
 We live each day. We become so calm, so peaceful and happy, nice and everybody says how beautiful,

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:27.560
 how nice it is.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:36.760
 That is the symbol of taming. For those reasons, what is in the Buddha's teaching said. Sign of the

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:44.400
 study, sign of who are already kind of knowledgeable with all the Buddha's teaching.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:52.440
 They are so gentle. Sign of knowledge of Buddha's teaching. So gentle and so peaceful, so kind of

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.400
 common sense or sensible and with full common sense.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:02.460
 That's what the Buddha's teaching said. If you really know, I know the Buddha's teaching, I know

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.400
 this, I know Hinayana, I know Mahayana, I know Vaidhyana, I know Vaidhyana, I know Vaidhyana, I

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.730
 know Vaidhyana, I know Vaidhyana, I know Vaidhyana, I know Vaidhyana, I know Vaidhyana, I know Vaid

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:08.060
hyana, I know Vaidhyana, I know Vaidhyana, I know Vaidhyana, I know Vaidhyana, I know Vaidhyana, I

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.390
 know Vaidhyana, I know Vaidhyana, I know Vaidhyana, I know Vaidhyana, I know Vaidhyana, I know Vaid

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.500
hyana, I know Vaidhyana, I know Vaidhyana, I know Vaidhyana, I know Vaidhyana. We have so many lists

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.400
 actually. Many of us.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:20.810
 But what does this really symbol mean? What the teaching says? Calm, peaceful, gentle, body is so

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:29.780
 calm, peaceful, nice, speech is calm and peaceful, mind is calm and peaceful, that is really the

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:36.400
 sign of the teaching absorbed in the heart, not on the record, on the books or in the brain.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:45.110
 That is the sign, sign of that. And then in the teaching, if you are really a sign of the

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:53.680
 meditation, of the teaching, meditation, less emotions, less emotions, that means negative emotions

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:02.410
 as we all know, name, ignorance, attachment, anger, jealous, arrogance, those are known as negative

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:03.400
 emotions.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:10.610
 Less those, or even there is, even is coming out handled so nicely, it didn't disturbance to one's

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:17.660
 own self, it didn't disturb to the others, instantly liberate you taking care of that, you take

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.400
 that and let it go.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:27.400
 That is known as solid symbol of the sign of the meditations, sign of the symbol of the practices.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.800
 So those are, and then if that happens, what is it called, tame your mind, or when you tame the

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:39.400
 mind, then you really, or then we are really absorbed in the Buddha teaching.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:45.860
 That is my teaching, is it? Teaching is of course, we call this teaching, it's true, these books

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:51.400
 are teaching, but really teaching is in your heart, or in our heart, in our mind.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:59.800
 Have you ever to keep, are we ever to keep that? Then we are the holder of the teaching, holder of

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.400
 the teaching.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:07.440
 Holder of the teaching is not just one selected group, one person, or something, can't be like

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.400
 figure, the teacher, I'm sure they hold teacher too, teachers hold too.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:20.360
 But we all, we all the Sangha members are known as holder of the teachers, teachings, that's what

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.400
 it means.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:27.690
 When you keep that, when you have that realization, we are holding, we are maintaining, we are

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.400
 keeping the teaching.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.890
 Teaching is not something that we are making favor to the Buddha, or kind of trying to please the

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:37.400
 Buddha, but teaching is our nature.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:44.850
 We connect to our own nature, our own true qualities, we are activating, we glorify, and we have

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:50.640
 some degree, help to the other, or that effort to the other, other, and that is like win, win

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.400
 situation, or kind of, oh, we are waiting.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:05:01.190
 Then we really, that is practitioner, that is jochen practitioner, that is Murubhema, some of the

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.400
 followers.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:08.190
 That is follower of the great master, His Holiness Duryamurji, and that is follower of the great

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.400
 master, Kati Vardisharaj too.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.400
 And then all the other great master, that's what we do.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:19.940
 So those are really, just kind of thought, you know, talk a little bit about as, part of this, kind

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.400
 of, again, we always need to each other.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:29.550
 We are actually Sangha members, we are like going in one boat, together and practicing in the

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.400
 teaching of the Buddha.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.680
 Dharma, according to our best capabilities, and Sangha members, one of the very qualities and

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:42.290
 importance of Sangha members, is always in the city, helping to each other, reminding to each other

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:47.400
, inspiring to each other, learn from each other, and move forward.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:52.400
 So in those contexts, in those levels, yes, I say those three words.
