Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche\nPSL One Month Dzogchen Retreat on Chetsun Nyingtik\nPadma Samye Ling Retreat Center\nApril 12 - May 10, 2025\n\nFinal Teaching\nMay 10, 2025\n\nThe first Dzogchen masters left this world in a characteristic way: in a rainbow body of light after giving a final teaching to their disciples. In Tibet, the ones who spread the Nyingtik (heart essence) teaching of Clear Light were the great masters who possessed their special direct transmission, chiefly the great scholar Vimalamitra and Guru Padmasambhava. Vimalamitra passed these instructions to Chetsun Senge Wangchuk, who also attained the rainbow body. The teachings he left were later revealed by the First Khyentse, and are part of the secret category of Dzogchen pith instructions, Mengagde.\n\nThese rare and extraordinarily profound teachings precisely explain various essential methods for directly actualizing the innermost teachings of Ati Dzogpa Chenpo, the Great Perfection, the Peak Vehicle, which is the direct method for swiftly realizing the ultimate nature of the mind and attaining buddhahood in the rainbow light body.\n\nLearn more about this retreat:\nwww.padmasambhava.org/event-details-registration/restricted-silent-one-month-dzogchen-retreat-at-psl-w-ven-khenpo-tsewang-rinpoche-april-12-may-10-2025\n\nLearn more about the Chetsun Nyingtik:\nwww.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Chets%C3%BCn_Nyingtik\n\nwww.padmasambhava.org",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.050
 In principle, as we all know, Ven. Khenpon Paulenche, Rinpoche, Ven. Khenpon Tsewang Dongyal Rinpo

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:12.000
che, we owe everything that's good and worthy and true and wonderful to you both. Thank you so much.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.280
 And we also, on behalf of the Sangha, I'm going to kind of take a leap here. We really request you

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.840
 to keep teaching this Chetsun Nyingti in this upcoming one month, and into the future, really.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.000
 Please keep teaching this to us. We really, please.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.600
 I know what I really like to do. I think since we are doing a one-month retreat, it's really so

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.800
 special practice. All Dzogchen teaching is so special, but this is particularly first grade since

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:48.000
 he mentioned it, specifically, clearly, in the teaching that you got the book that translated.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.040
 And at the end of that, he really said that everybody can practice. I want everybody connected,

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:03.000
 whoever is interested. Also, it really will benefit you all. He mentioned that so strongly.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.120
 I thought maybe this Dzogchen teaching is really the Togah teaching, the Tutu teaching, Togah

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:15.840
 teaching, everything. So then, since we're practicing all of that, I thought maybe we'll go with

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.000
 his blessings, the Veroja, the Malamata.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:29.600
 And then, all those grade marks, the Gurba and Masambha come together as one single state as this

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.000
 teaching. So, we observe this teaching.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.780
 And that didn't mean that you're not going to practice with others. All those different practices

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:42.610
 you're engaging. Practice, keep those practices, but keep this practice also a part of everyday

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.000
 your practices.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.970
 And then, maybe one of those other practices are completed, then maybe a more focused on this, this

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.800
. And then, I think it's really wonderful. Then, of course, among the meditation, the Tutu

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.000
 meditation is the foundation of the practices.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:08.450
 And then, the Togah is the result or advancing practice of the Tutu. And the teachings say that

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:15.280
 without the Tutu practice, the Togah won't follow all that. So therefore, Tutu is so important, and

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.000
 that I think we all know a little bit more now.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.930
 And so, I'd like to ask to keep that practice. And I think I mentioned that before, and you already

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:31.110
 know, but every practice is combined with the three nobles, the beginning noble, the middle noble,

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:37.350
 and the concluding noble, and the beginning noble with the beautiful intention, with those old

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.000
 motivations.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:45.650
 And really, bodhijeta had you in appreciation and devotion, those. And then, those are the

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.260
 beginning of motivation. And then, middle is the practice of whatever you're doing, but

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:56.000
 particularly for the Togah meditation, then focus more on the Tutu practices.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.910
 Then, every practice, the Togah also do the Togah practice, but also in the teachings, the Kondi Re

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.000
hi practices are also really important.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:15.280
 So even though it's considered as the beginning of the Dzokhi meditation, but the Togah, I'm sorry,

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:25.460
 the Kondi Rehi is really very powerful and very effective to bring the Kukli realization, and also

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.000
 to play with the duality.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 Of course, follow the instruction exactly when we do the Rehi practices, those.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:44.230
 For example, in the teaching, he said every year, he said many months, Kondi Rehi practices on was

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.000
her-pig mornings.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:53.990
 And really, many masters say that every year. I mean, that master also doing the Kondi Rehi

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:55.000
 practices.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:02.280
 The Kondi Rehi practices, that is that, for example, this teaching one is very much connected to

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.000
 the also Togah meditation each time.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:17.130
 The times are old, and those practicing middle novels and Kondi Rehi novels, as the dedication and

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:22.000
 aspirations, those are really important.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:29.320
 So I just really thought to remind him to all of us. I'll just say that once again. Same thing, but

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.000
 that's what the teaching says.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 Okay, thank you.
