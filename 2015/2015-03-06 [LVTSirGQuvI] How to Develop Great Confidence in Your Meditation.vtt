00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.640
 As I divide it over the day, divide as following the masters of the lineage and dividing in the

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.000
 three sections.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.550
 Beginning excellent, middle excellent, and concluding excellent. Among those three now in the

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:17.000
 middle.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:28.500
 Middle also I divided into three sections, which is the foundation and the path and the result, the

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.000
 fruit.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 Fruit and three sections. Three divisions. So the ground, we can't do like, went over that.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 Briefly and we went through that. And ground, again, once again, ground is not external ground.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 Ground is our inner nature, the fundamental, the essential nature, the ground of everything.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 Everything and that is rupa. Simple word, rupa, and every use, knowledge, terminology, salt-borne,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 awareness, wisdom.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 Ram yom ke yishi, that rupa. And that ground is ground of everything.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.140
 Whether we can kind of believe it or not, it's so surprising, shocking. That is ground of

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.000
 everything.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.210
 And immediately looking, that is ground of our body, ground of our speech, and the ground of our

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.000
 mind.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:41.090
 All that. And that is ground of all our forms. Forms in the universe, all form systems in the

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.000
 universe,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:51.660
 in all the space of the universe, all started from this, this. Therefore, and always in the tantra

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:52.000
 of the teaching,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 named ground, it is ground. And sometimes, also this name, another synonym, I make it other,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 riff with those synonyms, but another synonym is tantra. It's called tantra too.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 Tantra is called foundation tantra, ground tantra. Tantra is Sanskrit word,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 which means, means roughly in the English, is the kind of continuation. It's continuation.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.280
 So this is the ground of continuation. The primordial wisdom of the rupa is the ground of

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.000
 continuation

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 of display of everything what we see, everything what we experience, everything what we go through.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 So that is what is ground. So again, that's it. So we went through that breathing of this.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 This, as like beat instruction, beat instruction, and went through that and pointed out,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 I call it lineage teachings. So that's it. And now, today, we move to the next division.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 Next division is, as I said, that first is ground, then the path, then the fruit or the result.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 So among that three, today, now we follow, go all with path. Path. The path is divided into three.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.710
 And that is, I think, I also, I make it early, and I'm sure you heard, and you know that before too

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:21.000
 young.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 It's not just during this time we heard. Path has three, the will, meditation, and conduct.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 Those are the divisions of the path. Path, will is path, meditation is path, conduct is path.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:57.040
 And all that cooperatively took it. Without our living, our exposals, or without change, we have to

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.000
 carry all that.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 Three, three. And therefore, in the teaching of what you say, or those great Zoki Masters teaching,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:14.370
 you say, the pit instructions of the will, pit instructions of the meditation, pit instructions of

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.000
 the conduct.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 Three, this is, goes side by side, all inseparable. It goes out, there.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.410
 Now, will, again, I mentioned the other day, and you heard, we heard this from our great teacher, K

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:32.000
.T. Padhe,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.350
 here almost many times, but will, will is what we're going to meditate, what we're going to follow

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:39.000
 the path.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 Will is so important, that is, we're going to keep up that. Will, we are going to keep the will,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:56.930
 vastness according to the open, vast sky. That's what we're going to keep that. Will is so

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.000
 important.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:06.550
 And for that reason, what the great, I mean, always I say, will is, something that, will is that

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.000
 something we developed,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 through the understanding, precisely the meaning, meaning that without any doubt.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 So that means, confidence on the will. Confidence on the will is so important.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:31.760
 You understood, you're going to, then going to, will that. You're going to, will, will. Behold like

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:32.000
 that.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.210
 Or you're going to will that. When you're willing that, what is the name, the other name? It's

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:38.000
 meditation.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 When you're willing without that, will. That is meditation, meditation.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:54.580
 So therefore, will is so crucial and is so important, that will make the difference of our practice

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.000
. Will is important.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:03.780
 Therefore, that means doubt. If we have the doubt and hesitations of the will, then our ground is

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.000
 shaking.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 Our meditations are shaking. Our conduct will be shaking. Conduct will be shaking.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 And therefore, will is so important, it's like, it's knowledge. It's knowledge, understanding.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 And that's what great master Mahabharati said. Will is something that whatever you're thinking,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 see that exactly clearly as it is without any doubt, doubt or hesitation that have to do.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
 That is so, that is the what doing is.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 And this time, will is, what's it called? The pre from everything, everything.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:55.680
 Pre from every grasping, every clinging, even the naughty of the free, that naughty even freed,

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:56.000
 freed.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 That is what is our view of the zoki, zoki movements.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 This is not just on the zoki teachings, but every Buddha's teaching has this, this.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
 I mean that we know, we started, we started.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 For example, let's see, as we go to the Hinayanas, Hinayana has two, two groups.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:26.760
 As again, we learned, at least two groups. Those are known as the Sharakayana and the Pathik Bodhay

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:27.000
anas.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 Always simple, we tell, just say Hinayanas.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:38.080
 These two groups, two individual or two groups of the practitioners, the Sharakayana and the Pathik

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.000
 Bodhayanas.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 And the Sharakayana is then Araka, I mean, no not Araka, sorry, I shouldn't use that.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:53.150
 Sharaka, Sharaka means, means actually literally translated Sanskrit word into, into Tibet,

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:55.000
 translated as Tudho.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 Tudho means, heard, when you, you heard and you speak out.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:12.550
 What that means in a city, Sharaka, Sharaka, in Sanskrit word, is as a listening, listening and

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:13.000
 speaking.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 Listen as you heard, you heard and speak out.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:23.200
 What that means in the teaching said, because those great Arathas, this Sharaka, so devoted to the

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.000
 Buddha.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.550
 This says, write the Buddha, write in front of the Buddha or when the Buddha is giving the teaching

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:33.000
 and listen carefully, is listening the teaching from the Buddha.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 Carefully, what they are understanding with their compassion, also sharing that with others,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 exactly Buddha's word.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:47.240
 Not articulating anything about their, not interpreted by any of their conceptions, adding any

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.000
 things.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:57.000
 Tudho means, listening carefully and pronouncing that to the others, exactly that.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 And that school, school is then named also as the Hinayanas.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 Hinayanas say, what is the will of the Hinayanas, for example, the Sharaka yanas, the will.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 Egolessness, that is the will.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:20.000
 Egolessness, no egos, no egos, that means no I.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:27.000
 Clinging the I is the fundamental problems, fundamental problems to all the schools.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000
 It started from here, all the way to the Doki teachings.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
 This is problem, problematics.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 Clinging is, and particularly, clinging to the individuals.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 For that reason, great Master, of course, Nagarjana too, but great Master Shanti Deva said,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 in the K.J. Rambojan, many great Master take whatever.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 He said, in the world, and all in the world,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
 all the suffering, the difficulties, whatever you go through or see,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:10.000
 this, this all fundamentally generated by the ego, or I.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 And all the fears, of hope and fears, all that is generated by the ego.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 Clinging is, clinging is, sense is, therefore, why I am going to keep this ego?

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
 Why I am going to keep this all?

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 This is the problem, this is making every problem.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 The problem of why I am going to keep this.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 Sense is that, sense is that problematics, problematics, are really, truly existing.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 Then, of course, maybe we should have the reason to keep this.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 But it is not existing, truly.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
 And that truly not existing, it is just nausea.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 No, there is nothing here.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
 That is why you read the books, Bodhisattva Charyavataras, all other books,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:05.000
 from the top of the body or head, all the way to, to, finding out where is ego,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:11.000
 where is I, where is this, and there is no existing ego.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 I, at all, anywhere, outside, inside, between, up and down, and everywhere you look.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 When that is then fact, there is no ego, no I, I.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 And when you find that fact without any doubt and hesitation,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
 and then relax on that, meditate on that.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:40.000
 We did it again, with the conjure, beautiful conjure, and then meditate on that.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000
 That is known as the wheel of the Hinayana or the Shravakayana.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000
 And then, by the way, Bodhayana, they have another, a digital realization,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:56.000
 of the, all these subjects are, sorry, objects are in, in us, beside the ego clings.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 That is their wheels.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
 Actually, I am in the Buddha teaching, when you read the philosophy,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 or not just the Buddha teaching, but practically, we have two clings.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 We have clings to the south, we have clings to all the objects.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
 This is our two clings. This is true.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
 I mean, this, everybody does. Two clings.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 But this is just clings. Clings, there is nothing really existing,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 entities that is permanent, that can, can truth.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 Everything is hallucination.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 We are grasping to the dream, we are grasping to the mirage,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 we are grasping to the hallucinations.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
 Hallucinations. And we are grasping to the magics.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 Magics, it surely is not.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 When you are grasping to the magics, when you are grasping to the hallucinations,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
 it is not wise.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 And kind of following that, trying to do this and that, it is not wise, it is not smart.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000
 Nobody will say in samsara world, people who cling to the mirage,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 who will cling to the mag, hallucinations.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
 Anybody know, won't say, oh, that person is expert.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.000
 Oh, he is a famous scholar, she is a scholar. Oh, that is something. Wow!

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
 Nobody really will say. I mean, think of that truly.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000
 This is the MSG, we are practicing, we are going to find out the fact,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
 what Buddha said and use our intelligence and mingle that

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000
 and find out exactly entities, truth from this.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 This, this is our responsibility.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
 Our greatest teacher, Buddha said that, exam, think carefully

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 and follow that goal, my words, follow.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 And we analyzed MSG, all it is, is not true.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 And that is now and then, the part of the Buddha, he rejections.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
 All the subjects are empty.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 Sorry sir, I am using a different word.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 Objects are empty.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:56.000
 So, the whole ego-cling is empty and as well as all object entities.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 Objectus, entities. What are objects? Have I said roughly to that?

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 I mean, you know, objects are, there is five objects.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 Five objects, object I is home, object A is sound, object of nose is smell,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:19.000
 object of tongue is taste, object of body is touch.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 Those are called objects.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 Here, they realize that it is empty or as hallucination,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 as mirage, as magic, as a dream, they realize it.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 That is empty and black with ego-clinging, ego-lessness.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 Realization and through that, again applying that,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 keeping up that mood with the beautiful convert and beautiful assistant

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000
 and then they got a rata word, such as, "part of Buddha's Jams."

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 And that foundation, this is now starting.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
 All the nature is going deeper and deeper.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 The Buddha taking it deeper and deeper and deeper, deeper.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
 And now went to the Mahayana schools.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 Mahayana schools are within mind-only schools

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 and as well as Madhema schools. There are two schools.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000
 Mind-only schools, see, everything is hallucination as a dream.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:21.000
 Relatively, you see everything as dream, dream, mirage, as hallucinations.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 Reality now is free. It is empty.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 And see, every subject and object, all is empty.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
 And with beautiful conduct of the body, each other,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000
 with beautiful conduct of the understanding and applying that,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
 and they reach them, Buddhahood.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 Realization of those mind-only schools.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 This school, always those great master says that this school,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 always one have that they hold, is that fundamental mind.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:55.000
 The mind that is free from the duality is that mind existing.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 That thought, therefore, they come as the thought schools.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
 They came, so they're holding something still.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
 Even though everything is just totally fine,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
 and the same as the Mademaka or as Jokhin, everything,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000
 but there's still something keeping up there, some entities.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 And that which is known as the subtle mind.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:26.000
 That which is free from the dualities, free from the clinging to the subject,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
 free from the clinging to the object.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 That freedom of that entity of the mind, the subtle mind, is there.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
 That's what this thing is.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 So they're keeping something, therefore, again, kept as like this thought,

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.000
 in the thought schools.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.000
 And then from now on, all the Jokhin teaching, everything is free.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
 Mahayana, such as Mademaka, everything is free.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 There's nothing existing that entirely universe in samsara and nirvana.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
 One smiles the entities, entities.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.000
 That is not totally freedom, total freedom.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.000
 That, and which is also known as free from all the complex cities,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
 free from every aspect of the complex cities.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 And beyond that, inconceivable state, everything.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 Then went up and up again and deeper, and always again.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000
 So with that, and then both each other, and get realization.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 Both each other, conjured with both each other,

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 and then they got the realization, such as Buddhahood.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
 According to this school, as we heard many times,

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000
 then those great masters or great, like Bodhisattva can reach enlightenment,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
 highly intelligent Bodhisattva can reach enlightenment

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000
 within three complex eons, seven complex eons,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
 thirty-two complex eons, so forth.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
 But then it's just one part.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
 One way, continuing moving forward, advancing,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000
 going forward, reaching enlightenment, but the whole status.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 And then go to the very end, and continue one above another.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.000
 And then in the three, in that other's levels, and then Mahayoga.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000
 See, everything is for great purity status.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
 Mahayoga teaching, what is it?

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000
 Everything is related level, everything is in divine mandalas.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000
 Mandala of the body, mandala of the speech,

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
 mandala of the mind, what's the mind?

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 Everything. And the absolute level, that all, again,

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
 in a great emptiness, in total, economic status.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 There's no difference between absolute level, that divine and that emptiness.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000
 Same, same central status.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000
 They just, and then in the Ano-Yoga teaching, what are the teachings?

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 Again, in the old way, they said that everything is,

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 what's the state of the Buddha Samad-Bhadras,

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
 the female Buddha Samad-Bhadras status.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 It's total, the three mandala state, again,

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.000
 three mandala, and old in nature, is total open freedom,

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000
 as like, as a mandala of the Samad-Bhadras.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000
 From that, natural, unceasing, variety display,

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000
 emanation, coming as a skillful means of all the Buddha Samad-Bhadras,

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000
 and they are completely united, inseparable united,

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:22.000
 and displaying all the unceasing, call it, call it of the,

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000
 the children of the bodhicata,

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000
 the children of the great bless from the states.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000
 That is, all, everything in the three mandala states, all that.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000
 And then, reaching enlightenment within these dark times,

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000
 all, all in the path of state, and so forth.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.000
 And now, we link up to the upper, the highest state of the teaching,

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 which is then, Zokhi.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000
 Zokhi, we've already discussed the other day,

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.000
 and I also repeated three times, again.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000
 The everything is, no matter whatever the explanation,

00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:00.000
 whatever that is, all is the primordial wisdom of the Rupa.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 Rupa, sub-luminosity, clarity, luminosity state,

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
 is the peak of the, like, as a pyramid.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000
 In a way, pyramid, way of the park,

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000
 we reach to the peak of the now level.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000
 Everything is kind of descended from that,

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000
 and everything is merged back to the concluded,

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.000
 back to the peak of the pyramid of our awareness.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 Our awareness of the primordial wisdom

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000
 is the source and the display of everything.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000
 And this nature is then in the trikaya status.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000
 Everything emanated from this,

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000
 everything is concluding to that status, to that status.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000
 Its heart is totally free, free and empty, open, clarity,

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000
 and full of the energetic status.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000
 That is the Zokhi rule.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000
 And that meditating of this, then, will continue to move,

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000
 move, and reaching enlightenment.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000
 As it is within this single item, not just even that.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000
 And in the four example tips in single theory,

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000
 that we had great opportunity to resist the teaching of this,

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000
 great masters and the mumahinte, known as sometimes.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.000
 And this master reached enlightenment within twelve years.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000
 And then he came by himself.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000
 Of course, he called it his story,

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000
 or the life story, meditated so many years,

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000
 over twenty or thirty years in practice, and all that.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000
 But it's not just that, that time,

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000
 after thirty years he got the realization of something.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000
 But the moment he really started meditating,

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 he dedicated himself so many ways of realization.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000
 Science comes one after another.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 This is what they then called advancing and developing,

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.000
 and propelling the every steps with joy and appreciation.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
 So this is generally our will.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000
 Our will of the will.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000
 Will is so important.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000
 Will is important is that, therefore, we should try to bring.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000
 And now, what are we going to do then?
