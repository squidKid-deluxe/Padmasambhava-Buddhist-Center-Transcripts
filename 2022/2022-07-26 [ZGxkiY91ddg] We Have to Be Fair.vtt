00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.800
 The practice in this language, due to effort, quality, commitment, determination, loyalty

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:12.760
 to the teaching, loyalty to the practices, and then we really need to resolve, resolve

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:19.400
 enlightenment with these languages. Definitely. Tangible resolve. Every teaching said, every

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:25.400
 master said. Why are we not getting this? Because we are not doing enough practices,

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:32.400
 or enough those qualities. That we are just still distracted by all the activities of

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:40.400
 samsaras. So many activities that we do. Endless chores that we have to do. Of course, we have

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:46.600
 to do. We have to do those. Those all come important to the front. Front. Everything

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.000
 is in front of the line. Dharma practices is kind of almost a sight behind. And just

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.600
 we try to grab because of time. And we grab. Otherwise it's so important. So bad. I'm

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:07.600
 important. I'm important. Why? Hey, you forget me or something like that. That's why. Then

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.200
 we're just always running to the samsara. And then even though we try once in a while

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.600
 or grab or once in a day, in a short time, in a morning time, or sometimes during the

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:26.600
 day, it won't make too much. For about 24 hours, we are wondering in the world of duality

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:35.600
 for maybe 23 hours. So how much really we can progress? This duality is not just according

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.600
 to what I teach. It's not just accumulated on this lifetime. We're carrying the whole

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:48.600
 package of fast lives. Even a lifetime. Really just so many things. That's so many. Really

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.600
 carried that. And now we're trying to play with that. But once in a while, for one hour

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.600
 or half an hour, trying to play with that, of course it really will happen. Definitely

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.600
 it's so strange, so good to do that. But that won't make big difference. So therefore we

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:14.600
 couldn't become cranky or I'm not getting any result. So I've been practicing these

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:22.600
 for 20 years or 40 years. It just looks like so. But in 20 years or 40 years, in 40 years,

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.600
 for example, when you say 40 years, did we really practice it for one year? Have we really

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:37.600
 solved it one year? How long did it become? I don't know. Maybe one month. But still,

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.600
 teaching of the greatest teacher, the Buddha chapter, so powerful. Really powerful. Powerful

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:49.600
 spiritual and resilient teaching and connecting, making connection, we are really making the

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.600
 difference to our nature. It's so spiritual. So beautiful. It's not something that we lost

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:01.600
 with it, but of course we can expect big things immediately. It's not something that teaching

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:09.600
 is not powerful or my practice is not powerful. It is powerful. It is. It really helps with

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:17.600
 that. But however, it just won't make big things. So we have to be more sensible and

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:28.600
 realistic. Realistic and we have to be paid. We have to be paid. It's a pay-pee-pay-pee

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:41.600
 something. So that's it. So this is a spontaneous inheritance. And this is a spontaneous

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:47.600
 inheritance.
