00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.880
 "I'd like to bless the teachings that we went through this month. I'd like to do some prayer and

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:16.920
 then bless with the text and I have all those teachings what we went through is here and as well as

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:24.000
 more others, so I'd like to put this and talk with the teachings of the Munto practices, those who

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 are all I will bless. I will bless."

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:36.080
 So we all come up and then you are. And then bless, I have, Nori has prepared that to show you is

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:43.000
 not something too exciting things, but yet it is quite important.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:52.550
 My father, he used to do a lot of pause stations and early his life, I mean not early life, in the

00:00:52.550 --> 00:01:01.450
 mid sixties he'd been doing every day one thousand pause stations, long pause stations, every day,

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:02.000
 really.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.640
 And kind of, after a while, he was doing so many pause stations, and he got something here bumpy,

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.000
 bumpy in a hard high sport. Usually you can get that.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.310
 The pause people who do pause stations from all the way to Lhasa, that your rumba stages really get

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:25.000
 that. I mean, it's just sometimes, because it's touching all the time on the floor, all the ground.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 So he got that. But then, in the day living, we got there, and the doctors told that he couldn't do

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 that many pause stations.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.750
 So he reduced the 500 pause stations. That would be every day, every, I mean, he used to do it in

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.000
 the night time, get up two o'clock in the morning, and he is doing pause stations.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.980
 And in India, not like this, luckily so many, not all India, but many, more than people, had just

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:56.000
 shared the rooms, one room or two rooms that really shared by many.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:04.620
 So I also sleep with him in the same room, and in the midnight, he got up and did the pause station

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:10.000
, about 500 pause stations, every night time he does.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.220
 So, and then afterward, again, it's the doctors told, shouldn't do that many, all that. So he

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.000
 reduced, I think, 200 something, maybe 50 or around that one.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 So that he'd been doing all the time. And so this is what?

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 Captain.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.840
 That's what we've been doing in the cabin that we rented in the deal in nearby day, and the floor

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.000
 is like, tick.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 What's the tick word?

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 Tick wood.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 Tick wood.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 Tick wood.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.160
 It's very hard because that's what this name is called in the address of what they use, Purgany C

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.000
ottage.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 Purgany Cottage?

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 Purgany Cottage.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.100
 I heard in British time, those, those offices built that, and they used it, maybe in summertime or

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.000
 whatever.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 So they led some residents to that area, bought that house, so this owned by them.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 But the structures are all those really beautiful and tick wood flowers.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 So this is the tick wood flower, and that he made all stations, all the time.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 He's a foot friend. He did all those great master's foot print on solid stones.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 But here, he made the foot print by his effort.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 That's difficult. So this is what really?

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 This is the toes.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 This is the toes. I think, this is the, I believe, left leg toe.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 That's a big toe.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 Big toe, and this is the small toes toe, and this is the ankle, and this is the right leg.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 Like big toe, and this is that, and that ankle.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 So this is the ankle.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 He did this.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 This, this, this is very positive.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 And the back leg is small.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 So this, that's it.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 And so then when we moved, or when he decided to come, this country,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 and then children would get asked to the landlord, everything came,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 because all the floor is now, I can't really spoil it for them.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 So it was okay to change that.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 We would replace the new floor, and then take this.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 They said, yes, that's okay.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 So that's where we go.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 Good.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 And so that, that also you can see a close up,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 and I will put this text with my prayers.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 To you, up and then we dedicate the money.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 Okay.
