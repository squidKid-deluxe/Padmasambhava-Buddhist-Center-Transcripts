00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 "Given the circumstances of our lives now, in this type of lifetime, so busy, so many

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 constraints, most people are not able to spend 7, 9, 12 years studying at the feet of their

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 teachers and practicing all the teachings. If one is unable to receive any of the teachings

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 and practice them well, but if one does kangrimens over him well, and if one has done a lot of

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 ahti-yoga practice, should one feel content that one can accomplish one's practice in

00:00:35.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 his lifetime?"

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 For example, generally Dzogchen is the highest teaching, converse teaching, embodiment of

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 teaching, and we practice this really can reach enlightenment and make a difference. Dzogchen

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 teaching alone, we don't need it for that reason. For example, as I said, Garabdol is

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 three-word. First word is tatyektok yihin tepeh. This translation is kind of not always easy,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 that bring that flavor to Dzogchen. At least I cannot do always that, but decisive, one

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 point is decisive in one way or the other. What that means? It means that natural level

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 is, I mean that's the nature, but also the natural level, we don't have to in the teaching

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 say, we don't have to be more water in the mouth. What's called mouthwatering. We don't

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 have to mouthwater into the other instruction, this and that thing. It's destructive. If you

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 really have the courage and the commandment to develop, this Dzogchen is the highest teaching,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 there's nothing higher and deeper, more profound, more well-teaching than this. Dzogchen, and

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 that is the witness by all these great masters. For example, lumchimba, rich enlightenment,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 rich enlightenment by Dzogchen meditation, and gimme lumbar-rich enlightenment, Dzogchen

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 in Dzogchen practices. Garabdol-rich enlightenment by Dzogchen practice. Of course, why they

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 become as a lineage master? Because they practice one's mutual making, courage and the commandment

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 not lingering in this and that. Really they pointed out, they rich enlightenment. One point

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 Garabdol-rich is kind of slightly different, but medhishiri, medhishiri said, once upon

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 the tawariha, the level, they are ordinary person like many of them. They asked, just

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 said, but their courage and commandment, detriment, mention and stable and confidence practice,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 put that into action. Then they become such great masters, great biological beings.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 When you read this, there are so many of these, of course. Anu, you are teaching this and that.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 Of course, it's good to practice those. Dzogchen is the most powerful ultimate, and therefore

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 what the great master Kepong Nachong, that I think many of you read this book, Life Story

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 of Medhishiri, he looked and he said in his teaching, said that ultimately there is nothing

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 higher and bigger Buddha than the Buddha Samyant Bhattara. That Buddha taught Dzogchen teaching.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 Dzogchen teaching. And there is nothing higher and deeper than Dzogchen teaching. There is

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 nothing to say. Even Buddha came right now in here, to us. He has nothing more to say

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 than Dzogchen teaching. That's what this great master says. It's true. That's really

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 what it is. All these great masters, many of these, they really reach enlightenment, because

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 of Dzogchen realization, combined with the Ma'an and Azi. Therefore, this is the highest

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 teaching, and it's really excellent. That's what teaching says.
