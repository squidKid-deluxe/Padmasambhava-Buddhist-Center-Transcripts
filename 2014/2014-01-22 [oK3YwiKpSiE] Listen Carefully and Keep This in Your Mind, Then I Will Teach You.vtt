NOTE     "synopsis": "On January 18, 2014 in West Palm Beach, Ven. Khenpo Tsewang Rinpoche began the first day of teachings during the 2014 Dzogchen Winter Retreat. In this video, Khenpo Rinpoche explains how always in the teachings the Buddha said:\n\n\"Listen carefully.\nKeep this in your mind.\nThen I will teach you.\"\n\n\"What does that actually mean? This means listen with a beautiful motivation that is not disturbed by any negative emotions like anger, arrogance, doubt, hesitation, or skeptical, intellectual thoughts. Then you're not listening perfectly and carefully because it's mixed with emotions. Or sometimes we listen with judgemental thoughts, thinking \" How is this person going to speak?\" If we do this, the teaching will never be absorbed.\n\nWhat will happen instead? Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche always used to say that teaching will come in one ear and immediately go out the other, like going on a highway, maybe not even stopping at the toll booth! Then what will happen? Maybe we will even get a ticket!\n\nWhen we do this, the teaching isn't held in the mind. Even if you hold it for a short time, it quickly goes away like a pot with a hole in it. When you pour something inside it, even though it goes inside, it leaks out. That's why the Buddha said, \"Oh noble son, Listen carefully and keep this in the mind, then I will teach you.\"\n\nwww.padmasambhava.org\n\nPalm Beach Dharma Center\n1205 North Federal Highway\nLake Worth, FL   33460\n\n(561) 547-4711\ninfo@pbdc.net",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.530
 So many teachings about the suttas over 30 volumes. For example, this is one of the volumes, or

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:12.000
 this is the one called the "Buddha Suttas", the "Buddha View" teachings.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.380
 In the teachings said here, for example, if I read this from here, in the teachings said, "Buddha

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.000
 that time, when you have this teaching, begins, begins."

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:34.150
 In the teachings said that, "Buddha that year, Buddha was residing in the shavastha, in the dead of

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.000
 the groves."

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 "He did rainy season retreat, three month rainy season retreat."

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.680
 "Racy is finished." So that means, now it came to the autumn. Some of you see it, and now it came

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.000
 to autumn.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:02.220
 In that autumn time, Buddha told to all the audience, all those who are there, he is going to be

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.000
 challenged.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.540
 If anybody like to come, or like to join with me, they can come. If they like to stay, they can

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:11.000
 stay.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 So Buddha announces that. And when Buddha announces that, then what has position of the Buddha,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 Buddha has position.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:35.240
 Buddha has ropes, Buddha has bagging balls. That's the position. That's not he has. So here he said

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:45.980
, in the teachings Suttas said, "Buddha kept those ropes, and he wear the ropes, he called the bag

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.000
ging balls, then he is on the move."

00:01:49.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 He is on the move. He is on the move with so many monks, and others, and many great bodhisattvas.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 They all came. So many came. They all went from shavastha to Vaishali, and quite two of you went.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:23.840
 And he is quite far, far. But that was his route. In the teachings Suttas said, "Buddha went to sh

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.000
avastha."

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:33.030
 Vaishali is one of the very special places. The Buddha slept many times. So I think he went from sh

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:41.000
avastha to Vaishali, and even in the car, he takes a few drives.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.530
 From shavastha, continually, I think it takes definitely 12 hours by car. So it's a long way, I

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.000
 think, in a way.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.790
 But anyway, Buddha, usually when you go, I mean usually, Buddha is bare feet. Bare feet, he walks

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.000
 with them.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 So when he arrived in Vaishali, and then he stayed there, stayed again with all the sangha members,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 they stayed and meditated, meditated and practiced.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:23.370
 Everyone is so calm and so peaceful, and so relaxed, so soothing. Everything is. And beautiful

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.000
 cities, everyone is just calm and peaceful.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.170
 Audience, and Buddha, and everyone. At that time, among all the audience, there is one bodhisattva,

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:52.000
 known as Chodva Gavajyabha, the Supreme Delighted Bodhisattva.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:01.070
 He was there. And among the group, without any shy, without any hesitation, with deep respect and

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.000
 appreciation, he raised.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.600
 He said, "Great blessed one, what are all the different stages of the practice, meditation, what

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.000
 are the samadhis and so forth?"

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:20.120
 He asked one up and another, those criticals. And Buddha asked one up and another. And then he

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.000
 asked, "What are all the, how to reach to the Buddha?"

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 "What are the instrumentals to become a Buddha, to benefit all beings?"

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 Buddha mentioned all the parabuddha practices. One up and another is parabuddha practice.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 There are parabuddha practices as you, many of you know. This many is the six parabuddhas.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.930
 The six parabuddhas, the other is the parabuddha, or the transcendental, the other is the transcend

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.000
ental practices,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:59.900
 morality, transcendental practices, passion, transcendental practices, and as well as the joyful

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.000
 effort, transcendental practices.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 And concentration, transcendental practices, and wisdom, transcendental practices.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:22.080
 And Asian, the skillful means, transcendental practices, and powerful, transcendental practices or

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.000
 courage in commitment, transcendental practices.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.780
 Inspiration of transcendental practices, true, willing, the wisdom of transcendental practices, and

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.000
 Asian of those.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:40.320
 When you apply those transcendental practices with bodhijata, that means practice, transcendental

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:47.000
 practices, completely mundane, with true love, through compassion.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.900
 True love and communication activities that are reflected through this six parabuddhas without

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:59.000
 attachment, without clinging, without any grasping.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 Then it becomes transcendental. Then it becomes transcendental. It becomes so clear, so believed.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:15.620
 There are no strains of the ego, no strains that are attracted, that pull back, that become unclean

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:16.000
.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 Clean. It's pristine. We don't have the ego cleanly. We're not attracted with it, grasping.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 All this is called the transcendental practice. Clean transcendental practice.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:34.240
 When you practice continually applying that, that individually, in the teachings, individually, is

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.000
 the brilliant.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:42.740
 As the sun is shining in the sky, that individually is the beacon of the samsara, beacon of the

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:45.000
 darknesses that the individual is.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 That individually is truly as guidance, actions of the beings, all the beings.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 That individually is a true friend of every living being.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 When you continue to pursue that, that individually is totally peace, individual.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:15.460
 That is not just the beacon of the old being. That individual, in the world, that individual is

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:16.000
 trying to experience something totally different.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 No. Totally joke, totally peace, totally happiness.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 Happiness is just so beautiful. As it's beautiful outside, it's beautiful in.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 As it's beautiful in, it's beautiful outside. It's so believed.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 We continue to maintain and continue to get that way.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 Then what the result? Result is known as the Buddha and invite.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 And there is this is what the Buddha Shakyamala said, all those.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:57.510
 Then this great master of this very bodhisattva, Chodh Gavrya, that delighted bodhisattva, supreme

00:07:57.510 --> 00:08:00.000
ly delighted bodhisattva or supremely delighted one, said.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 And how many Buddhas came there is.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
 And Buddha said, there is so many Buddhas came ancient times.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:12.230
 This is not just the Buddha, it's a sadhana, a prayer, because whoever ignited their inner nature,

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:15.000
 inner their beautiful thing, called it is.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 Buddhas are coming because Buddha is not just coming. Somebody is producing.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.800
 Buddha is individualist. Whoever walked with his six paramattas or transcendent of the six paramatt

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.000
as or the ten paramattas,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 they truly wrote to the enlightenment, they truly bring the total happiness to him.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 So then so many great Buddhas came in the past.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 Then Buddha mentioned a few of those things.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 And then said, how many Buddhas are going to come in the future?

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:53.240
 Then Buddha said, then Buddha Shakyamala said, there is then one thousand Buddhas will come in the

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.000
 future.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 Among that, then four Buddhas came already.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 And this great master said, then what this great Buddha said.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 Could you tell me first, the names of those great Buddhas will go and come.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 All great is bodhisattva who are willing to become the beacon of the world,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
 who are coming one after.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 Could you give at least the names of this?

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.650
 And then Buddha give one after those, after the names of the one thousand Buddhas, one after

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:25.000
 another in this text.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 They say, all Buddha is one thousand Buddhas, Shakyamala said.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 And after these Buddhas listed all the names, then this great bodhisattva asked again.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 Since you already great Buddha, you already mentioned that.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 How wonderful.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 You see, this is that they will have benefit to the gods, the means, and all the beings.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 It will make happiness, it will make peace, peace to everyone.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:00.230
 And so, they will have these names of this great bodhisattva who are going to come or become the

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:01.000
 Buddhas.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 How wonderful, how excellent it is.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:10.000
 Now, could you tell me, could all these Buddhas who are going to come, this great bodhisattva,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 where they will be born?

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 What is their client's name?

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 What is the color they have?

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
 What is the parent's name?

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 What is their lifespan?

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 How long they are teaching the bodhisattva?

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 Could you tell me that?

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 And then Buddha said, yes, I will tell you, great bodhisattva, I will.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000
 You listen carefully, as you listen carefully, hold that teaching.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 teaching, always the Buddha teaches it, in the Tibetan.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000
 Lapar, yuna, yilasongdhe, ngeetu, in Tibetan this is.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
 Lapar nyuma, listen carefully.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 Lapar nyuma.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 Yilasong means keep that in the mind.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
 Mind.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
 Mind, then I will tell you.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
 This is the teaching said, always.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 What that means to each other.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
 That means, listen carefully.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 That means, listen with the beautiful moderation, beautiful thought.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 You are not listening with any emotions.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 Not such as anger, arrogance, doubt and hesitations,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
 sculptural thoughts, angle at the thought.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 Then you are not listening perfectly.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:33.000
 Not listening carefully, listening because emotion is mixed.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 Or sometimes listening how that person is going to speak.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 Kind of like a most judgmental, listen.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
 You do that, or we do this, whoever do that.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
 That teaching is not absolute teaching.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
 What that happens, that teaching comes from this.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:59.000
 That teaching comes from this and it goes from here.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000
 It's just a transition.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 It's an idea.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
 I think why?

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 Maybe he's not really even starting a toolbox.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 He just went through.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 We will get what for?

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 To get two. Not that kind of letter.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
 So that is known as not listening.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000
 When you do this, then what is teaching then?

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 It's not holding in the mind.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 It's going away.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 Even if you hold your mind, then teaching is important.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
 That is the example of what in the Buddha teaching.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
 That's just really teaching.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
 It's like a ball that has ball.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
 You pull things inside.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 Even though it went inside, it leaked.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 It went out immediately.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 At that level, you're not holding it.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 Here go here, the Buddha said, "Reggae ball, noble son.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000
 Listen perfectly and hold that in the mind."

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 I was telling that.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 Then Buddha gave all those as he asked, one after another.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 So this is.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 After he finished this, after that Buddha finished that,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000
 then he asked again, this Buddha said, "How did they develop that?"

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000
 I mean, Buddha, you mentioned that when they become all this Buddha holding enlightenment,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 this is the only choice to become them by the body jata.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 How did they develop the body jata?

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 This great body jata.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
 How did they develop the body jata?

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 And with whom?

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 What they did?

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 How did they become the body jata?

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
 How did they develop the body jata?

00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 End of Buddha then mention again at the end.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:27.000
 Then Buddha said, "How did they become the body jata?"

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:34.000
 And he went with the Buddha, one after another Buddha mentioned.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
 So that is what this one thousand Buddha said.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 This is the Buddha's teaching.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 There is over a hundred and now we got this book.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 It was published by the very renowned Nima teacher who lives in the west coast now.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:04.000
 And so many beautiful books, really beautiful books.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 And so many beautiful Dharma activities that spread out all over the world.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 One of the earliest videos of the daily teaching that he did.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 So he published these books and he collected entire Buddha teachings

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
 that what is translated into tripping.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000
 Even some Buddha teachings are not unable to do the wood block.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 They didn't do the wood block.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 So they didn't do kind of the sculpted there.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
 But he put all together.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 It is over a hundred and fifty volumes that I got.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 So this is very blessed.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 And so this is the text that is.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:47.000
 And according to his numbers, it is 56th the Buddha teaching.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000
 56th, but it is the beginning of the Suttar teachings.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 Put all the different one of the Guru teachings.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
 So this is 56th begins.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:06.000
 That is the breathing of all the one thousand Buddhas.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.640
 one told him to put us.
