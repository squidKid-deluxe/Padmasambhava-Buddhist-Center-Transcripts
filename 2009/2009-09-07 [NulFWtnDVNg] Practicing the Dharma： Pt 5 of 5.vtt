 "This is again the nature, the nature of the relatives, as whatever the cause is, the result will

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:14.190
 follow similar, and that is, that we also are, we begin to see ourselves to you, that anger breaks

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.920
 the anger, I just praise the kindness, and everyone that helps us."

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:49.700
 "And the same way, externally, the poison, see, migraine, the poison, result, then the positive,

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.840
 also the same way, as we mentioned, the idea of the poison is a lot like it."

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:56.920
 "Light, from light to light, light to the light, bright and bright, and then it goes shining in the

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:03.840
 glory, again it continues, so that is how the positive and the negative mind is out of that."

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:25.840
 "And then blood bond, as Mother pointed out, is known as neutral mind."

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:33.840
 "And neutral mind is very neutral, neutral in a way, it has not in a big effort."

00:01:33.840 --> 00:02:02.840
 "Either side is not the positive, nor it is negative, and therefore it is named as neutral bond."

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:09.840
 "But neutral is, in one way, in the kind of foundation mind, very balanced, very just neutral."

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.530
 "It can be turned either side, you don't let it inside, ready to turn either side, positive and

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.840
 negative, so that is known as negative."

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:26.400
 "It is simple, kind of like a flat, negative, sorry, neutral bond, neutral bond is just like, most

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:33.170
 of the other, looking into the sky, looking into the leaves, looking into the different things, or

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.840
 simply just walking."
