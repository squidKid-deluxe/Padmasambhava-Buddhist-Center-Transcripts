 [VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:46.790
 -I was so surprised that she did that, and we know her nature, and she writing is so rare such like

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:47.360
 that.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:54.240
 She is so special as she was stuck up in her head, her aspiration, her intention.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:01:00.240
 And I think that has been something so-- it is special, so special.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.600
 And therefore, all of the Samyas, the disciples, the students of the Kijinur-Mukhi,

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.520
 the stone, the devotion, trying to keep the practice in view of Samyas,

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.520
 preserve the Samyas' connections, and the practice will get it.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:23.520
 And then, I think it's a little bit of sunshine to see him bring a connection.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.520
 But that come, that is always the teaching said.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:34.800
 When the disciples or the individuals, when it's ready, the enlightenment, manifestation,

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.520
 will appear according to the readiness of the individuals.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.880
 He used examples in the Buddha teaching as the work is so clear, clear.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:52.440
 It is immediately trying the reflections of the sun and moon without any delay that will come

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.280
 naturally.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.680
 Similarly, Samyas' practicing is with Kriya's practice, and where it has started.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.280
 And then definitely a beautiful opportunity will come, and that will come,

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.880
 and we will pray for that very much.
