NOTE     "synopsis": "December 23, 2023\nPadma Samye Ling\n\n\u201cThe twelve links (Skt. nida\u0304na) of dependent origination, which were taught in the Abhidharma discourses of the first turning of the wheel of Dharma, demonstrate the process through which all phenomena arise interdependently based upon causes and conditions. These links are traditionally ordered as follows: (1) ignorance, (2) karmic formations or habitual tendencies, (3) dualistic consciousness, (4) name and form, (5) the six sense organs (i.e., fields) of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and intellect, (6) contact, (7) feeling or physical sensation (8) craving or thirst, (9) grasping, (10) becoming or being, (11) (re)birth, and (12) old age and death.\n\nThe entire process is driven by ignorance, defined by the maha\u0304pan\u0323d\u0323ita Mipham Jamyang Namgyal Gyatso as \u201cnot knowing the Four Noble Truths and assuming that the ongoing movement of the five aggregates is an enduring \u2018self.\u2019\u201d\n\nVenerable Khenpo Rinpoches\nCeaseless Echoes of the Great Silence\nGlossary (pg 201)\n\nAs an offering to interested Sangha members, Ven. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche has requested that Saturday Ngondro sessions with Lama Laia and Lama Dragpa be webcast.\n\nFor those who wish to join, instructions will be given on the essential points of the Dudjom Tersar Ngondro foundational practices, their vital importance within Tibetan Buddhism, as well as instructions for each section, including Refuge, Bodhichitta, Mandala, Vajrasattva practice, and Guru Yoga.\n\nThe essential meaning of this practice is that the Tibetan Buddhist foundational practices of Ngondro embody all the teachings of the Buddha. They are a perfect and complete framework for cultivating a balanced, effective, and rewarding spiritual practice.We\u2019ll also get to practice the entire Ngondro every session!\n\nLearn More:\n\nIn \"Illuminating the Path,\" Venerable Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche and Venerable Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche give clear and profound explanations on how to practice the path of Ngondro \u2013 the foundational set of practices of Tibetan Buddhism. This book includes line-by-line commentary on the concise Dudjom Tersar Ngondro revealed by His Holiness Dudjom Rinpoche, detailed instructions on how to practice, and helpful visual illustrations. It is both deep and accessible pointing out how we can see our fundamentally enlightened nature.\n\n---\n\nLama Laia Pema Tsultrim was ordained in 2003 as a monk by his teachers Ven. Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche and Ven. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche at the sacred site of the Buddha\u2019s first teaching in Deer Park, India.  He is a resident Dharma teacher at Padma Samye Ling Monastery in New York, where he has lived since 1999. Lama Laia is a senior editor of Dharma Samudra Publishing, leads daily meditations at PSL, and regularly helps with the Padmasambhava Buddhist Center (PBC) monastery and nunnery in India. Lama Laia\u2019s unique style of communicating the essential pillars of Buddhist tenets enable him to impart tranquility and joy, while encouraging great enthusiasm and inspiration in others to develop mindfulness, compassion, and wisdom.\n\nwww.padmasambhava.org",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.120
 So, welcome, welcome. Again, just rejoicing that once again, we're all here, and as usual,

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:25.640
 just to really set with our three noble, vital motivations of the entirety of our practice

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:36.640
 and our path, we'll just take a few moments to again reconnect with our joy, our appreciation,

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:46.280
 vastness, Bodhichitta, with the wish, sincere, based on the Four Boundless, that all of our

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:53.040
 activities in this next hour, in this day, in this life, in the boundless lives can only

00:00:53.040 --> 00:01:00.920
 be of benefit for infinite beings. And then also with that great confidence and purity

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:09.720
 view of devotion to the basic essential goodness and perfection of this place and time, teaching

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:37.160
 everything, keep that three vajra awareness to the best of our abilities.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:46.560
 So even with these basic motivations, I'm kind of continuing a little bit from last week

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.800
 where we're kind of reflecting on karma, and especially within the context of these four

00:01:52.800 --> 00:02:02.880
 thoughts that turn the mind. We've reflected, of course, on the preciousness of this human

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:11.680
 birth, impermanence, the defects of samsara. And then last week we were kind of reviewing

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:18.640
 a little bit, touching on karma, and kind of went into the 12 links. So we're going

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:30.080
 to review that a little bit again. And just to karma, the natural law of cause and effect,

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:37.240
 that's so all-pervading, so beautiful, this profound lion's roar of the Buddha's teachings.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:46.360
 And even with these basic motivations we have, we can just see how karma, meaning, it affects

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:54.960
 this moment, our motivation. But even in reflecting on this precious opportunity we have right

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:04.680
 now to even hear the dharma, not to mention contemplate it, and awaken it in our own experience

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:13.080
 and heart, and undo our samsara, and bring out our goodness qualities for the benefit

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:23.320
 of all beings. That too, like our great teacher says, it's in no way co-accidental. It's not

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:33.360
 random, that's equally just a part of our good karma. And as well as the power of this

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:42.040
 aspiration of bodhicitta, when we're really sincerely connecting with our bodhicitta motivation,

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:50.920
 and that's the base for all of our activities. That's so powerful, that's uprooting samsara

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:59.840
 from its base. Like I mentioned last week in this sasum linkpa refuge, "O Mahum," I take

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:08.520
 refuge in the three jewels in order to shake up samsara, I generate bodhicitta. That is

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:17.200
 also using this current fortunate circumstances to just increase its power and use all that

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:26.080
 is ripening for us, this moment to expand and purify into a more and more natural authentic

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:33.480
 state which means it also will be of benefit for others. And then of course our purity

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:43.780
 motivation, our devotion, so profound that deeper trust in the basic nature which needs

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:50.480
 to be based on experience, and yet all the experiences we have again are the results

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:58.880
 of our past actions and the motivations and mindsets that we were experiencing in that

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:06.560
 moment, and that we choose now to either not engage with or to engage with to bring our

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:13.760
 future. And then along with this great vastness bodhicitta, that devotion especially to the

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:22.600
 pure realization of our precious teacher, of the guru yoga and mingling our mind with

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:35.920
 the pure direct perception of the guru, so profound in that pure view and that pure realization.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:47.240
 So anyway, just that, reflecting on that for myself. I don't know if people had a chance

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:54.440
 to check your emails yet but I mentioned last week I went over these 12 links of interdependent

00:05:54.440 --> 00:06:05.200
 origination, co-origination, but I was able to send that a little bit ago so if you have

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:11.920
 that you could look in your email and I thought maybe we'll just kind of review this again

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:23.720
 having a little visual. And if you were with us last week hopefully you can kind of recall

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:28.760
 a little bit of that and it was benefited, if not I think this is recorded so there's

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:36.520
 a lot maybe I don't need to go over since we have the magic of the recording but we

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:45.560
 want to be able to remember these things for ourselves, right? So we'll just jump right

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:51.240
 in, we'll just review these links to kind of have a framework to then continue our discussion

00:06:51.240 --> 00:07:02.960
 a little bit and of course lama drop if you have anything to note or add please it's fine.

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.520
 So if you have this, if you don't, I'm going to say these 12 links in case you don't, if

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:14.200
 you do you have it here. So this is from this really wonderful book by Reginald Ray that

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:21.640
 he prepared I think for some of his classes at Nalanda called the Indestructible Truth

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:28.640
 which is introducing you know the three turnings and the three vehicles of Tibetan Buddhism

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:33.960
 and kind of giving a really good foundation of these foundational teachings and views

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:40.760
 and practices and in that in his discussion of the three turnings in the first turning

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:49.000
 teaching he goes over among other things these 12 nidanas or the 12 links of interdependent

00:07:49.000 --> 00:08:01.880
 co-origination meaning again our way the Buddha gave us to look at our present experience.

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:14.960
 And again remembering the four noble truths samsara suffering it has causes ignorance anger

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:22.680
 attachment ego clinging ignorance and negative emotions are the causes of samsara and then

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:33.200
 of course there's cessation of suffering and the path of undoing revealing the beautiful

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:43.440
 peace of nirvana or cessation. So these 12 links are you know what's called again the

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:49.840
 wheel of life often like you can see in Padmasamyaling if you've been here in the entry hallway

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:55.680
 shows the wheel of life which is very traditional in all the the Buddhist monasteries at the

00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:03.400
 center it shows the three animals a pig a rooster a snake that are all kind of attached

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:11.800
 to each other and those are representing really the fundamental cause of suffering of samsara

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:19.080
 of all the six realms experiences of beings is the basic ignorance and then aggression

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:27.180
 and and you know aversion and and attachment and craving all the actions that stem out

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:33.160
 from those three poisons to the five poisons and unfolding actions based on them causing

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:43.040
 some sara right cause plus conditions has results and the results of our present experience

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:53.840
 are based on our past actions our past past states of mind the conditions that were arriving

00:09:53.840 --> 00:10:00.760
 then how we engage with them creating a future moment that then becomes a present moment

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:08.360
 and that keeps perpetuating itself and these often what we experience happens it's like

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:22.400
 a blur it's totally it is a magic trick an amazing web of illusion right of interdependence

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:30.400
 which functions perfectly and yet all based on emptiness the great emptiness without the

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:38.120
 great openness and emptiness of inherent existence none of this perfection of relative you know

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:47.240
 causation cause and effect could function so the buddhist pointing out again these twelve

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:53.980
 links are in a way of for our our minds to begin to look at what all seems like it might

00:10:53.980 --> 00:11:02.280
 be a moment unexamined or where we're totally caught up in our circumstances including our

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:07.480
 outlook and our way of responding totally caught up in our emotions this is a way of

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:13.320
 starting to break them down and look at just the mechanics of it and then of course with

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:23.720
 practice seeing how to begin to stop it so these twelve links will say them again the

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:31.960
 beginning here it has this wheel the first and it has both the Sanskrit terms and the

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:39.000
 English terms so for simplicity now I'm just going to really refer to that English terms

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:51.720
 so the second one in here ignorance the next going clockwise karmic formations the next

00:11:51.720 --> 00:12:05.920
 third consciousness for name and form five six senses six contact seven feeling eight

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:18.680
 craving nine grasping ten becoming eleven birth twelve decay death so this is kind of

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:25.920
 like the wheel that's spinning what's making this whole wheel the energy that makes helps

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:32.720
 this whole wheel spin is our ignorance this is it you know definitely can chip all that

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:37.520
 appreciate pointed out in kimpo say won't kind of use that metaphor it's like a fan

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:43.360
 ignorance is like the electricity making the fan turn the more we can cut down our ignorance

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:50.680
 our fundamental not knowing of like the four noble truths of not knowing the true nature

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:59.600
 of our own mind the more we can increase that familiarity and perception the more these links

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:04.680
 will pass down which includes having at least beginning to have an intellectual understanding

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:15.720
 of this map so we have causes and results so another way that this is broken down is

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:23.160
 there's cause and effect right every cause when the conditions come together for the

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:30.400
 cause or the seed when that's in the right conditions brings a result and then that results

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:39.880
 can then based on within those conditions of that result our actions within that context

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:50.020
 create causes for future results and on and on and on so sometimes again this is referred

00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:57.880
 to can be looked at as lifetime to lifetime but I think right lifetime to lifetime is

00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:07.040
 totally based on every moment that we have so this is also understanding every instantaneous

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:20.080
 moment of our our experience and if you look here in in the very center of this wheel has

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:28.240
 past present future so these first two ignorance and karmic four nations are in a way for this

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:38.840
 present moment our past this present moment is where both we're experiencing the effects

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:46.200
 of our past actions and habitual tendencies and patterns we're experiencing their ripening

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:54.880
 and then we're engaging with them and that all in the present moment so that's consciousness

00:14:54.880 --> 00:15:07.040
 through becoming and then based on those everything that's arising in our circumstances in this

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:16.160
 moment inner outer and how we engage that is making seeds for a future experience unlike

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:23.160
 we've heard in the past even in nature right when the right when a seed is born when a

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:31.000
 seed is planted it's going to create even more you know fruits than the one seed will

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:37.640
 bring many many fruits and inside that many many more seeds which will just be perpetuated

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:46.840
 if the conditions are continued all right so going back here ignorance in a way is the

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:56.760
 ground for all of our the based on ignorance is happening because we've remained ignorant

00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:04.080
 of our and to some degree you know right again the only difference between a fully enlightened

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:12.160
 Buddha and sentient being is the degree to which we recognize the nature or not so there's

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:19.680
 degrees of ignorance of course it's not a black and white thing and that's important

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:27.240
 I think for us all to remember as we're just little babes on the path right with these

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:36.040
 great role models of those who've fully developed it so there are our ignorance has remained

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:45.880
 within the ground of that ignorance means all of our past habits all of the the actions

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:52.720
 we've taken in the past have now become causes or seeds that are in the conditions of our

00:16:52.720 --> 00:17:03.320
 ignorance and that brings us to then this present moment where we have consciousness

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:10.080
 naturally a big part of that consciousness is our diluted consciousness all those karmic

00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:16.560
 habitual patterns that have been planted in our alaya based in our past actions then begin

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:25.160
 to naturally sprout forth and then extensions of that those habitual patterns are what then

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:35.000
 like in fourth name and form where we begin to have perceptions concepts of in all the

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:42.200
 different ways we can label things and a part of that process then extending from that is

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:49.560
 then the six senses like we went over last week again all of our our five senses our eye

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:58.800
 here nose taste sensation our body conscious our mental consciousness all these six senses

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:06.440
 perceptions both from the consciousness side and the objects of our consciousness and the

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:12.280
 interface we have with them all those are developing to play out again these habitual

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:24.920
 patterns of person in an environment you know beings in their universe etc so our six senses

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:32.920
 that habitual pattern is happening of subject object and then and then contact is how when

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:43.520
 our consciousness is then meeting you know our our consciousness is meeting the sights

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:49.120
 we're seeing the sights we're hearing the sounds smelling the smells tasting the taste

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:57.400
 feeling the sensations having the thoughts and again right that sometimes we might that's

00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:05.640
 a very subtle difference to between those things I mean it's so quick so kind of you know almost

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:12.880
 inseparable in a way looking so contact is when the subject object is meeting right feeling

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:19.120
 then what's our habitual pattern of how we feel about what we're perceiving whether it's

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:28.920
 an outside thing or an inner emotion or thought you know perception is how we're feeling so

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:37.040
 all this is the effect of our habitual patterns and there's nothing much we can do about that

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:43.600
 nothing at all we can do about that as far as controlling what happens to us or what might come

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:51.040
 up for us you know as far as emotions or how we feel about something but often then again we get

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:58.880
 caught in the blur of identifying as our emotions or you know feel trapped by our circumstances or

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:08.720
 we're so wrapped up in either our hopes or our fears that we we lose this next step and really

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:17.520
 important difference between how we feel about something and then craving or thirst is another

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:25.200
 of this eighth link is the difference between how we're feeling about something whether it's

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:30.720
 whether we feel an attraction to it and it's going to help us and nurture us and give us

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:39.120
 comfort and pleasure or if it's something we're totally averse to something scary disruptive

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:49.200
 dangerous unpleasant you know unhealthy danger in some in some way or it can even be neutral

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:56.720
 things of course there's those basic ways so but the difference between how we feel about these

00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:07.200
 things and then that really the tipping point between how we feel about it and then if we decide

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:18.880
 to really continue the thirst cycle to really take the hook in a way to how if we really there's

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:24.720
 like a very subtle thing the buddha said there where there's a difference between how we're

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:34.560
 feeling about things and then if we decide to move into that feeling and begin to in a way

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:41.360
 try to inhabit that feeling identify with that feeling so that's this eighth link of craving

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:49.040
 grasping is again this like almost indistinguishable difference then between when we've decided to

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:57.760
 kind of take our own bait and engage with our habitual pattern and inhabit you know our thirst

00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:05.440
 and then grasping is when we actually make the actions with our mind and our body our speech

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:15.120
 to to actually engage and activate you know inhabit in this again in this present moment

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:23.200
 like all this that we were experiencing good bad neutral becoming is then another part of

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:32.720
 this present moment where the action happens the on whatever level instantaneous to increasing

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:40.560
 so that's all this present moment within that the effect is from consciousness

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:49.360
 all the echoing out through name form the six senses the objects of the senses making contact

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:57.680
 with them how we feel about them is all the effect now the part that's the effect part of

00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:08.080
 our present moment the cause what creates future karma is then this part of how we engage with

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:14.480
 our thirst or our craving which can also here it's not just our craving but it also can be what we

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:14.480
're

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:21.840
 we totally reject so just to understand that here in this term craving or thirst mean can also

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:22.240
 imply

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:30.400
 whatever strong feelings or degree of feeling that we decide to engage with be it aversion or

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:42.480
 attachment or desire you know so then craving and grasping are then and then becoming are

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:50.480
 creating the full cycle of then creating seeds for the future and then we have the future then

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:59.040
 in this sense is what's called on the 12 links birth and then decay and death or early age and

00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:10.560
 death so birth is just again can be the next moment it can also be and then of course because

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:20.160
 things are everything that's interdependent and conditional is subject to impermanence naturally

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:26.800
 it's going to decay it's going to fall apart in some way or another and then that leads us into

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:35.440
 you know what becomes then the present moment whose past is based on our ignorance and etc

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:41.280
 so i hope that's just a little helpful and again there's so many wonderful texts to kind of go

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:48.480
 over these 12 links like i mentioned in this indestructible truth also in temple rumpushes

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:54.720
 in of course because these are such fundamental teachings um in walking in the footsteps of the

00:24:54.720 --> 00:25:01.280
 buddha the path of freedom by kenchen paulden shara brimpashe and kenpo se londong brimpashe

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:08.160
 it's another wonderful text on these fundamental teachings also goes over the 12 links and karma

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:14.880
 of course in the chapter on um in illuminating the path particularly that goes with our nundro

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:23.840
 teachings again they go over in the four thoughts karma in ceaseless echoes of great silence again

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:31.520
 this commentary on the heart sutra the in the heart sutra of course the the buddha and

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:38.640
 it is going through you know all these first turning teachings and bringing in the view

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:45.760
 of great emptiness you know so goes so there is a teaching on the 12 links within ceaseless echoes

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:56.800
 of great silence i mean there's so many um i think also in uh the buddhist path

00:25:56.800 --> 00:26:02.720
 or the opening to our pride mordial nature and the causes and conditions of mind rumpushes

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:10.720
 really go over in a way these 12 links sorry i didn't turn off my buzzer um

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:17.280
 and in that point too they're kind of they're really looking at

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:27.520
 this present moment is based on is our past moments and our past actions

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:33.760
 and when we begin to follow them back and back and back and back right every present

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:46.080
 moment is the result of past actions all those past actions are present moments of the results

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:51.680
 of past actions going back and back and back and but where can we find the beginning since

00:26:51.680 --> 00:27:00.400
 beginningless time so that's why this aspect of looking to the mind the mind you know we have

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:10.160
 these three doors through which we create karma the three doors our body our speech our mind

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:17.760
 of course it's renowned that while it might seem like we're really subject to the sensations and

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:26.080
 things our body feels and the words and you know energy we have but it's really when we look

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:26.560
 closely

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:35.600
 our mind and how we is how we relate to our body and speech and energy and if we go to look for

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:42.640
 mind itself it goes back and back and back and of course no one's found their mind even the buddha

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:48.240
 and of course that process is why it's so important like we mentioned last week

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:56.720
 our basic practice that encompasses all our practice is the accumulation of merit and wisdom

00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:05.200
 that means again positive karma is merit when in our present moment

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:15.280
 which is so favorable while of course we we all have mixed feelings and habits you know

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:21.920
 and ways of perceiving we're still so fortunate this precious human birth with all the favorable

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:29.600
 conditions you know and luxuries which are so the the dharma in our mind and heart

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:37.040
 and the ability to practice so profound so beautiful so precious this is the result of

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:45.760
 our good karma of our merit you know and knowing that can really inspire us to continue

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:55.680
 and become more aware again of what's helpful for building you know positivity for ourselves and

00:28:55.680 --> 00:29:06.000
 others positive karma that means based on you know contentment bodhicitta devotion

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:22.400
 actions for boundless aspirations a good heart you know any actions and you know of our body

00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:31.840
 speech mind with those are going to bring favorable results for our futures and likewise

00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:39.360
 being aware of what's negative what's harmful you know these classical teachings on the the

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:51.360
 ten non-virtues three by body four by speech three by mind you know becoming aware of the

00:29:51.360 --> 00:30:00.160
 destructive qualities of those and that what animates them again is our our aggression our

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:08.160
 aversion our wrong view of reality can skew you know the act all the actions of our body

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:14.000
 and misuse of our speech and misuse of our body and those are going to just create more

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:21.040
 trouble for ourselves and others and the law of karma is it's really only ourselves that it will

00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:27.120
 experience the big results of our karma our experiences and that's inevitable you know like

00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:34.560
 they say like uh you know a body and its shadow i mean there's the you know patram pache talks

00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:41.280
 about you know it's like our the are all the causes we've made in our past good or bad

00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:48.880
 we may not see their results right now but when the conditions come together it's like when you

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:57.040
 know a bird lands suddenly its shadow will appears likewise so we don't need that can also be

00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:57.600
 positive

00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:08.160
 you know so accumulating merit that's what's happening here between feeling and craving

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:15.520
 grasping becoming when we're engaging in accumulating merit is how we're using

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:25.600
 whatever is arisen for ourselves however we feel about it even neutral turning it with bodhicitta

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:32.640
 and pure perception and more contentment and renunciation engaging with it for the positive

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:40.720
 that's like this right the bodhicitta practice of joyful effort joyful effort for virtue you know

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:50.960
 engaging everything you know with joyful effort with sincere effort that's also what you know

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:59.360
 our motivation is what makes our karma more or less powerful how we're feeling about it so

00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:06.400
 that's happening and then there's all these words and all these things we can

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:12.960
 you know listings we can have in this beautiful frame that we can have for the bait for this

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:17.360
 moment but again this is something for each one of us to just look and use this tool to kind of

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:25.920
 break down what might seem like one continuous solid thing see how it breaks up the difference

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:33.840
 between how we feel about what we perceive and how much then we're going to actually

00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:42.560
 inhabit it in a way you know and that's also why calm abiding meditation is so fundamental

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:49.740
 to our insight of the true nature of our bringing out our wisdom if we can learn and train

00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:50.080
 ourselves

00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:56.400
 to relax and be undistracted we have a direct experiential

00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:08.160
 path that again we're creating more of a habitual pattern for just being more aware of the spaces

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:18.480
 between you know the parts of our habitual patterns and then as we purify our negativities

00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:28.160
 and obscurations which again is karmic increase our our meritorious and virtuous activities

00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:36.400
 you know based on you know the three motivations applying these great supports of our mindfulness

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:45.760
 our alertness conscientiousness then we're creating profound we maybe only see that very itsy bitsy

00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:52.880
 little tip of the iceberg of how beneficial this is for our future lives and for the benefit of all

00:33:52.880 --> 00:34:02.400
 beings and just like we begin our practice with these powerful motivations and relax with our

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:09.680
 main practice engage all you know activate all the paramitas based on our four boundless

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:15.600
 do our nundra practice with that devotion reflecting on all the different aspects of our

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:23.840
 nundra session always right then we dedicate another one of the great lions roars of the buddha

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:33.200
 our aspiration you know dedicating the positive effects of our practice and our actions for the

00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:41.440
 benefit of all the limitless beings throughout all time but also the power of aspiration you know

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:49.760
 just like part of the conditions of our present moment is that our wisdom is limited right now

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:53.520
 our capacities are limited right now

00:34:53.520 --> 00:35:00.800
 but the nature of our mind like rempoche say is infinite and unimpeded

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:09.840
 therefore that's why the buddha said it's so important to engage with our aspirations again

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:19.200
 our motivation really in a heartfelt way using you know it's our imagination is the only limit

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:25.440
 to what we can aspire to and not just waiting till the end of our practice for that aspiration

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:31.600
 but in the beginning having those aspirations in the middle having this aspiration and this

00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:38.880
 closeness feeling allowing ourselves to experience the moment and also you know kind of let our

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:47.120
 aspirations draw us towards you know fulfillment but with that we always have to act in accordance

00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:55.440
 with our capacities what our present abilities are you know and being practical and sensible with

00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:55.680
 that

00:35:56.640 --> 00:36:03.600
 so having vast aspiration pure motivation but then being very practical with working with our

00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:10.960
 present moment just like Gurrenpoche said you know my view is as wide as the sky it's very similar

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:17.440
 but my attention to the law of cause and effect is as fine as flower and for these omniscient ones

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:24.320
 again this is the skillful means of the great ones they still work with interdependence but

00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:31.760
 they're not bound by karma you know and due to their great kindness and compassion and the

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:38.880
 total fruition of their bodhicitta they're working with interdependence to meet our independence

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:45.360
 and give us tools these skillful means vast powerful skillful means practices of the vajjhana

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:54.560
 especially here to like purify and develop our bodhicitta so i guess all i'm saying is again

00:36:54.560 --> 00:37:00.720
 another really point i'm reminding myself is connecting with our motivation so important

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:06.400
 no matter what our current abilities are being sensible about what our current abilities are too

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:20.720
 and um maybe i'll finish this too with this one person asked a question kristen that kind of

00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:27.360
 reflects again here to our capacities not only our own capacities but the capacities of others

00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:38.560
 and really being careful about our actions so um she was saying many people today feel traumatized

00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:44.800
 and are expressing that more readily almost as part of their identity

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:55.520
 since identity isn't fixed but constantly moving and evolving how do we work with or talk with

00:37:55.520 --> 00:38:02.080
 people who feel or identify with trauma so strongly that they can't see the potential

00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:05.280
 for evolving past that as identity

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:14.320
 how does vajjhana buddhism frame trauma in a way that honors the experience

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:22.080
 but also encourages a broader evolving perspective also in a way that doesn't

00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:30.720
 insult that individual's experience wow that's a very amazingly good rich question

00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:41.440
 well i think the first thing that comes to my mind is what a little mouse in the grass i am

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:52.000
 but yeah we don't we i think the important thing we have to all remember in again trying to be

00:38:52.000 --> 00:39:00.960
 good practitioners and in actualizing our bodhicitta of really being of benefit for other

00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:11.360
 beings for other human beings in our lives and being of true help it means again along these

00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:21.040
 lines of capacities and aspiration we always have to work within our own capacities

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:29.280
 we can have really good intentions and we as practitioners might have these you know really

00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:37.600
 trust in you know karma and the deeper openness of identity and the emptiness of self so to speak

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:45.120
 but really i don't think i could give a pat answer to this these questions just in the sense of

00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:50.400
 everyone is so different and not only do we have to always act in accordance with our

00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:57.200
 own knowledge and capacities but as bodhisattvas it's very important the teachers are always

00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:05.360
 reminding us we also need to engage with others according to their readiness and their

00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:15.040
 desire to want to to do anything you know so it's a tricky question

00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:21.040
 i think the only way i i would really feel comfortable answering it is saying as far as

00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:33.840
 practitioners we do the practice we we read we contemplate we practice we really take bodhicitta

00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:42.800
 to heart which means not only our activities but our our wisdom is increasing how our emptiness

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:51.440
 awareness can deepen and become more pervasive and you know full of bringing out the richness

00:40:51.440 --> 00:41:01.370
 qualities of our buddha buddha nature's love and compassion and wisdom you know as being

00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:02.000
 responsible

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.640
 for our own experience as practitioners is kind of more where i'm coming from here

00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:13.840
 and then of course as we do that then we can be of more help but how to actually kind of answer

00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:14.080
 this

00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:22.720
 question as far as how to help others i think that's so relative to each one of our own field

00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:29.840
 of knowledge and experience and skill and our familiarity with the person involved and their

00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:37.440
 readiness and their willingness and whatever their experience of life is it's so varied so

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:45.360
 beyond being practitioners that's also each one of us as just human beings there's such a thing we

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:51.990
 have this wonderful supports of you know different people who do are trained to help with trauma

00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:52.240
 who

00:41:52.240 --> 00:42:00.080
 are helped to like unfold and move ourselves out of our rehearsals of distress you know and being

00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:08.480
 caught in loops of distress you know and that's a very you know tender thing and very careful thing

00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:17.840
 so i think we if we can direct people towards like a really something they want to do that's

00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:23.760
 really well equipped to help them just on the relative level even if they're you know buddhist

00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:30.400
 practitioner or not that's that's there and again just in the sense of openness when we

00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:41.200
 can move into a situation that we begin can begin to examine and hold what we're experiencing

00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:52.160
 you know challenges you know traumatic you know ways of you know contracting and being you know

00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:59.120
 reacting to our present situations and like bringing it back to you know however we want

00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:08.080
 to define trauma if we really begin to put ourselves into a safe space to explore with

00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:14.480
 someone who's skillful at helping us navigate that that gives an experiential experience of

00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:22.560
 that things can change and open you know so again little by little by little

00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:29.520
 carefully carefully please carefully all of us i'm not really qualified to

00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:37.440
 give much more advice i think on that plus we're kind of finishing up our time for talking i think

00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:46.480
 is there any other little points with that i had two points for the 12 links yeah they've really

00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:52.480
 helped me over the years um in terra vada like foundational buddhism specifically i'm referencing

00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:59.200
 like going to vipassana um they emphasize there's actually two spots to actually break the cycle of

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:05.280
 the 12 links and be free of suffering and the one that's emphasized in terra vada buddhism

00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:15.520
 is right after feeling link number seven vedna and then the next one is craving tanha so actually

00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:23.040
 they say when a sense object meets a sense door like we see a thing with our eye when that contact

00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:30.320
 happens there's literally a physical feeling sensation that moves through our body and that's

00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:38.400
 actually um the feeling vedna and there's three types of feelings pleasant unpleasant and neutral

00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:46.800
 and based on our habit pattern we tend to want to keep or crave the pleasant ones push away

00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:52.960
 the unpleasant ones and we're basically just unaware of the neutral physical sensations

00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:59.680
 in our body and so that's where we can actually break that link of this cycle into the next

00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:06.800
 so to actually know there's a physical sensation happening as a result of experiencing an object

00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:14.560
 and instead of saying i want it i don't want it i don't know we try to recognize the nature

00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:20.400
 of that physical sensation and in terra vada buddhism the nature of all conditioned phenomena

00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:26.720
 is impermanent so we're recognizing the impermanent nature of that felt sensation

00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:32.800
 instead of just trying to cultivate a certain type of experience and that which would just

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:39.520
 continue the cycle with craving and then grasping trying to collect it becoming trying to act on it

00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:46.960
 and so that's one spot um the problem with that is that if we have to wait for all the other links

00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:52.560
 one through six to form that means we have half the cycle of samsara that has to arise every time

00:45:53.760 --> 00:46:00.480
 and so that's a longer path um and so the second place to break the 12 links

00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:08.320
 is taught in Vajrayana and that's before the first link before ignorance or vijja which is

00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:18.640
 often known as ma rigpa in tibetan that's why the link is broken with rigpa non-ignorance or wisdom

00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:25.600
 and if the technique is like there's all these techniques if we can recognize a state of non-ignor

00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:25.920
ance

00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:33.200
 or of rigpa then that prevents the ma rigpa or ignorance from happening and then the whole cycle

00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:39.360
 breaks right there and we don't have to go through the next 12 links of conditioned existence or

00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:45.520
 suffering we actually break it before the cycle starts and that's why they say there's two paths

00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:51.040
 a knowing or not knowing and these high high level teachings it's either rigpa or not rigpa

00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:58.000
 and that's where Vajrayana breaks the cycle of the 12 links and then I ask Rinpoche's well if

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:05.440
 you break the cycle of the 12 links does the rest of the cycle continue as pure relative truth

00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:12.240
 so if you break if you don't have ignorance ma rigpa instead you have rigpa or a knowing

00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:18.560
 quality of the nature of conditioned existence dependent arising the energy of awareness still

00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:25.680
 does continue and it arises purely and that's where you get pure body and pure speech in Vajrayana

00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:31.520
 Buddhism so those two points are really helpful because to know where to actually break the links

00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:36.000
 either with a physical sensation and then recognizing its impermanent nature that's

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:41.920
 Satipatthana sutra that's mindfulness of body actually the Buddha taught in the suttas or sutras

00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:48.160
 and then all the Vajrayana techniques are based on breaking the link or disrupting the link the

00:47:48.160 --> 00:48:01.600
 cycle before it starts it before link one yes merit and wisdom

00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:10.640
 so we'll start our nundra practice thank you
