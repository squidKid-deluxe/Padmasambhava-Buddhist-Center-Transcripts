 Again, good morning, and welcome everyone. Again, thank you. This is one of the again beautiful,

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:16.000
 glorious days in the Southern Florida, beautiful sunshine. Truly, we are also very beautiful,

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:22.000
 glorious days, very connecting back to the teaching and the practice that what we've been

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:22.000
 practicing.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:28.000
 So therefore, again, I'd like to thank you very much everyone, and good morning.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 Bon adiÃ³s, and to everyone, wherever you're connected, wherever you are, are looking,

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:40.000
 watching, oh, curiosity, and I wish truly from the bottom of my heart,

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 rest in understanding of the Buddha teaching, or glorify your already knowledge, understand.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 Somebody is refreshed so that we can always continue to move forward on the track,

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:59.000
 not disturbed, delayed, discouraged, always bounce back with courage and commitment,

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:05.000
 confidence with full of joy and full of goals, beautiful goals. This is advancing,

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:12.000
 adventure. The goal of the Buddha's heart is part of love, compassion, kindness,

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:19.000
 joy, and peace, and rewarding to each other. Truly, it is. It's nothing. It's non-violence.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.000
 It's true. We're touching back with our nature. That's what the teaching is all about.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 Our own nature. We're not creating any dogmas so that we become realistic,

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 truly born, drawn to the earth, and discover our innate beauty.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:42.000
 Let the radiating from our heart and the sunshine, and shine that truth everywhere, wherever we go.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 That is our goal. That is our wish. And that is our destination.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 So therefore, it is beautiful. And to begin this again, of course, always in the new millennium,

00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:03.000
 every great master, and every time, the beginning of our practices,

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000
 whether we are practicing, whether we are studying, whether we are contemplating,

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:13.000
 whether we are meditating in the practices, we should be strengthening our beautiful

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 motivation of both each other and joy and appreciation.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:26.000
 That very is the foundation of the practices. That very is the center column of the practices.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:32.000
 And that very is our destination to discover when you reach Buddhahood, it's full of joy,

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:41.000
 full of appreciation, and full of relax, peace, harmony. That is what Buddhahood is.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 We begin from now, from today, that practice, not waiting somewhere and can't catch up there.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:55.000
 Right now, this is our nature. Therefore, we strengthen all those beautiful qualities,

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000
 beautiful intention, and thinking of all the sentient beings.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 Motherly sentient beings always say, thinking of all motherly sentient beings,

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.000
 for to help and to remove their suffering and difficulties, and for all their wishes.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:15.000
 Therefore, I am going to practicing, I am going to listen, teaching, contemplating that.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 That is truly from our heart. It is not just live, service, talking.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 From the bottom of our heart, really, we are thinking that.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000
 And it's the same thing with that old thought, together with the understanding of the

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:34.000
 Vedayana teaching. Also, apply this, kind of bring up the realization of the truly beautiful,

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000
 the beauty and understanding of the naturals, known as three various states,

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:45.000
 various forms, various sounds, various spaces, various natures.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:51.000
 Bring up that realization, combine it together, then we move forward with the teachings and

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 practices.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:58.000
 And so, those are very important with that. And then, now the teaching itself, we move that.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000
 But I am going to talk really about how this teaching comes.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000
 So, this is always, of course, many of you already know, we all know,

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000
 this teaching comes from the Buddha Shakyamuni.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:14.000
 But remembering of the kindness and the compassion of the Buddha that did.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000
 And that's what his teaching, so really glorifying appreciate of him.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:23.000
 So, therefore, we think of him, talking about few words about the Buddhas.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:30.000
 And we say this again, Buddha came, this world, or in India, about 2,600 years ago.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 And the Buddha, then, he left the kingdom at 39, sorry 29, and reached enlightenment at 35.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:47.000
 After reaching the enlightenment, then, or become absolutely Buddha, or total enlightenment,

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:54.000
 then, 49 days after his enlightenment, he began sharing his realization and understanding

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000
 at the first time at Varanasi.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:04.710
 Five human students, and 80,000 celestial beings, and as well as many animals, and all those things

00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:05.000
.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 And Buddha gave the first teaching known as the Four Noble Truth Teachings,

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000
 and at Noble Path Teachings.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000
 Those of Buddha gave those teachings.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:21.150
 And from that on, then, he continually started giving the teaching until he entered Mahabharata in

00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:22.000
 Varanasi.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 The Buddha gave teaching over 45 years, continually Buddha gave the teachings over 45 years.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:37.000
 And then, in a minute time, the Buddha gave, known as the teachings of the Tapandya Paramata,

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.250
 that which is beyond the character states, or absolute true naturals, Buddha expounded that

00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:43.000
 teachings.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:48.000
 At the third time, he started giving the teachings of the, and the nature of the true,

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 inherent nature, that each and every living being inherent.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:59.000
 He mentioned this Buddha and all the living beings, there is no really difference between at all

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 the natural levels.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000
 We all have the same nature. We all have the same potential.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:10.000
 Because of that potential, because of that nature, Buddha himself, he said,

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000
 walked hard for that, that, and become the Buddha.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:20.000
 And where he walked, also, according to nature, what he inherited, to line up that nature,

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:26.430
 not just something doing alien things or strange things, but exactly lined up to the natural way it

00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:27.000
 is.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:35.000
 Nature of our mind is according to Buddha's teaching, it's love, it's compassion, it's wisdom.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:43.420
 That is love and compassion, wisdom, that has no territories, no boundaries, that's the innate

00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:44.000
 nature.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.000
 That has to be reworded, and that is, in order to reword that nature, hard to do.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:54.690
 That is what Buddha gave the bodhicata teachings, namahayana teachings. That's what he mentioned

00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:55.000
 there.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:00.000
 So then, as Buddha gave all those teachings, and the teachings always said,

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000
 the great master said, Buddha completely everything what he had to do.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:10.000
 He completed all the teachings that Buddha had to do in his lifetime, or that time.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.000
 Completed, and then he entered Mahabharata in the runners.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 Also, Buddha showed exactly where things are.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:21.000
 Things are calm, stay, go, it's part of the natural systems.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:28.000
 There is that, in order to demonstrate that, in order to show that nature,

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.000
 and then Buddha entered Mahabharata in the runners.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.000
 And after Buddha entered Mahabharata in the runners, so many great masters,

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.130
 so many great practitioners who practiced and meditated, they spread his teachings message to

00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:41.000
 everywhere.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:47.000
 Not just through the violence, through the forceful, but through the love, through the joy.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 Everyone who ever heard these teachings, they all connected to these teachings.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.000
 They thought, so beautiful, because they connected their own heart, their own teachings.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000
 They heard something strange, or different things talking, because it's in the nature.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.000
 Therefore, whoever heard these teachings, everyone likes to be practiced.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000
 Everyone welcomes their teachings.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:14.000
 So therefore, Buddha's teachings spread out from the ordinary places,

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.000
 as grass fire to everywhere, in all areas.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.000
 Everywhere spread it.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000
 And that is how the Buddhists continue to carry it.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:29.000
 And then, at the same time, around the 8th century, then the Buddhism came to Tibet,

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.000
 or even before the 7th century, Buddhism came to Tibet.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:39.000
 But 8th century, by the great master, Gaurabhema Sambhava, and Shandara Kita,

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 and the great King Busan Dethi, these three are known as, as many of you know,

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000
 known as, then, the founders of the Tibet Buddhists.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:54.000
 They completely bought all the Buddhisms from the original Buddha's teachings,

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000
 or Theravada, or known as the Shravakayana teachings,

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:06.000
 all the Latin Mahayati teachings, Nayana teachings, the whole body of the teachings.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:14.000
 In other words, the Buddha gave the teachings as 35, under 81 or 80.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 That whole teaching brought to Tibet without any discrimination or sorting out,

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 brought every teachings.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.000
 That all teachings are known as, in the Nyingma teachings, known as Nayana teachings.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.000
 So it brought all that teachings, completed.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000
 Not just they brought the teachings, but they translated the entire teachings

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 and put that into practice, put that into studying, and contemplating, and meditating.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:48.000
 Because of that, there are so many great beings, got the highest realization,

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:53.000
 so one after another, and those are known as, then, 25 disciples from the Gaurabhema Sambhava,

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:59.000
 and as well as the 80 Mahasadas of the Yerba regions, and so forth.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000
 So many great masters came.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:08.300
 And from that on, then the Buddhism continued to intubate and spread out so beautifully, so

00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:09.000
 perfectly,

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000
 and so many great masters came, one after another,

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.000
 and then those are known as, then, four major schools, whatever the Buddhisms.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:24.000
 Kind of continually expanded from that, and then there's more other sub-schools, too.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.000
 There's so many schools.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.000
 But everyone began to practice, meditate, and combine together.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:35.000
 Entire Buddha teachings, such as the Thera Buddha teachings, Mahayana teachings,

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:42.000
 Mahayana teachings, all combined, and whole body of the practices began to completely practice.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000
 And then, particularly, in the Niyama school, and practice whole,

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000
 that body of Niyana teachings practices, meditate, and their realizations.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.000
 And those lineages are maintained by the two systems, as many of you all know,

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:59.000
 known as the Kama and the Therma lineage, continually, until now.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:04.000
 So many great masters, so many great practitioners are keeping this teaching, continuing.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:10.000
 So that's how this teaching continues.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000
 Among this teaching, among all those great masters, today,

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:20.000
 we're going to talk with these 37 practices of the Bodhisattvas.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:26.000
 This is, again, in the context of the Niyanas, Niyana teachings,

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.000
 Shravakayana, Parthika-Buddhayana, and Bodhisattva-Yanas, everything.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:37.000
 And Bodhisattva-Yana, these are the teachings of the Bodhisattva-Yanas teachings,

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000
 all commonly, generally, known as Mahayana teachings.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:47.000
 So this is the essential teachings, or the practice of the Mahayana teachings.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:57.000
 And who taught these teachings? By one of the great masters, Hermitage of the Jersey, Murtu Tomi.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000
 Murtu Tomi, which is already here.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 He came, I think, around 14 centuries, I think.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:18.000
 He was born, I think, in 1295, and he entered Mahaparin nirvana in 1369.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:26.000
 And he was, I think, he stayed about 74 years around that.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:34.000
 He was one of the great master's teachers, and also Hermitage, according to his stories.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:39.000
 He was very Hermitage. He was very humble and simple.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:49.000
 But he would be practicing these, Bodhisattva practices, become one of the essential practices.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:58.000
 And the teachings say that when he was born, even in childhood, he was so compassionate, so kind,

00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:58.000
 so compassionate,

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:04.000
 concerning all the beings, everyone. He didn't really care too much himself.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000
 He was thinking how to help the central beings.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:19.540
 As that genuine compassion in his heart, in his mind, then he, when he entered the practice, when

00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:24.000
 he was growing up, that was his catch-up practices.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:29.770
 He started that time, started and contracted with the great master's, he became one of the great

00:30:29.770 --> 00:30:31.000
 scholars too.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:36.670
 And one of the great master's asked so many different questions, particularly in the Abhidharma

00:30:36.670 --> 00:30:40.000
 questions, in the teachings said, when he was young.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:49.210
 And he answered everything, without any pause, without any stopping, or without any kind of

00:30:49.210 --> 00:30:52.000
 shortages, he answered everything.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:59.680
 And therefore, then this great master named, "Oh, you have no blockage, no kind of shortages, no

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:01.000
 shortages."

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:10.000
 And that was what his name became, Tomi in the Tibetan. Tomi means one don't have any pause.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:15.000
 - Pause. - Pause. He don't pause, or he's not really shortage of the answers.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:22.330
 He don't have any, that he's answered everything so clearly, so perfectly beautiful, and says, then

00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:27.000
 this is, is, "Jersi Murchu Tomi Zangwati."

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.000
 That's Parzambhu, so that's what his name.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:38.410
 And then also, the great master said, he was emanation of the Genesis, the Lord of Compassion, or

00:31:38.410 --> 00:31:41.000
 the Buddha of Compassion.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:48.790
 So truly, he is the emanation of compassion, but his practice was truly both each other's practices

00:31:48.790 --> 00:31:50.000
, all the time.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:57.190
 That was his practices. His love and kindness of compassion is true, so much to all the sentient

00:31:57.190 --> 00:31:59.000
 beings, without any discriminations.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.000
 He belongs with the new schools of the Tibetan Buddhism.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:13.180
 As he said in Tibetan Buddhism, there are four major schools, such as Nungma, Kaju, Satcha, and Gel

00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:14.000
os.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:22.800
 So, he belongs with the new schools, particularly, I think more, in Gelos, at that time, maybe Gel

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:24.000
os was not that tightly existing,

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:31.770
 but these Tadam schools, and as well as Satcha schools, such many great masters, he started to

00:32:31.770 --> 00:32:34.000
 create many masters from the Satcha schools.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:42.670
 So, he was, in a way, that, but his practice was generally compassion practices, and as well as Bod

00:32:42.670 --> 00:32:45.000
hisattva Charya Avataras,

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:51.320
 and which is known as the guide to the way and the lives of the Bodhisattva by great master Shanti

00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:52.000
 Devas.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:58.000
 That was his, one of the principle practices, and his meditations, that.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:05.000
 So, that is, then, the essence toward these teachings, teachings, these teachings become so popular

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.000
 for all schools of the Tibetan Buddhism.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:15.670
 It's not just only one side. This practices widely to everyone, because it touched to the very core

00:33:15.670 --> 00:33:19.000
 of compassion, very loving kindness.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:25.000
 We can always talk about exchanging, receiving, exchanging.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:32.000
 This explaining the exchanging, how we should stay. So, stone and compassion, never mind.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:38.000
 Whatever situation, circumstance, or the difficulty came, challenge coming from outside.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:45.000
 But our compassion should not lost it. We always kind of take the hand of that very well.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:50.000
 Whatever the necessity, whatever the difficulty comes, comes.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:56.000
 And that is what this teaching says. Of course, we will go through, so you will read this.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:03.000
 This is so popular, so powerful practice to every practitioner.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:13.000
 So, that is really kind of like his story, how this teaching started, or how this came.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:19.000
 Now, we go to the text itself, so you will look to this text.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:26.000
 And this is now, according to the kind of intubate, when you study this, how they do.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:31.000
 And many times, what I learned from many great masters as well.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:39.460
 And when I had the opportunity to study, they always told, kind of like, anyway, the bird's eye w

00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:42.000
oos look into this text.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:48.000
 So, if we look to the bird's eye woos, this teaching is divided into three groups.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000
 The beginning, the middle, and ending.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:58.000
 What is the beginning of this? That beginning is the title. Title of the teachings.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:04.000
 Then, principle body of the teachings. And what is the end is the color forms.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:11.000
 So, those are how to kind of lay out this. So, three first topics we go.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:17.000
 So, now, we go to look to these titles. And that is then already translated here.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:22.000
 The 37 practices of the Bodhisattvas. This is what.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:33.000
 And here, Bodhisattva, with Bodhisattvas, Bodhisattva, every translated into English.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:39.000
 Courageous ones for enlightenment. That is the word Bodhisattvas.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:49.000
 Bodhi is enlightenment. Sattva is courageous. The courageous for enlightenment.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:55.000
 That tells, again, to us, to us, to reach enlightenment.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:04.000
 To help important sentient beings, we have to be courageous. We cannot be timid.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:12.130
 We are also courageous. That means we are not going to control, preserving, protecting our self-

00:36:12.130 --> 00:36:14.000
importance.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:23.000
 Self-importance. We are not going to also try to pay too much attention with our own ego-clinging.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:30.000
 We are going to, in a way, put sides of our ego-clinging.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:38.000
 And along with the ego-clinging's important wish, demand is self-importance.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:44.000
 So, we are going to put sides. To do this, then, is courageous.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:49.000
 This is courageous. This is how long we are going to keep this courageous.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:56.000
 Always, teaching says, this courageous we are going to keep for a long time this courageous.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:03.000
 We are not just keeping the courageous and practicing this only for our purposes, our own sex.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:10.000
 We are practicing the Bodhisattva practices for all the sentient beings.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.000
 And how many sentient beings there?

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:20.000
 Always, the teaching says it is numberless, countless.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:29.200
 And so, we are going to keep the courageous until every sentient beings reach enlightenment or

00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:31.000
 become the Buddha.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:36.000
 So, this means it is the long-lasting goal of the courageous.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.000
 And we will continually keep this.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:46.000
 So, therefore, in a number level of the beings, it is countless.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:53.000
 Time level is also no time, actually.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:59.000
 We are going to practice to always keep the courageous.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:06.000
 As Jainese, Jainese is known as a rich enlightenment. Jainese is the Buddha.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:11.000
 Absolutely, that is what is called the Buddha of compassion.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:19.000
 But this Buddha of compassion, always in the teaching says, he becomes a state as Bodhisattvas.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:27.000
 Because of his compassion, his love and kindness, his concern and thought for all the living beings

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:27.000
,

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:31.000
 he is a state as Bodhisattvas.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.000
 So, Jainese is a role model.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:42.430
 And also when you help the sentient beings, sentient beings, sentient beings are not always easy to

00:38:42.430 --> 00:38:43.000
 help.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:47.000
 That I think many of you know, maybe sometimes.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:53.000
 And they can be stubborn. Not just they are stubborn, we are stubborn too.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:59.000
 Ourself, the moral image is back and forth, it is not just one side.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:05.000
 So, learn from the sentient beings. Improve ourself.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:12.000
 Learn from the sentient beings. Next time, stand to yourself, ourself.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:16.000
 Learn courage and commitment and confidence.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.000
 For that reason, it is called Sattvas, Bodhisattvas.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:25.000
 To become ourself, we need courageous.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:30.000
 And to help to the other sentient beings, we need courageous.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:36.000
 Courage and confidence is always so important.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:43.000
 That is the central column of the strength and vitality of the practices.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:49.800
 When you help to the compassion activities, generally, always, that is strengthening your suffering

00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:50.000
.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:55.000
 Compassion activity of the compassion is like vitamins, always the great masters.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:01.000
 It is like power drinks. When you do the compassion activities, it feels so happy.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:07.000
 It makes you repress yourself. You feel something important, that I did something.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:14.000
 The reward in doing this is so good. It makes happy others. It makes happy you.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.000
 For that reason, the great Master, Shanti Deva, what is it?

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:23.000
 Riding Bodhisattva is like riding the joyful ride.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:29.000
 Bodhisattva, part of the Bodhisattva is joyful ride, ride.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:33.000
 With this joyful ride, there is no sufferings.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:41.250
 From now on, when we have the genuine Bodhisattva in our heart, from that on, we move from joy to

00:40:41.250 --> 00:40:42.000
 joy.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:47.000
 Happy to the happy, peace to the peace, rewarding to the reward.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.000
 Rewarding and to ourselves, to others.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:57.530
 For that reason, this great Master, why we will be discouraged to perform the Bodhisattva

00:40:57.530 --> 00:40:59.000
 activities.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:05.000
 This is what it is. So therefore, this is Bodhisattva's.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.000
 So that is the breathing. Then, Bodhi is enlightenment.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.000
 And enlightenment is absolutely total enlightenment.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:17.000
 Enlightenment means what? Prefer all the obscurations.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:23.000
 That much, in the Buddha teaching always, how many obscurations can be summarized.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:30.020
 Of course, there are many different ways to explain, but all the obscurations can be summarized

00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:31.000
 into two.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:35.000
 Those are the emotional obscurations, knowledge obscurations.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:41.000
 So, free all the emotional obscurations. That includes the ego clingings.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:45.000
 Ego clingings is the obscurations, is the obstacles.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:49.000
 What the great Master, Gurbel Masambha said in his teachings,

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:53.000
 then Kanchi Rama, which takes many times, quotations on Kanchi, Bodhi Chara Rama,

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:58.000
 takes many times quotations that Gurbel Masambha said.

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.000
 Ego is the most powerful demon, said.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:12.280
 This ego is the demon, the most powerful demon that must be scared away, let it go out, or kick out

00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:14.000
 that, that.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:21.000
 And then as well as everyone, every great Master, everyone says ego is the demon.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:26.000
 From now, from the beginning of this time, until now, it's been disturbing us.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:32.000
 To your, ourselves, it's disturbing. It's disturbing others.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.000
 Been disturbing continuously. This.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:41.000
 Now, we have to remove this. We have to kick out. Kick out.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:47.000
 So, when we remove the emotion obscurations, we remove the ego clingings, too.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:53.000
 Then knowledge obscurations, if I can simplify knowledge obscurations, what is this?

00:42:53.000 --> 00:43:03.000
 I can say grasping, clinging. Clinging is the knowledge obscurations that have been removed.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:11.000
 Though ego clinging is gross obscurations, clinging itself is subtle obscurations.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:16.000
 If both removed, what will be shining behind? What is left?

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:24.000
 Then true love, true compassion, true wisdom without any attachment, without any grasping.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:32.000
 Grasping. That is known as the unconditioned true love, true compassion, true wisdom.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:38.000
 That is what nature is. That, when you revert that, that is known as Buddha.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:48.000
 That. So, that is really about bodhisattvas. Now, to reach that realization, to make this happen,

00:43:48.000 --> 00:44:00.000
 then this great Master explained there is 37 practices, or 37 related with this bodhisattvas.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:07.000
 That 37 stanzas explained one after another. This is the practice of bodhisattva.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:12.000
 This is practice of bodhisattva. He is kind of pointing out one after another.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:19.000
 Then, all these 37 stanzas here, one after another, these teachings.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:25.000
 So, that is really about the title. Kind of an explanation of the title.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:31.000
 And now, we got the main body of this teaching, the principal body of the teachings.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:37.000
 The principal body of the teachings, then again, we look kind of now, in a way,

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:40.000
 we are now looking into the bird's eye, but we zoom in.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:45.000
 More zoom in, and look to this text. To this text.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.000
 Now, we zoom in, now to the principal body, what is here.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:57.000
 First is, then, there is always in the teaching, those great Master, when they give the teaching,

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:00.000
 there is always known as homage teachings.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:07.000
 Homage and respecting and appreciating of the lineage of where this teaching comes from.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:11.000
 So, appreciating that. Remember their kindness.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:19.000
 That. And so, that is first. And then, second, they always talk, most of the text has this.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:24.000
 And second, that I am committed to finish what I started.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:29.000
 This is called, sometimes, commitment, sometimes, promise.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:32.000
 But always, so this is the second that.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:38.000
 The third is, then, the principal body of the teachings.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:41.000
 And explaining. So, we got those.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:46.000
 And now, so with that understanding, now we go to the homage.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:52.000
 Homage, then, this text or this practicing, there is two homages.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:57.000
 Homage in Sanskrit language, homage in Tibetan language.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:03.000
 There is two homages. Or, paying respects.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:08.000
 Now, in Sanskrit language, namo loki shorad.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.000
 And the Tibetan language, of course, is already here.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.000
 And that is the English, then, English, translated here.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:19.000
 So, homage in Sanskrit and homage in English or the Tibetan language.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:22.000
 Languages. So, these two.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:33.000
 Now, first, we go to homage to the meaning, really meaning of this first quote.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:36.000
 The Sanskrit language.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.000
 Sanskrit language. And the Sanskrit language is already here.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:45.000
 It is already wrote, namo loki shoraya.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:49.000
 Shoraya. On the Tibetan, it says, shoraya, shoraya.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:57.360
 Namo loki shorayas. And now, if I can't relate, can't divide or split the words, meaning, namo is

00:46:57.360 --> 00:46:59.000
 homage.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:04.000
 Namo loki shoraya is the name of the ava loki shor, or the jainism.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:16.000
 So, that means, I pay homage to the ava loki shoraya, or I pay homage to the lord of compassion.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.000
 The lord of compassion. That is the meaning.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:23.000
 And namo, now, bhijandere li pay homage.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.000
 Homage means, or nam, what that means?

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:31.000
 Homage means respecting and appreciating.

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:39.000
 And that means, when you respect and appreciate means, then also we are making ourself more humble.

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:47.360
 What's called humility? Humility is more humble. We are deeply moved by the call of such great

00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:52.000
 masters, those great teachings, great beauties.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:57.000
 And that's what I humbled by this.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:06.000
 When we are humbled, what it does? It reduces our arrogance, our doubt and hesitations.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:11.000
 When it reduces our doubt and hesitation, arrogance, what it does?

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:17.000
 Then it brings more confidence, more joy, more certainties.

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:24.000
 And then we really begin to absorb knowledge and blessings, or the knowledge into our mind streams.

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:31.140
 So, we are kind of preparing situation, circumstances, more clearly that to absorb the sunlight of

00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:35.000
 the knowledge, blessing can enter our mind streams.

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:41.000
 Streams. So, that is the general meaning of homages.

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:46.000
 It's very important. The arrogance is then one of the five poisons.

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:50.000
 And we listed five poisons in the arrogance one.

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:56.260
 And arrogance is always teaching. Those great masters said it's just always disturbance, always

00:48:56.260 --> 00:48:57.000
 disturbs.

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:01.000
 And so, that's namo. That's brilliant.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:05.800
 And then with homages, many great masters, I mean, generally there's three different ways to homage

00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:08.000
, pay respects.

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:14.620
 Those highly realized beings, homage is known as understanding of the true nature, exactly as it is

00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:15.000
.

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:20.820
 Beyond the subject, object and action. Maintaining the perfectly natural of the mind or realization

00:49:20.820 --> 00:49:22.000
 of true nature.

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:26.000
 That is great homage. Absorbing the knowledge.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:32.000
 And then in the second is known as the homage of the meditation ways, or understanding.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:37.000
 And see, everything is the beauty, the perfect mandala of the Buddha's, according to Vajrayana,

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000
 everything is the beauty in the display status.

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:43.000
 Or in the sattara teaching, everything is a mirage. Everything is a dream.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:49.000
 Everything can be that understanding and bring our genuine kind of respect and appreciation.

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:56.580
 That is, is homages. And then regular homages are under deep, kind of knowing, beautiful knowledge

00:49:56.580 --> 00:49:57.000
 in the college.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:01.000
 College of all these great masters, particularly Genesis.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:07.880
 Genesis is a compassion. And the compassion of the Genesis is, has no boundary, no limitation to

00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:09.000
 all the time.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:14.000
 So, it feels really extremely genuine, kind of like, respect and appreciate.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:22.000
 And then, say, namo lokeshwarahe. And lokeshwarahe, if we translate it, if we translate it, Lord of

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:22.000
, what's the quote?

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:30.260
 Lord of the universe, or Lord, mighty, powerful ones. And the mighty, powerful one means, then,

00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:33.000
 compassion.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:38.680
 Actually, don't do the compassion. Compassion is the most powerful. There is nothing more powerful

00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:40.000
 than the compassion.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:47.000
 It's to heal, to remove the obscurations, to bring the joy and peace, happiness, to make happy me,

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.000
 bring happy others.

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:54.000
 That's the compassion. So, there is nothing more powerful, more special than the compassion.

00:50:54.000 --> 00:51:01.940
 So, to that is Genesis and I pay homages. So, that is really about this meaning of the Sanskrit

00:51:01.940 --> 00:51:03.000
 language.

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:10.290
 And now, we move to the next one, the English. That's the next one. Then we'll translate it into

00:51:10.290 --> 00:51:11.000
 English.

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:19.790
 You see that all the phenomena neither come nor go. And still, you strive solely for the benefit of

00:51:19.790 --> 00:51:21.000
 the beings.

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:31.000
 "Supreme guru and product of generosity, to you I continually bow with body, speech, and mind."

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:37.000
 That is longer stance and homage. Homage. Pay respect.

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:46.250
 We praise this, we praise, then we pay homage. How praise this by great Master Mooji Tommi. How

00:51:46.250 --> 00:51:47.000
 praise?

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:54.000
 And he prays the understanding of all the absolute nature by the genocide.

00:51:54.000 --> 00:52:00.000
 And then yet, he's also how thoughtful to all the beings.

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:06.000
 Even he realizes the absolute nature perfectly exactly as it is.

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:14.000
 But yet, he's so particular, so thoughtful, looking every sentient beings.

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:23.300
 And we don't neglect any sentient beings by your compassion. Therefore, I pay respect. I humbled by

00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:24.000
 you.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:30.000
 And so, I pay respect by the speech-mind. That is really that.

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:39.000
 So now, first we look again. You see that all phenomena neither come nor go.

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:45.000
 What is this? This is absolute nature of the truth.

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:51.720
 What the great Master Nagarjuna said in his first teaching, that we join always in hard suttas here

00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:52.000
.

00:52:52.000 --> 00:53:07.320
 Everything arises interdependently and the nature is what? Unceasing and unborn. Neither non-

00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:10.000
existing nor everlasting.

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:19.000
 And neither coming nor going. Neither several meanings nor single meanings.

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:26.000
 This is known as ad-complexity. Nature is free from the ad-complexity.

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:38.000
 In Tibet, that is what nature is free from.

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:43.000
 That is what nature is free from all that.

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:51.000
 Reality level, true nature is bound of this ad-complexity status. Totally.

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:57.360
 If you look, that's what it means. If you look carefully at those coming and going, birth and not

00:53:57.360 --> 00:53:58.000
 birth,

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:03.000
 each of that, we're not going to find any singular source.

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:12.000
 It's all great emptiness status. Great economic status. Absolutely. Everything.

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:18.000
 That we can apply to your own mind. If you give kind of not philosophical level, kind of like

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:20.000
 although all external how to,

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:27.000
 everything is free from ad-extremes or ad-complexities, that's how the great Master Nagarjuna

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:29.000
 established it.

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:37.000
 So, everything is established at zoking levels to your mind, to your own mind.

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:44.000
 If you look to your mind, where your first and second thought came from, where it's coming, where

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.000
 it's went,

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:53.000
 you read your own mind or there's many and there's no singular.

00:54:53.000 --> 00:55:01.150
 Do you think in applying this teaching of Nagarjuna's, apply it to your mind, we reach to the

00:55:01.150 --> 00:55:03.000
 speechless status.

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:11.000
 There's nothing more than, except speechless. That's the beginning of the teaching we joined.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:25.000
 Inconceivable, inexpressible, unborn, unceasing, natural, like by sky.

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:33.000
 That is the world realization. That's its true nature. That is true natural realization levels.

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:47.000
 Yet, everything is arising as interdependent, as strengthened. Everything is arising magically.

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:57.000
 Who taught that? That's taught by the Buddha. Therefore, you are the excellent speaker.

00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:05.000
 You are the excellent speaker among all the speakers. There's no one said like that.

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:13.000
 Before you Buddha, for that reason, I Nagarjuna, he said, I respect you.

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:23.480
 And here, this great Master just bought two, coming and going. All that goes beyond existing, non-

00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:27.000
existing, neither and either.

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:35.250
 Nature is that status. You realize that nature, perfectly, exactly as it is. That is your

00:56:35.250 --> 00:56:37.000
 realization.

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:44.770
 But, even everyone, we are all in that natural status. But, we don't have that realization because

00:56:44.770 --> 00:56:47.000
 of our duality,

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:53.530
 because of our grasping. We spoiled, we were kind of looking in one direction all the time and

00:56:53.530 --> 00:56:57.000
 narrowed, kind of made that natural.

00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:03.000
 And then, we are experienced as nightmares, situations.

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:13.000
 Even though the Chinese are natural, our natural, it's not different nature. It's the same nature.

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:19.000
 But yet, there is two-way experience.

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:26.060
 Generation is this dream, interdependent coordination. It displays magical status. For us,

00:57:26.060 --> 00:57:34.000
 everything is so strong, so solid, so regiment, so kind of like bouncing back and forth.

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:41.830
 We are crushed by this externally, internally, emotionally. Many levels are like this, always kind

00:57:41.830 --> 00:57:43.000
 of bouncing.

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:49.000
 That's our, our, for that reason. You, Genesee, you have that realization of the true nature,

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:51.000
 exactly as it is.

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:58.680
 But yet, for us, ignorant beings, all beings, you're so thoughtful, so, so kind. Your love and

00:57:58.680 --> 00:58:03.000
 kindness and compassion is never neglected us and say,

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:07.280
 "Oh, it's just like a nightmare dream. It's nothing happened." He never said that, Genesee. And

00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:11.000
 each and every time, Genesee is helping us.

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:19.400
 So how kind, how special it is. That Genesee is not separate than my teacher. The teacher and the

00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:22.000
 Genesee is inseparable status.

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:28.480
 Treat that great teacher. Realization as that, but comparing, out-reaching, comparing, it's to

00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:34.000
 every living being, so kind and so nice.

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:41.240
 Not compassion is coming as like, as like possible, as a boss, but so thoughtful, as a service, as

00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:45.000
 a favor, as a friend, as friendship.

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:54.850
 And helping support and with love and joy, peace and compassion and understanding and so thoughtful

00:58:54.850 --> 00:58:58.000
, like friend level, you help me.

00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:08.020
 For that reason, then I was humbled. I'm humbled, humbled, and therefore I respect with body,

00:59:08.020 --> 00:59:12.000
 respect with speech, respect with mind.

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:17.880
 Mind. What is respect of the body? Always in the teaching set. Set, that's what we do. Respect,

00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:22.000
 gesture of the respect of the body is like this.

00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:32.000
 All ball stations, all in the different style, say, what's called a shag hand, all say, "Hi."

00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:37.000
 All those are the different kind of gestures of the respect.

00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:45.000
 Matter is all, all ball stations. And respect of the speech is, then saying kind words, "Oh, hi."

00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:53.670
 "Hi," with this smiling face. Face, those are respect of the, and then he has said, "Oh, kind of

00:59:53.670 --> 00:59:55.000
 seeing these things."

00:59:55.000 --> 01:00:01.000
 It's respect. And respect of the mind is, then, joy and appreciation.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:10.000
 Generally, I'm deeply moved. I'm deeply moved. We call it a view. That is respect of this.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:15.000
 So, for that reason, I respect. Go sampkiva. Go sampkiva.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:21.920
 This is in Tibet, and in the Buddha's teaching, always the continued bow with body, speech, mind of

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:23.000
 the three doors.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.000
 Even though it's not exactly translated here, but three doors.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:31.000
 Why say three doors? In Tibet, we have three doors. And why this three doors?

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:38.660
 Because this three doors means metaphors. This body, speech, mind, in a way, entrance of our

01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:40.000
 activities.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.000
 Everything goes through this. Our mind activity goes with mind.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:49.000
 And our mind activity also comes more kind of actively with speech.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:54.930
 It's coming and going. So, it's the entrance. And the body is the entrance there with all the

01:00:54.930 --> 01:00:56.000
 activities.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:03.570
 Our activities, we can summarize the good activities and not good activities, or beneficial

01:01:03.570 --> 01:01:04.000
 activities,

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:12.600
 un-beneficial activities, or neutral activities that all function and reflect through these three

01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:13.000
 ways.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:16.000
 And therefore, it's like doors in the teaching system.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:30.000
 So, that is really about the, really about the, about the homages.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:35.000
 And now, maybe we, I just go really over this second stanza, really this.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:44.170
 And that is then, this is now commitment. I am willing to start this teaching, and I'm going to

01:01:44.170 --> 01:01:45.000
 finish.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:49.000
 This is what it means. And always, so that is what.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:56.090
 So, the perfect Buddha, source of the benefit in happiness, arrives from the, accomplishing the

01:01:56.090 --> 01:01:57.000
 genuine dharma.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:07.730
 Since that is to, to depend on knowing how to practice, the practice of the bodhisattva shall be

01:02:07.730 --> 01:02:09.000
 explained.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:16.000
 That is the English translators. If I roughly translate in my own way, the, all the source of the

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:23.000
 happiness and benefit of now and the future is, comes from the teaching by the Buddha.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:26.000
 Teaching comes from that, by the teaching of the Buddhas.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:32.060
 And also, even though it comes from the teaching, or the teaching of the Buddha, but it is, if you

01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:36.000
 don't know how to practice, then it won't make the full benefit.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:43.680
 For that reason, I'm going to explain. I'm going to teach you, or tell you, the old, what practices

01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:47.000
 shall be performed by the bodhisattvas.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.000
 All the vectority sounds. So that is what it means.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:57.000
 So first is the, the, explain the importance and how powerful or special the Buddha teaching is.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:03.900
 This, this. That means happiness, peaceful happiness, good things now and forever. It comes from

01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:06.000
 the teaching of the Buddha.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:11.460
 Now we think this, what that really means, it's making kind of like, arrogant statement, or the

01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:15.000
 Buddha teaching is so special, and that's the only one.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:21.000
 Maybe this is so much kind of ambitious, making big statement, maybe a little bit more, too much,

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:25.000
 much about the, because the Buddhism is so special and so important.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:32.440
 Is it explaining? Or is it really true? And we can think this, this. But now, if it's everything

01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:39.000
 that way, and now why, why this great Master says Buddha teaching is the source of everything.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:44.950
 This is similar Shanti Deva explaining, we do dedication. Dedicated at the end of this phrase, we

01:03:44.950 --> 01:03:46.000
 always have that.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:53.940
 Similar things Shanti Deva said. Why this thing? It's just kind of too much statement. But we think

01:03:53.940 --> 01:03:58.000
 carefully, what is really Buddha teaching is.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:10.480
 Buddha teaching is genuine love, genuine compassion, genuine detachment. That's what really Buddha

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:12.000
 teaching is.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:21.420
 So, the genuine love, genuine compassion, genuine detachment to your own self, or to, by you, to

01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:25.000
 the other, to detachment, to anyone's.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:35.000
 This is truly is the source of every joy and peace. Because there is no ego involvement at all.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:43.970
 There is no ego involvement at all. That means there is nothing involved with ignorance, attachment

01:04:43.970 --> 01:04:46.000
, anger, jealous, arrogance.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:55.050
 If that is out of free, then why is it not? It's a source of joy and peace, happiness now and in

01:04:55.050 --> 01:04:56.000
 the future.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:06.060
 Who can deny? Who can argue with that? Love is love and compassion and wisdom or genuine detachment

01:05:06.060 --> 01:05:12.000
 is not a source of joy, peace, happiness now and in the future.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:21.910
 That is the word. But even though that is so special, this all comes from the practice of that,

01:05:21.910 --> 01:05:24.000
 comes from that.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:29.000
 Even though it's so special, we have to know how to practice.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:37.000
 If we don't know how to practice, then even if we have the perfect tools and the perfect resources,

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:44.000
 if we don't know exactly how to use this, then it can also become not full benefit.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:55.190
 It comes from this. Therefore, I, Jersingh or Satomi, going to explain that practices, starting

01:05:55.190 --> 01:05:56.000
 from this and going to finish this.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:04.000
 I'm going to finish. I'm determined. So that is the really about these explanations.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:12.000
 Okay. So that's my teaching. And I stop here. And again, thank very much to everyone participating.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:15.000
 And I wish you all the best in happiness.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:22.000
 May all we have some realization of this and everyone move forward with this as much as we can,

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:25.000
 with the compassion and love. And thank you very much.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:33.170
 Pardon? And then the next two weeks, I will continue this. This and those who have time to

01:06:33.170 --> 01:06:36.000
 reconnect again, I will be very happy.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:43.200
 We will go as much as we can, according to my best capabilities, and talk these things as much as

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:44.000
 we can.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:50.010
 And be together and connected together is so wonderful, so great. I'm so happy we have this

01:06:50.010 --> 01:06:53.000
 technology, modern, and so thankful. Okay.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:58.000
 Thank you everyone. Thank you. Thank you everyone. Thank you. Thank you.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:06.600
 Again, we do that through meditating. And then we do maybe, again, dedication in English. So we won

01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:08.000
't take too time.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:14.000
 But that's why we do short meditation.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:08:00.000
 Thank you.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:16.000
 Thank you.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:09:07.000
 Thank you.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:33.000
 Okay. Now we dedicate the merit.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:10:01.000
 And.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:32.000
 And.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:58.000
 And.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:26.000
 And.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:54.000
 And.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:12:22.000
 And.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:50.000
 And.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:13:18.000
 And.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:47.000
 And.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:14:15.000
 And.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:42.000
 And.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:15:11.000
 And.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:40.000
 And.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:16:08.000
 And.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:36.000
 And.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:17:04.000
 And.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:32.000
 And.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:18:00.000
 And.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:23.000
 And.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:44.000
 Thank you.
