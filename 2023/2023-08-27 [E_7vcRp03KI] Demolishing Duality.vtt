00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.040
 Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Again, welcome everyone. Thank you. Now we, again,

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:22.000
 continue teaching on the Shirei, the Durya Mungo, the Chavu, the Evernus of the Vedas. Continue.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.980
 And today, I think we are on the page 16. I think the last line of the page is 16. Or two lines.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:43.170
 And again, in order to continue to follow, and again, to activate our motivations, and that is,

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:50.720
 again, so, the foundation of the practices of meditation, and as well as also is related for the

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.980
 achievement of our realization.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:59.600
 When we fully develop of the Durya in appreciation, free from all the, in the imprints of the

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.660
 grasping of the ego clinging, then really we are reaching enlightenment. We are reaching in high

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:13.290
 state. So therefore, Durya in appreciation, being grateful, all those are so, so important, and

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.980
 that is necessary with all, and then we lead, again, bodhicapam.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.840
 Kindness, compassion, thought, reaching good things for all, living beings, without any

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.250
 discrimination, from the very heart. When you feel that, not just really saying that, but reaching

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.980
 that from heart and praying for that, and by the blessings and all the Buddha and the Bodhisattva,

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:42.980
 every enlightenment, may I fulfill that goal, really reaching, sincerely from heart.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.130
 And those are known as the following footsteps of the old great Bodhisattvas, and the old linear

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:54.450
 master. That's what they practiced with that. And then, Buddhas in Bodhisattva. So, that is really

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.980
 so important, and that is part of the practice itself.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:04.980
 Without that, again, we won't go any further, further realization and understanding.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:11.990
 And with that, and then bring realization of the great three Kaya states, and all in three Kaya,

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:17.980
 all in three Vedas states, Dharma Kaya, Sambo Kaya, and then Ma Kaya states.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:24.980
 So bring that realization. And which we are discussing here, as or not we discuss for a great

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.980
 master of teaching, Siddha.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:34.430
 Master, do you look at the teaching, we are now going through all this, everything is empty, there

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.360
 is nothing existing, non-existing, one after another we are going through, and also we continue

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.980
 going this time, yesterday and today.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:51.530
 Reality, what is that? It's not nothingness states. And it's Dharma Kaya. As established in the

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.980
 Dharma Kaya, exactly as it is.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.980
 But at the same time, we don't have the realization of the Dharma Kaya or this great emptiness.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:07.980
 Great emptiness, Dharma Kaya, Dharma Dattu, absolute nature, all those are synonyms.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:16.980
 And there is many names in indestructible natures. Empties. This is not just a blank status.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:24.890
 All everything is nothing, nothing. That is negation, or that even the word negation is in Buddhism

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.980
 known as nihilism.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.980
 That is nihilism. Everything is not existing, it's all nothing existing.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:41.920
 That is an extreme view, view of extremes. Dzogkhi teaching, this is Dzogkhi teaching. Dzogkhi

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:48.980
 teaching is the middle part, the center of the nature, exactly as it is.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:59.840
 It's pre-pronged all extremes. What made the extremes? The permanent attitude and in permanent or

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.980
 nihilism attitude.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:09.670
 Those are the things you wanted. Another terminology, I'm sure you know those, eternalism, nihilism

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.980
.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:21.980
 Dzogkhi teaching is pre-pronged. Why? Because internalism, nihilism is not nature, it's extreme.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:29.980
 You want it to be extreme. Always like to be extreme, kind of carried forth with extreme.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:40.280
 It's easy to catch that than the non-attachment, no grasping. Because we are adopted that, we are

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.980
 harvested that from the biggest times, become extremist.

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:54.980
 But this time, this time, teaching what we are going through is demolishing that duality.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:01.080
 Because we like to hold, we like to grasp it, we like to think that is what teaching is going

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:06.980
 through here, and as well as in Buddha teaching, all the Pandya Parama teachings.

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:17.980
 No poem, no eye, no song. I mean, that's all. It's not kind of denying of the way things are.

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:25.980
 Exploring the way things are, the natures. That's what a religious teaching is.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:33.610
 So this teaching, what we are going through is Dzogkhi teaching, Absolute teaching, and Dzogkhi

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:34.980
 teaching means what?

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:41.980
 Dzogkhi has, when we do the practice, Dzogkhi has two aspects. Two aspects.

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:46.980
 Qadhartichu and Dzogapthogar. Those are roughly translated what?

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:55.980
 Pure from beginning is Qadhartichu. Emptiness, pure from the beginning, is emptiness.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:06.860
 Qadhartichu, all emptiness, all dharmadhatu, all the pervasive natures, a self-born awareness of

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.980
 the emptiness.

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:15.980
 And Dzogapthogar is spontaneously inherited, all the richness.

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:22.980
 But this time is going through, particularly this time. It's Qadhartichu teaching.

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:29.390
 In Dzogkhi teaching, that means on the meditation view, in the level of the meditation view, med

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:33.980
itating on the absolute nature of our own energy, nature.

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:39.980
 There is nothing to hold anything that exists that they can hold.

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:48.980
 Particularly for the beginners, for example, such as us, such us, we are beginner practitioners.

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:54.980
 Therefore, we don't immediately catch poem is emptiness, emptiness poem.

00:06:54.980 --> 00:07:01.980
 Even though reality is real, it is poem is emptiness, inseparable.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.980
 Where there is a poem, there is emptiness.

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:08.980
 For that reason, in the teaching of the opening meditation,

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:14.980
 relative truth and emptiness are identical, inseparable.

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:21.980
 Great Master Nagarjuna said, there is no emptiness beside relative truth.

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:30.980
 There is no absolute truth besides relative truth.

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:36.980
 Relative truth. But for us, we can't catch that immediately.

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:46.230
 Therefore, we are resting on the emptiness, can't relate more poem, because that will release the

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:47.980
 grasping and clinging.

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:54.980
 Clinging, it gets very, getting closer to the absolute nature. Exactly.

00:07:54.980 --> 00:08:02.170
 And those present times, our meditation is more can relate, analytic meditation with the

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:03.980
 conceptions.

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:13.980
 It's called the view of the analytic, view of the mind, view of the conception.

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:22.980
 When we continually meditate, continually meditate, then it holds view of the wisdom,

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:25.980
 view of the true nature.

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:33.980
 That moment, then, the everything, both relative truth and absolute truth are merging.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:37.980
 Same way. This is also in the teaching said.

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:46.980
 For example, Swatantar Madhima, great master Shandarachata, teach that.

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:51.980
 First, keep the teachings on everything is the emptiness.

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:54.980
 Can't break that emptiness realization.

00:08:54.980 --> 00:09:01.620
 Then finally, when you got the realization strong, that emptiness is not the name, that final

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:02.980
 stages.

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:06.980
 Go beyond the emptiness.

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:13.980
 Yes. So, first we say, there is no poem, no song, all those mentioned in that.

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:20.980
 But when you reach kind of good realization, then it's called beyond.

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:25.980
 Beyond, no poems, beyond poems.

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:35.980
 Those are in the philosophy of terminology used interpretable truth, uninterpretable truths.

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:39.980
 And I'm sure, I think there is a good kind of terminology.

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:44.980
 I believe that translated by many of us.

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:48.980
 So interpretable means something that you can catch in the mind,

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:51.980
 or everything is the emptiness.

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:53.980
 You can catch easily.

00:09:53.980 --> 00:10:00.980
 But beyond the emptiness, or beyond the existing, is something that totally opens,

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:06.980
 totally opens and totally releases in any duality form.

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:10.980
 A poem is an emptiness, still we can hold.

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:20.980
 We have almost like, we are colliding in the space with the, what's called those electric wings.

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:27.980
 We are gliding on the ocean, or we are surfing with the ocean with the surfing balls.

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:31.980
 But when you release that, then what?

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:36.980
 Those great surfers, or those who have the capability, really can surf.

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:41.980
 I call them teaching. I call them teaching. We've glided on the space.

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:47.980
 Space, but when you have the capabilities, then you can just fly.

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:50.980
 You don't have any sports.

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:54.980
 So this is like interpretable, it's absolutely true.

00:10:54.980 --> 00:11:06.370
 And in an uninterpretable truth, in the Tibetan, it says, "Nambriyib taw deva, nambriy māyib taw n

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:08.980
and deva, nambriyib taw nand deva, nambriyib taw nand deva."

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:12.980
 Those are, you can look to them in those Buddhist texts,

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:16.980
 and then so many things in these days and the next.

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:21.980
 So this time, this is what teaching here.

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:29.980
 And now here, kind of demolish of that duality, duality, all the grasping duality,

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:34.980
 and the aesthetic and the perfectly nature as it is Dharmakaya.

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:39.980
 Dharmakaya, and then for that reason here, said what?

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:42.980
 Said it. I mean, it's already said here.

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:45.980
 Are all expensive, best-less emptiness.

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:52.980
 All is leaded. So that is perfectly great emptiness in a Dharmakaya state.

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:56.980
 Dharmakaya or all Dharmakaya empty their realizations.

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:58.980
 When you get that realization.

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:03.980
 In that state, in that Dharmakaya state, or that great emptiness state,

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:09.980
 or great suneta in the Sanskrit state, then there is,

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:11.980
 then such as it's said what?

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:15.980
 And the settles, the scrubs, and the cause and the result,

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:21.980
 virtues and the null virtues, being helped by the gods and hung by the spirits,

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:27.980
 are the very natural, best-less, unimpeded openers.

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:32.980
 There is nothing existing, existing as by the duality.

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:39.980
 That means there is no borders. All is free. All is open.

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:43.980
 All is open. Here it's translated as no cause and a result.

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:48.980
 This cause and a result can be translated as there is no karmas.

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:53.980
 There is no karmas. No virtues and no virtues.

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:57.980
 No karmas. So there is none of those existence.

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:04.980
 That is why on the Dharmakaya level, in the Kadak in the Dokhi terminology,

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:10.980
 in the Kadak two levels, or in the other terminology in the Buddhistic,

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:17.980
 absolute level, there is none of those existence.

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:27.980
 Then on the relative level, existing, everything existing, all existing,

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:34.980
 how they are existing, as medical display, illusions.

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:41.980
 For that reason, great master Kuntimba said in his teaching, he said,

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:53.980
 "Until we dissolve the duality into the Dharmadattu, until that duality,

00:13:53.980 --> 00:14:06.980
 until that, then by the power of duality, duality arising the medical of the interdependent."

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:11.980
 Interdependent, magically dependent.

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:34.980
 Through the power of the power of the duality and arising interdependent.

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:42.980
 Interdependent is what? This is a very famous terminology, all known terminology.

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:50.980
 It sounds like Samudapada, or the Pati Mokcha Samudapada. I think Parithya Samudapada, not Mokcha.

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:53.980
 Parithya Samudapada.

00:14:53.980 --> 00:15:01.980
 In his debate, those great translators in the eighth century translated as Tijen Devarayuma.

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:11.980
 Tijen Devarayuma, I call translated into English, interdependent, interdependently arising.

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:19.980
 Interdependently arising phenomenon.

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:25.980
 That means all these related truths are known as interdependent.

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:30.980
 They arise. What that means, actually?

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:36.980
 These related truths, what we see, all everything, we see all these things.

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:42.980
 But this need cause, this need condition.

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:48.980
 Cause and condition, there's also not just one cause, one condition.

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:56.980
 There's multiple conditions, multiple disorders, multiple disorders.

00:15:56.980 --> 00:16:01.980
 For example, to come to this table, to have this table.

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:12.980
 You imagine, we know how many things are needed to make this table, or to become like this table.

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:15.980
 Then we don't see, we just sit on it heavily.

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:20.980
 This is not just a camp table, like as it is.

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:25.980
 It's supported by so many things. So many things.

00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:33.980
 That's called interconnected. All, that means this table came here, why?

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:40.980
 It means there's no disturbance of stopping things on the basement, until this came.

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:48.980
 There's no preventions. It's all supported, every way, every direction.

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:55.980
 To begin this with a tree. The tree has to have the earth.

00:16:55.980 --> 00:17:01.980
 That has to have water. That has some degree of the moisture, or the warmth.

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:08.980
 That has something, something for this wind movement, growth.

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:13.980
 It's called Buddhism is bought by the wind. It's brain changing.

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:17.980
 And then it has to have space.

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:20.980
 Like openness, space.

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:23.980
 This tree won't grow on the rock, solid.

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:29.980
 Even according to Buddhism, the rock is also a very translucent space.

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:34.980
 But due to the conditions of the certain things of the interdependent, the rock is solid.

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:39.980
 So this comes. And then not just another tree, the wood.

00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:42.980
 Then they have all the efforts they have to do.

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:49.980
 So many, then finally. And all, so this is called interdependent.

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:54.980
 Interdependent connector. Therefore, great massism gives you.

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:59.980
 Until this is all, I'm sorry, by the power of the duality.

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:07.980
 By the power of the duality, it comes like this interconnecting systems.

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:14.980
 As long as duality exists, that long we have the karma.

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:21.980
 We have the karma, as long as we have the duality, that long we have karma.

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:26.980
 Or, otherwise, we have the cold and conditions and the resulting efforts.

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:34.980
 So therefore, in the teaching series, even though it's illusion,

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:42.980
 it's illusion, but always thoughtful, capable with actions.

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:46.980
 And for that reason, again, great master.

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:49.980
 Naruba said in the teaching, so not Naruba.

00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:55.980
 The Lord said, his sishya said, son, as he called to the Lord.

00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:58.980
 The Lord called Naruba, son.

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:02.980
 And there you have the realization of the perfect emptiness.

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:08.980
 Don't stop. Don't stop the accumulation of two merits.

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:11.980
 Until you are working with realization.

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:20.980
 So that means, until you become the Buddha, please make the accumulation of two merits.

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:24.980
 What are two merits? Accumulation of two merits,

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:29.980
 performing all the good deeds to benefit for the other beings.

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:36.980
 And then, Buddha meditating, meditating, and uniting, cooperating together.

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:41.980
 Otherwise, if we follow the way, explaining in the Dukhi teachings,

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:45.980
 or the Pandya Paramanar teachings, no eyes, no palms, no nose,

00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:51.980
 all that, exactly literally take that, then what it becomes?

00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:58.980
 Because it becomes, then we completely lost control of our own identities,

00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:03.980
 our true nature. And the way we could become, then,

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:08.980
 was a person, individualist on the earth.

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:14.980
 And that's what in the meditation he said, you heard the wrong ways, wrong way.

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:18.980
 And that's what we used to, yes, a few days ago we mentioned,

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:23.980
 great artisans said, I mean, don't tell me, his poem of the disciples said,

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:27.980
 well, those of us who said they have realization of emptiness,

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:32.980
 but their kind of emotion is stronger, stronger than a normal, everyday person.

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:37.980
 Why that? And the Gita Master Ati said,

00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:42.980
 because they are keeping the will on the mouth,

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:46.980
 will on the mouth, not in the heart.

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:49.980
 Only kind of technically do really that.

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:54.980
 Then, I mean, it's just completely, it's like a coyote.

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:58.980
 For that reason, great master.

00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:02.980
 Even you have the highest realization,

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:06.980
 as like sky, jokchin, perfect realization of the jokchin.

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:12.980
 God will treat you, but still all the karmas,

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:16.980
 causing the karmas, causing the karmas is resolved.

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:23.980
 Keep that wind so kind and so subtle, so thoughtful to every aspect.

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:26.980
 Impact in the teaching often said,

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:28.980
 even you become the Buddha,

00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:35.980
 in the Gita Master Ati, even you become the Buddha,

00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:41.980
 do not stop the meditually activities.

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:43.980
 Meditually activities.

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:46.980
 Even you don't have any worries,

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:49.980
 I'm not out of pre of the samsara and all that,

00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:55.980
 but should not perform any unwholesome activities, even the Buddha.

00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:58.980
 That tells by Buddha, for example,

00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:03.980
 Buddha Shakyamuni, who is a totally enlightened being,

00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:08.980
 he meditated in a teaching setting.

00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:11.980
 In the afternoon, when he had the lunch completed,

00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:15.980
 he washed his feet because he walking on the dirt,

00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:23.980
 dirt in the streets, get the food with the student.

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:28.980
 Not just ask all, send his arms both and ask to bring food to him.

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:35.980
 No, he walks with, together with all the students.

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:42.980
 He eat as they get, send food, eat, and then he come back.

00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:46.980
 He washed his feet and he meditated in a teaching setting.

00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:49.980
 Apraṇu meditated, even he meditated.

00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:54.980
 In the morning meditated, that's really in a teaching setting.

00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:57.980
 So this is what we actually need.

00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:00.980
 But then, in the absolute level,

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:03.980
 everything is in Dharmakaya status.

00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:06.980
 Oh, great emptiness in the Dharmadatta state.

00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:09.980
 And that state, in that point of view,

00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:14.980
 came here, said, there is no karma,

00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:17.980
 no cause and no resolve.

00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:20.980
 What is really the karma, actually?

00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:22.980
 Karma is.

00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:25.980
 Where that karma is made, where it comes from?

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:27.980
 Of course, you all know.

00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:29.980
 Few of you don't know that.

00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:33.980
 Karma is created by one's own mind.

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:36.980
 Mind is the dual of everything.

00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:39.980
 Mind is the cradle of the samsara.

00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:42.980
 Mind is the cradle of the nirvana.

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:44.980
 Mind is the cradle of the karma.

00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:46.980
 Karma does not come from outside.
