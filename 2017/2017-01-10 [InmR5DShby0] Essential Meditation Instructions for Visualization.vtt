00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.800
 "This starts from the Great Emptiness and from the Great Emptiness arise the Great Compassion.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:14.400
 It has no boundary, no restrictions, the pervasive compassion in every direction.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:21.400
 That is started from your heart and with that from Great Emptiness and Great Compassion,

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:27.400
 you go there, then you become, or each of us becomes, Vajrasattvas.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.400
 So the essence of Vajrasattva is Great Emptiness and Great Compassion, United Truth.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.400
 That is what the relief Vajrasattvas.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.400
 And then also we see this visualization, all the different elements started.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.400
 Where those elements come from? From the Great Compassion, Great Emptiness.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:54.400
 So this element is, all elements are, are wisdom, are compassion.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:00.400
 So that means everything what we see, gross level, is all started from the five elements.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.400
 So it is, this gross level, whatever it is, compassion, it is wisdom.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.400
 Ourself is compassion, ourself is wisdom.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.400
 We visualize that. That is our true nature, exactly as it is.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.400
 Because we needed visualization of meditation, because of duality, interfering,

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.400
 for that reason, which is coming back to our home, sweet home, our reality,

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.400
 we need to have that, that concentration.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.400
 So we meditate, that is what meditate.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.400
 Otherwise, reality, nature is always with us.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.400
 Our is nothing left, as Buddha said, in the teachings.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.400
 All those great Muslims always said that.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.400
 So now we visualize the Vajras in the tiny universe as the pure land of the Vajrasattva,

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.400
 as compassion and wisdom, and all the elements are the compassion and wisdom and emptiness.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.400
 Ourself as the wisdom and compassion and emptiness.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.400
 And then we are going to recite a mantra.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:04.400
 And that is what, in this page 35, we look here, in page 35, the yoga of repetition.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.400
 That is what we are going to visualize in our heart center.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:15.700
 Again as, our body is transcendental, verse to verse, and body of compassion and emptiness, or

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:16.400
 wisdom.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.400
 That is what it is.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.400
 Inside there is also, in our heart center, transcendental, verse to verse, and body of emptiness

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.400
 and compassion, see Vajrasattva, exactly as in the teachings said,

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.400
 in this page 35, the yoga of repetitions.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.400
 That is what, and then, what this, when we are reciting the mantra,

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.400
 the mantra is performing all the beneficial activities.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.400
 But in the page 36 here, see, see.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.400
 Well, spreading the light that makes offering to all the noble ones.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.400
 That means the Buddhas and Bodhis to everyone.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.400
 And gathering their blessings, our blessings of every enlightenment,

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.400
 I invoke and observe to your heart center.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.400
 You become embodiment of that.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.400
 Or each of us become embodiment of that status.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.400
 And then the light again comes from your heart center,

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.400
 or the Vedya center, your heart center.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.400
 And touch it with all the beings here.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.400
 Purify the obscura, all the sentient beings.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:20.400
 Everyone's obscurations, obstacles, trouble, miserable condition, as I listed,

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.400
 and you know, we all know, we all in samsara, we know.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.400
 Everything is clear, we purify everything, really.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.400
 Completely nightmare, situation, whatever everybody is going through.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.400
 Completely wake it up, kind of completely gone.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.400
 And then what they did, also what they did,

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.400
 establish them in the great bliss, one of the emptiness, two natural states.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:46.400
 And then light come back to your heart center, and now it's a circle.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.400
 And then how we're going to recite this mantra here, see, in the teaching.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.400
 Page 36 again, with one point in mind, clear visualization,

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.400
 unshakeable, rigid pride.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.400
 Remember the perfect of the Purit.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.400
 Purit.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.400
 So we are going to try to keep up identity, call it of the meditation,

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.400
 with these three points.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.400
 Three points are the post is.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.400
 The post one, the basic foundation is one point in mind,

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.400
 or trying to maintain the concentration.

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.400
 The post, then with that, post point is clear visualization.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.400
 We can keep the radio, sattva, or as exactly the teachings,

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.400
 that image, as much as we can.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.400
 And then how are we going to keep that up?

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.400
 It says here, unshakeable, rigid pride,

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.400
 not lingering with the intellectual thought and doubt,

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.400
 how this might be, how this and that.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.400
 Those are good when we're not practicing.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.400
 That is that time to do.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.400
 But when you're in the practice, stay with this practice.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.400
 And we like to make the change.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.400
 And we like to get some result.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.400
 That's what really we need to stay with confidence, rigid pride.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.400
 And then, third point is, remember the perfect of the pride.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.400
 Purity is what?

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.400
 Purity is all these gestures, all those different things we make,

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:12.400
 and it's nothing but all is compassion, all is wisdom,

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.400
 all is great emptiness, all is magical display of the illusion of compassion,

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.400
 love and mercy.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.400
 That is what it is, really trying to stay with that.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:26.400
 If we keep these three points, then the result, the achievement

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.400
 comes so easily in the teaching said and all the great masters said.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.400
 So that's why, again, I'm just reminded to you,

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.400
 and now we really practice this one.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.400
 This short Madhya Sattva, short Mantra Vedya Sattva,

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.400
 and long Mantra Vedya Sattva.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:47.400
 Suppose we do this quite wide, the short one, afterward we do the long one.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:53.400
 And then we start the fire in the ceremony again.
