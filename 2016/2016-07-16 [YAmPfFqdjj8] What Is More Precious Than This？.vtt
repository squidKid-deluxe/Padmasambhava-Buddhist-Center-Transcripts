00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 Welcome. This is again one of the very special, joyful, great moments in our lives.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 We have many beautiful times in our lives when we are reflecting to the past.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 But truly, this is standing as one of the very beautiful times.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:27.200
 Because we are going to reflect on the joy and the peace, happiness, how to bring joy and the peace

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.000
 to all living beings, regardless of whatever they are.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.370
 That genuine call of our best upon true love and completion, versitum, is nothing but the most

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:49.030
 precious, the most enriching scholars in our heart and mind that we can explore and enjoy and share

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.000
 that with others.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 We follow in the light of the Dharma Buddha and the teaching of the Buddha, what Buddha taught.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 He said how to bring joy and peace, happiness, to all living beings.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:13.060
 Praying from the violence and the disturbances, and genuine respect and appreciation to all living

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.000
 beings, as for existence.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 When you reflect all those statements and teachings, how beautiful, really.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 It's not just that I am a brackish on the Buddhism talking that. Truly it is so rich, so precious.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:39.210
 If we reflect what is greater than this, we ask the question ourselves, what else is greater than

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.000
 this?

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.670
 Joy and appreciation, kindness, compassion, rest of our courage and commitment, determination,

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.000
 beautiful goal and beautiful wish.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 Wish to every living beings. This truly is so special.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 Therefore, today we are going to reflect this. Not just today, for one week or two weeks.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 We are going to reflect on this beautiful meaning.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 Therefore, it is, in a way, a celebration of our own written scholars.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 Bring out that. We already bought of those beautiful things, beautiful scholars.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 By practicing Dharma, by knowing the teaching of the Buddha, following as in his light.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 We know that. We did this. But today we are going to glorify that.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.530
 We are going to deepening this. And we are going to be more broad understanding of this, how we can

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:35.000
 benefit.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 To our self, to our family, our friends, to all the neighbors, to every living being.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 In the context of love, joy, appreciation, which is known as bodhicitta.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 I miss you whenever you know.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 So therefore, this is one of the really beautiful moments in our life.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.320
 And I am so thankful to all of you for organizing and facilitating and coming and participating in

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.000
 this.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 Truly, we are making some difference in our heart and mind and make a difference to the world.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 In the context of peace, harmony and joy, respect and appreciation.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 That is what I will do. And this is so, therefore, such a beautiful. I thank you all.
