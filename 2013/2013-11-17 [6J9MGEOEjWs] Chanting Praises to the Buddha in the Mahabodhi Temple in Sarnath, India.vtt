NOTE     "description": "On the morning of November 16, 2013 during the annual celebration of the First Turning of the Wheel of Dharma in Deer Park, Sarnath, India, Ven. Khenpo Tsewang Rinpoche led prayers in the Mahabodhi Temple to Buddha Shakyamuni before rare bone relics of the Buddha were unveiled in the temple before thousands of devotees. On this special occasion, Lama Lorraine recalled how when the Khenpo Rinpoches would arrive to Sarnath year-after-year, they would always immediately go to the Mahabodhi Temple as one of the first things they did in Sarnath to offer prayers and katags to this statue of the Buddha.",
