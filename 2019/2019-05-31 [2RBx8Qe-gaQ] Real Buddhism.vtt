00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.750
 Welcome. Thank you very much for coming. Thank you for participating. Thank you everyone. Thank you

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:07.520
 so much. Thank you.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:16.640
 Again, today, we're going to talk about really about this sadhana. Sadhana, and generally,

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:23.680
 this is one of the very important practices of the Vedayana teachings. And as I mentioned, and you

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:24.400
 all know,

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:32.640
 you know, the Vedaya, generally, the Buddha teaching is all connected. There's no introduction.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:41.200
 There's no contradictions. All is connected. Everything follows the same way. From the first time,

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:47.280
 the greatest teacher of all of you, teaching is known as the Four Noble Truths. Anything

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:54.980
 continually, all the basic Buddhist school teachings, Sutra Mahayana teachings, Vedayana Mahayana

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:55.040
 teachings,

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:04.640
 all are lined up. There's nothing, any kind of contradictions. Every teaching is to explore our

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:05.440
 goodness,

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:14.240
 our beautiful nature, nature of our sun, nature of all beings. So that's how all the teachings line

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.200
 up.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.680
 And I want again to explore the teaching. That means the teaching is not just outside of somebody's

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:29.360
 talking to that, alien things to us. Teaching is our goodness. Each of our goodness,

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:37.360
 our traditions, our beauties, beauty of our nature of the mind, beauty of our spirit, beauty of our

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:46.160
 present, beauty of the poem, beauty of the song, beauty of the soft spaces. That is what we explore

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.120
.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:53.520
 When we discover completely this beautifulness, beauty and goodness call it, that state is known

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.680
 as the Buddha word, enlightenment. Is there something that enlightenment is coming from outside?

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:07.920
 Reality level according Buddhism in the teaching said that as well as all the great masters echoed

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:15.600
 throughout the centuries. Though every goodness, every enlightened call it is within us. But we

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:23.360
 mishandled. We mishandled, we missed the point. We've been looking for, looking out all the time

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:30.400
 with expectations. Something had to come from outside. But reality is all here. We have to explore.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.800
 That's what really the teaching always measured. Now to explore the teaching, how are we going to

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.840
 do this?

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:44.480
 This is known as the great master, Ng Cheba, measured in the teaching. Teaching known as

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:52.720
 three noblities or three supreme ones or nobles. And that which three, this noble one is also

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:59.360
 changing partitionology. Our great teacher, he always reminds us one after another that every

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:06.960
 our practice should be put in the frame of these three nobles. Three noble. Then it is perfect. Why

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.960
?

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:14.800
 The beginning is a good noble, middle is a noble, continuity is noble. We know that noble, that

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:15.040
 must

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:24.800
 be noble. Then it looks noble, songs noble, it is noble. So if we like to call it that, that's the

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:30.560
 thing what we should do. These three nobles. So now I'm going to talk this really about that

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:38.080
 frame of the three noble and I'll talk about this Dapini light as sadness and now
