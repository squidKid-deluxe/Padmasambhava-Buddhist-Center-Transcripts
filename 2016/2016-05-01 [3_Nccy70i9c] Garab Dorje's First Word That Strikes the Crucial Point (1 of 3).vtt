00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.650
 Just a little bit of that, he said, these are, in the middle of the samsaktins, these are

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:09.280
 introducing or pointing out teaching of Dzogchen.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.680
 That is what he said, pointing out teaching of the Dzogchen practices.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:20.040
 That is, generally, again in Dzogchen teaching, what is called Dzogchen teaching?

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:26.240
 With instruction teaching can be divided, nor can be, it is known as two great practices.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:32.560
 Two practices and toga practices, two practices, tucku and toga.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:38.160
 Tucku is a very old, which many of you already know, but cutting thoroughly.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:45.780
 Cutting thoroughly, what means cutting thoroughly, all the propagation of the duality, instantly

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.160
 cutting thoroughly,

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.240
 that teaching technique is known as tucku teachings.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:57.240
 And then there is another teaching, Dzogchen teaching, known as toga teachings.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.240
 Lipping over teaching or instantly lipping over teaching.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:09.240
 These two teachings are what are they, generally, they are both the nature of our mind.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:16.240
 The emptiness aspect of our nature of the mind or the dharmakaya nature is explained clearly,

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.240
 beautifully, thoroughly.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:26.240
 That teaching is known as tucku teachings, dharmakaya teaching, dharmakaya nature of the mind.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:33.240
 Dharmakaya nature of the mind is emptiness, unimpeded.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.240
 That nature, we went so many times, you know that, that is.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.240
 And then this nature of the mind has another aspect, clarity aspect.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.240
 Clarity aspect of teaching is known as toga practices.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:55.240
 This toga teaching is the nature of the mind, clarity aspect of the nature of the mind.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.240
 Both are the nature of the mind.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.240
 It is inseparable states.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.240
 This particular teaching, katneh shola, or this teaching what we are going through,

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:13.240
 is teaching on the tucku or teachings on the dharmakaya emptiness nature of the mind.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.240
 We are exploring our nature of the mind.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:25.240
 And here, again, it is the important outer teaching of the dharmakaya tucku teachings.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:32.690
 Now, tucku teaching can be, again, I can bring up that statement, the thought, to make clear, kind

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:33.240
 of clear.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.240
 And there is quite a, maybe, one or a few people, maybe, just quite new.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:44.240
 What tucku teaching? Summarized by many great masters, but one of the very famous renowned one,

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:49.240
 summarized by great master, Garab Dorji.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:55.240
 Garab Dorji's teaching, all tucku teaching, summarized in three words.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:02.600
 That is what we call tsuksam netti, pointing out of three word teachings, or three word teachings

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.240
 of three words.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:11.240
 And first is what? Introducing or pointing out the nature of the mind.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:18.570
 Pointing out, and that is, again, whenever you know it, more rantotte, deeper. More rantotte,

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:19.240
 deeper.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:27.240
 More means what? A little bit, ever used word by word. More means the past, past, our past.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:37.240
 Rantot means, rantot means within its own self, within own self.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.240
 Deepa means introducing or pointing out.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:49.240
 So pointing out one's own past or natural, its own nature, its own status, status.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:57.240
 Once on, once on status. So that means, again, to make comment to you,

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:08.240
 our nature, your natural mind is pointing out to your self, or to our self, to our self.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:15.240
 This nature is not pointing outside to the mountain or the moon or the sun or the star.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:22.240
 It is pointing out to your own nature, our own nature of the mind.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:30.240
 What that nature is known as generally in the Buddha's terminology is nathangatangara.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:39.240
 Buddha nature, that you heard many times, pointing out that Buddha nature, this Buddha nature,

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.240
 pointing out.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.240
 This Buddha nature, you know, is ordinary nature.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.240
 Means it's your, our nature, each of our nature, ordinary.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:05:00.240
 It's been with us, from the, what in the Buddha's teaching is it, from the big and less times.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:06.240
 From the big and less, there is no even times that we can put, from the big and less times.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.240
 Until now, it's right here.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:19.240
 That is pointing out. That is pointing, that is showing us that.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:26.240
 Now, this nature, nature of mind, or this mind has two aspects, and we look at them.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.240
 There is samsara aspect, nirvana aspect.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:38.240
 O is what's called, alaya aspect and dharmakaya aspect.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.240
 This time, what is pointed out is dharmakaya, own nature of the mind.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:50.240
 Not the alaya or in the Zouki teaching, conception.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:59.240
 Not pointing out the conception, pointing out our own, any nature of, of dharmakaya,

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:07.240
 which in other terminology is atagatagarva, Buddha nature, Buddha nature, nature.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.240
 That is what it is.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.240
 How is that dharmakaya nature is?

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:22.240
 What is the difference between the conception and the dharmakaya, alaya and the dharmakaya?

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:29.240
 Dharmakaya is the source of all the enlightenment in pure land, for example.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:36.240
 What is alaya? Alaya is the source of all samsaras.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:43.240
 Alaya is the source of samsara, and dharmakaya is the source of nirvana, a very useful word.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:50.240
 Where these both are, within the mind, there is no difference, difference at all.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:58.240
 What is alaya? Alaya or the subcontinent in the storehouse, it is a very basic source,

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.240
 a very beginning of the dualities, dualities.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:08.240
 That is how it begins, begins the samsara disciplines.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.240
 When we are freed from out of that nature, to where?

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:18.240
 Within that nature, within that space of dharmakaya, when you are freed,

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.240
 that is known as dharmakaya, when you are freed.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.240
 That is the source of all the nirvanas.

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.240
 So this time, what is pointing out?

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:37.130
 Where Garab Durya or Dzokhi Tiji is pointing out as directly to that authentic nature of dharmakaya

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:37.240
,

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:44.240
 which is never diluted by the dualities, cannot be diluted by dualities,

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.240
 cannot and will not and is not.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:51.240
 That nature is pointing out.

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:58.240
 But what is that nature? Dharmakaya nature is the rupa.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:04.240
 Dzokhi Tiji says rupa. What is rupa is?

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:09.240
 First rupa or dharmakaya is the ordinary nature, as I said many times.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:17.240
 And the teaching is the basic foundation or basic, the ordinary nature of the summoner-buddha,

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:21.240
 the Buddha summoner-buddha, your own summoner-buddha.

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:27.240
 We went to the beginning of the Dzokhi Tiji, there is five summoner-buddha can be divided.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:32.240
 The foundation summoner-buddha, part summoner-buddha,

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:38.240
 and result summoner-buddha, and Buddha summoner-buddha inherited summoner-buddha.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:43.240
 Five different summoner-buddha, we went through those things.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:49.240
 This is the basic summoner-buddha of each of us.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:53.240
 We all have this nature, this.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:58.240
 This summoner-buddha is what, how that nature is.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:02.240
 As I said many times, in a minute, I'm a great master.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:13.140
 As I always said, Khadibadi Heron said to you, "Uninvited, transparent, free from all the

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:14.240
 complexities,

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:17.240
 free from all the extremes."

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:26.240
 Think of those words, this is not just wording, it's exploring the deep meaning of our nature.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:33.240
 Each of those words are inexpressible, inconceivable.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:40.240
 That is your nature, that is my nature, that is everyone's nature.

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:44.240
 That is what the Garab Dogi is pointing out.

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:47.240
 Hey, we all have that nature.

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:57.240
 This is, in this level, the Buddha Shakyamuni and our Salah, and the small cockroaches,

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:00.240
 cockroaches has no difference, no difference.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:04.240
 Nature is the same.

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:07.240
 Almost, no difference.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.240
 All is the same.

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:13.240
 Nature, the basic, that's what we'll be trying to preserve, summoner-buddha.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:15.240
 What do you say?

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:20.240
 I and all the sentient beings share the same nature.

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.240
 We enjoin the prayer of Qantasam.

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:26.240
 Same nature, there's no difference.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:29.240
 This is what we have to recognize.

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:37.240
 If we didn't recognize this nature, when we're meditating, then our path will be not recognized.

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.240
 All is diluted.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:41.240
 Our achievement will be diluted too.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:45.240
 So there, number one, here in the teaching, he said here too.

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:52.240
 Here, in this teaching, he said, "It's very important."

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:59.240
 We didn't come here after that, but at the end of this song he said, "This is very important.

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:02.240
 We didn't recognize the world perfectly.

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:05.240
 It looks like mixing up the day one."

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:16.690
 If the day one is mixed up, then here he said, "Then all this will be mixed up under the full moons

00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:17.240
."

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:24.240
 And this is the song that Surya said, "Nomid, nomid person, nomid person."

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:27.240
 Qantas said, "Oh, this today is positive."

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:30.240
 Positive or second is something he said.

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:33.240
 But full moons are shining in the night time.

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:36.240
 Right there, full moon, Swiss full moon.

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:41.240
 But for him, he said, "Today is," he started saying that until moon comes,

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:45.240
 he started saying it is second or third or something.

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.240
 This he said that.

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:50.240
 Because he mixed up the dates, dates mixed up.

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:58.300
 Similarly, like this, if we mix up the will, we will mix up the path and we will mix up the

00:11:58.300 --> 00:11:59.240
 achievement.

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:02.240
 Therefore, will is very important.

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:05.240
 And what is will?

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:07.240
 Again, it's unimpeded.

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:15.240
 Emptiness, openness, vastness, inconceivable, inexpressible, unborn, honest.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:21.240
 How clearly Buddha Shakyamuni said, one after another, this gracious type of teacher said.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:27.640
 As I said before, this is not just a kind of methodology of the story or telling some spiritual

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:28.240
 other side.

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:33.240
 We can experience our own inner intelligent wisdom.

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.240
 Find out it's true or not.

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:36.240
 Right here.

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:40.240
 Put it through the Madhiva teaching and generally the Sutra Buddha teaching.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:44.240
 Kind of looks like you have to immigrate outside to find you have to be very intelligent.

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:47.240
 Kind of all started, told and all this.

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:52.240
 But this time, he's pointing out and struggling to rediscover all that nature,

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:57.240
 all that will be detected right with our heart, right with our mind.

00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:00.240
 Ask us is true or not.

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:03.240
 Nature of mind is inconceivable or not.

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.240
 Ask us.

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:07.240
 Nature of mind is inexpressible.

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:08.240
 Ask us.

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:14.240
 Nature of mind is unborn, unceasing, or beyond unborn, unceasing.

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:15.240
 Ask us.

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:17.240
 It's true or not.

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:20.240
 This is very important.

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:24.240
 Again here, Graham asked, we should build the certainty of wisdom to the view.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:27.240
 Intellect, certainty of wisdom.

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:32.240
 Confidence truly sees itself as it is.

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:39.240
 This wisdom, now this old nature of this garabdodh is one point out of the first one.

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:44.240
 Then it also can be introduced as what?

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.240
 Three verses.

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:50.240
 As I said the other day, sometimes many of you know this.

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:54.240
 It's called the wisdom of the great emptiness.

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:56.240
 Wisdom of the clarity.

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:58.240
 Wisdom is union.

00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.240
 Union.

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:01.240
 What that means?

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:06.240
 When you look to the nature of the mind, when you look to gather our nature of the mind,

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:12.240
 it's the empty, it's the open, it's the vastness as I said so many times.

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:15.240
 That is wisdom.

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.240
 That is the wisdom.

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:20.240
 That is intelligence.

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:22.240
 That is the wisdom.

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:25.240
 So this is called the wisdom of the emptiness.

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:29.240
 Or the wisdom of the emptiness of Dharmakayas.

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:32.240
 Dharmakaya is the wisdom of the emptiness.

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:38.240
 And then there is emptiness, not blame-emptiness, not negation status, not black hole.

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:41.240
 It is fullness, clarity.

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:43.240
 That is the wisdom.

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:47.240
 Clarity is the wisdom which is known as Anzogji teaching.

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:48.240
 What?

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:51.240
 Sambokaya wisdom.

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:54.240
 This is Sambokaya wisdom.

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:59.240
 And then this clarity and emptiness is union.

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:02.240
 There is no separation that we can make difference.

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.240
 That is known as union.

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:08.240
 That is also known as pervasive energy.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:13.240
 Tugyam or the pervasive intelligence of compassion.

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:14.240
 Compassion.

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:15.240
 That is the wisdom.

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:19.240
 So this is the nature of the mind, your nature of the mind,

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:25.240
 my nature of the mind, everyone's nature of the mind is within 3 Gaya status.

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.240
 3 Gaya status.

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:32.240
 3 wisdom status, 3 Gaya status.

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:38.240
 So therefore, this is the original Buddha,

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:41.240
 the original awakened Buddha, Sambokaya.

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:44.240
 We must be recognized.

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:50.240
 We must be happy, joy, to discover this nature.

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:56.240
 We've been wondering in samsara why, because we didn't recognize,

00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:00.240
 we didn't keep up that nature, call it as it is.

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:02.240
 We dilute it.

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:04.240
 Dilute it.

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:09.240
 So that is really a border, first and to do it.

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:12.240
 The point of the morato, the Bhagavat dojis,

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:15.240
 first walk, morato drop.

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:17.240
 It's right here.

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.240
 That is that. Right here.

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:20.240
 Now this...
