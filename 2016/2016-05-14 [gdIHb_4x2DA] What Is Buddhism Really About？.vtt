00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.030
 "In our life, because we are activating and glorifying our innate and beautiful nature. Nothing but

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:19.230
 gender. Beautiful nature of love, kindness, compassion. Bring more joy and happiness to ourself and

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.000
 bring joy and happy peace to all living beings."

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:30.850
 That is wonderful. What else is best in the world than this? Think carefully. It's not just making

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.000
 straight men, the Buddha said, following, all this and that.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.640
 But think carefully. Put what you are teaching. Put the mind in your heart. You are not going to

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.000
 let it. It's true or not.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.360
 What else we are doing? Since we are all mother, we have been together, that's what we are really

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:55.440
 doing. According to our best capabilities, with the devotion and joy and love, that's what we would

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:03.000
 like to bring peace, harmony, happiness to me, to all the living beings.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:12.020
 And I'd like to also remove the hindrance and obstacles. Obstacles, what blocking those which we

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.000
 call, we like to release, remove. That's what we've been discussing. That's what the Buddha taught.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.710
 That's what we are really following as voice of the native masters. This is wonderful. There's

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:30.900
 nothing what else is best in the life, more than that or even beyond the life, according to the

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.000
 Buddha teaching.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:40.950
 So therefore, I always said, brand new peace, brand new. Why we have created darkness in our heart

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.000
 and mind, spoiled time. We've been spoiled our time and now in our lives.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.020
 We carry with the force of the duality, ego and doubt and hesitation and skeptical. That we've been

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.000
 being all the time.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.890
 According to the Buddha teaching, that's been a long time. From this ridiculous time, we carry that

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.000
. We have to say, "Now, enough is enough."

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.110
 We have to use the American word for rhythms. "Enough is enough." That's really, I mean, it's not

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.000
 just American statement or saying these things, truly.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.030
 And we like to be kind and nice and make so meaningful. We like to change in our status, bring the

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.000
 sunshine in our heart. That's what we need.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:32.070
 Bring joy, peace, happiness. And then both each other. That's what love and kindness convey to all

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.000
 living beings.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 Not just a sub-centered mind or eye. That we've been doing for a long time.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.810
 Great Master Chantideva said in his teachings, "We've been doing that sub-centered mind for a sense

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.000
 of vigorous time.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 How much we could go far? How much we achieved? How much we've been successful?"

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.590
 But on the other hand, look at the example of the Buddha. All those great body suppers, all the

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.000
 sentient beings, they're put in front of all the living beings, then themselves.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.500
 And what they don't? They become full of joy, full of love, full of kindness, full of respect,

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.000
 appreciation.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 Don't the earth, don't the ground, not hovering in the sky, this and that, this and that things.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:30.300
 Read their actions, read their legacies, read their life stories. Those are great teachings. That

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.000
 is both each other, love and kindness.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.750
 That also we try to activate ourselves. We bring this. I mean, what else the best and the beautiful

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.000
 thing than that?

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 Again, think that. Think this. And of course, in samsara there are so many this and that thing.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 Those are what's called six pleasures of the six senses.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.600
 Six senses. Truly there is that, those things. But how much they really give the pleasures?

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.000
 Happiness, peace.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.720
 Ask, we've always had those things. I mean, we have all that. This is one of the beautiful richness

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.000
 countries in the world.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:11.310
 We have some degree of those organs. And how much really will bring joy and peace, happiness and

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.000
 kind of feel so good.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:20.920
 And many times we have to rely on the drugs. Not, and now what do we have? And then ended with

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.000
 disasters.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:29.310
 Because they didn't eliminate it, they are in a heart, in a joy, in peace. Bodhicata and joy. That

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.000
 is what the leg of that.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:40.350
 Otherwise, in the samsara level, they have the utmost supreme qualities of the six pleasure object

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.000
ors, of five pleasure objectors.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:50.720
 But yet, they didn't fulfilling quite. We see, we heard in the news, in the television. I'm talking

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.000
 that all the time.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.520
 This, that. So this is something that what we're doing is so big. Therefore again, bring joy and

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.000
 peace.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:08.300
 And it's just joy and happiness as arrogant levels. Joy and peace as humble and simple, simple and

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.000
 with great confidence.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:21.490
 Great sub-contemptments. That is known as in Buddhism or any standard. Meaningful of lives. That is

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.000
 meaningful lives.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:30.020
 To begin with this, then by dhyana teaching. Anybody who learn dokhi teaching. Reality level,

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.000
 everything is enlightened.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 In the three kaya states, only it is spoiled by dualities. Grasping, clinging.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:49.080
 Today we like to remove, release, liberate that duality, bring the way things are in the reality

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.000
 level.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 So therefore, we open the window, we open the like doors to alloy that realization.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 Not just blocked and cobbled by eyes of grasping the duality or thick shield by this. We open that.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 Therefore, we activate everything's purity status. It is not just a making statement again.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 Truly, reality level, it is what it is. So, we like to open that door.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 We don't like to leave that kind of dark corner in the deep of the duality icebox.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 We like to remove. That is all that is known as practicing. Practitioners.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 We are practicing goodness, not practicing of the ego, not practicing of the emotions.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.910
 We are really trying to change lives. We like to make a difference to ourselves. We like to make a

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:51.000
 difference to the other beings.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 That is true practitioners. What is the Buddha's teaching? True practitioners.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:05.610
 Again, we like to practice with humble, simple, don't to the ground. Not just say like, what is the

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:06.000
 great master?

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:14.280
 Not just say like practicing, rainbow, talking, deep service. We like to observe that in heart, let

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.000
 that grow, shine.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 That is what we really practice. So again, we activate all those beautiful qualities.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:31.320
 And that is really what this practice is. And I think there is nothing that is kind of like, one of

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.000
 course, this is the Buddha teaching.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 Buddhism teaching. But what is Buddha's teaching? Have you really think this?

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 We are talking of love. Is this Buddhism? Only Buddhism? We are talking of kindness.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 We are talking about compassion. We are talking about how to remove, release, grasp the dualities.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:59.640
 Is this Buddhism? Nature is not dominated by this, today, that, today. Nature is free, open,

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:01.000
 relaxed.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:07.030
 Only these levels are the dualities. We are fabricated. There is nothing. We are trying to put the

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:08.000
 lasso on the sky.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.000
 That is what the great master Mohanarbuddhi says. We are trying to tie their sky.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 But we cannot tie the sky, except we will tie us. Tied and bold, and it will reverse us.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 Not the sky. This is what we are talking of, generally.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 This, loving kindness, compassion, and joy, and peace, and happiness, respect, and appreciation.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 Remove all the grasping, self-centered mind. This is Buddhism.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 If you think carefully, it is nothing to do with the Buddha's teaching.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 Buddha appointed how the way the nature is. That is what the Buddha said.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:55.530
 "I am the teacher." Buddha said, "I am the teacher. I am teaching. I am sure of the nature as it is

00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:56.000
."

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 That is the greatest teacher the Buddha taught.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 Buddha taught what he taught, and when he stands with that, he stands with what he said.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 Humble, simple, and walking with bare feet, holding the arms above, carrying his own robes,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 robes, and walking in the cities, villages, and picking up the food, along with the guru, students.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 But that didn't act as his big kind of boss or big king.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 Because he was a god, and kindness, and compassion, joy, and appreciation, every living being.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 And the teaching said, what the teaching said, "Buddha loves all living beings as his own child."

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 Truly, this is what the Buddha said. "Love and compassion has no boundaries."

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 That is what it is. So therefore, we are trying to reactivate those beautiful qualities,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:05.000
 and that will make meaning for our lives. That means we will be happy, peaceful, joy in this life.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
 We will leave this world with joy and peace for happy,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:15.120
 and we'll leave good legacy and example to our family members, our friends, the neighbor whom we

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.000
 associated.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 That is known as meaningful lives. Truly, not with meaningful lives, making good things.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 So, with those understanding, activate all those beautiful qualities,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:39.000
 and now you will be moved to the teaching of the great Master Kyaopara in Song 10.
