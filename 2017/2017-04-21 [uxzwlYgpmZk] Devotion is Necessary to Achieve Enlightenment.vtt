00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.230
 "Fine and what? Relatation came, banging to his face, by filth. Greeting, looks like choking. It's

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:17.410
 kind of funny. Relatation came by knocking, if I use more and more, knocking on his head and fold

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.600
 down in one-third cup.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:28.260
 That is, according to Dzogtin, according to order, pointed out teaching, directly pointed out,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.600
 exactly as it is, bouncing, this.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:38.500
 And then, for example, in the teaching said, when Guru Padmasambha came, this pointed out, and so

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.600
 Guru Padmasambha said that terminology came from there.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:57.480
 And in the teaching said, Guru Padmasambha, there's one old woman, I mean, that's what Khyentse

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.590
 said, an old woman who was so devoted to Guru Padmasambha, she offered many times, always, I mean,

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.600
 she comes, she brings yoga to Guru Padmasambha, she offered to Guru Padmasambha.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.850
 And that being, many times, she had strong devotion to Guru Padmasambha. She didn't receive any

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.600
 other teachings or anything, just she loved so much, she liked and she felt so devoted to it.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:34.290
 And she trusted, trusted, and offering the yogurts. And then she heard, Guru Padmasambha is leaving

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.600
 from Tibet, so she thought, kind of feel bad, and she bought some yogurts.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.460
 And she asked, please, for this, there's such a great master, I should ask some teachers, so please

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.600
 give me some teachers, please give me some teachers.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:54.480
 When she said that, Guru Padmasambha pointed out his index finger, who are you, who you are, who

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.600
 are you?

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:06.570
 When Guru Padmasambha said that, that moment, it dawns in her heart, moment, who I am, that thought

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:13.320
, kind of things, she didn't, kind of immediately say why he's asking that, he didn't, he didn't say

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:19.160
 that, but she thought, who I am, she kind of thought that, that moment, she got part of the

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.600
 realization of the true nature, exactly.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:31.290
 So that is, who are you? That was the pointing of the teaching to this old woman. That walked her,

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.600
 poor her, rich enlightenment.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:41.470
 Really, that's the, because of her loyalty, devotion, and trust between Guru Padmasambha and

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.600
 unparalleled. That's what got the realization.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:52.450
 So realization is not something that comes always a fancy way, this and that way, but as long as

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:58.600
 you have the devotion and trust, confidence, loyalty, that, the realization dawns.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:06.240
 For example, also in the teaching, said, said, said that, this like, what's called, there's a

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:12.630
 famous pauper, grand master pauper, who is foremost a disciple, oh, one of the pauper master, not

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:19.600
 say, former, wonderful, both disciple, was a nyushar, nyungto, nyungto, nyungto.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:28.600
 And he was a teacher, so he was a disciple of a nyukar, sorry, a pauper, nyungto.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:35.830
 And nyukar, nyungto, stayed with the pauper, nyungto, I think over 20 years, or maybe close to 30s,

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.600
 and resume in teaching, practicing.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.470
 In the teaching said, the life story said that, that's what written by famous master, that, that k

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:47.600
impo makchung, kimpo makchung.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:55.590
 And kimpo makchung is one of the really great master, famous master, he, his, he always recognized

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.600
 him as emanation of bhmana, bhmana matters.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:04.720
 Because of, in the teaching said, bhmana matter before his departure from Tibet, I will be coming

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:11.260
 back to every hundred years to re-correct these object teachings, or re-strengthening the correct

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.600
 these object teachings.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:19.600
 So as he promised that, and there's a lot of like emanation, they called one after another.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:27.600
 So many people, many great masters, you see, this kimpo makchung, kimpo makchung or kimpo makchung.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.600
 Was really reincarnation of bhmana matters, bhmana matters.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:39.510
 And who was also, root teacher of the great master or jabji, jadar makchung, his oldest jadar makch

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:40.600
ung, kimpo makchung.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:49.690
 So kimpo, this yukilungto was a grand master of jadar makchung, if I say, grand, grand teacher of

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.600
 the jadar makchung, jadar makchung.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:00.600
 So one time, what is it? So I think this yukilungto is really one of the great masters to himself.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:06.860
 But I think he thought, I think maybe he must be telling to Padronamaji, I didn't recognize the

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.600
 nature of the mind still.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.600
 I think he must have said many times.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:20.510
 So one time, great master Padronamaji is, okay, he lay down in the night time, night time and do

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:25.600
 the sky meditation, in the night time, night time.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.600
 And then Master, so Padronamaji is doing this.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.600
 And then Padronamaji called to yukilungto.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:41.600
 Yukilungto, you always say, said you don't recognize your nature of my mind.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.600
 Come here, do as I do in meditation.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:52.610
 Lay down, lay down on the floor or on the ground, not floor, outside on the ground and look to the

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:54.600
 sky and look to your mind.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:06:01.600
 And so Master, that yukilungto did, I mean he said he did, he did.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:09.010
 Well, they lie down and Padronamaji starts talking, can you see the stars, can you see all the

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:10.600
 stars or the moons?

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.600
 Can you see those? Of course he sees them.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:19.600
 And then he starts saying, can you hear the dark noise at the Dokki monostraps?

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.600
 Dark noise at the Dokki monostraps.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:33.600
 When he heard that word and really he got the perfect understanding of the mind, when he heard that

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:41.600
, can you hear the dark noise of the Dokki monostraps?

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:51.600
 That immediately rang him of the realization of the true nature of the mind, exactly as it is.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:56.600
 So therefore, again, we have the devotion, it really is brains.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:02.600
 Realization is something so surprising, beautiful, perfectly.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:10.600
 And then Master Bhagavatam Sahib in the teaching said that also I heard from Kachin of Dokki.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:19.850
 And when he was young, he wanted to see the reincarnation of the Jigmeenubha, Dokki and Gunga,

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:20.600
 reincarnation of Jigmeenubha.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:31.680
 So we went to Bhagavatam, when he was young, and maybe in the 20s, to see this reincarnation of Jig

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:32.600
meenubha.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:39.600
 And so he saw Jigmeenubha reincarnation, Jigmeenubha reincarnation is very famous as crazy yogi,

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:40.600
 crazy yogi.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:47.600
 He said, "Dokki and Gunga, Jigmeenubha." Wild, wild chances.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:53.600
 So when he came, we came to him and asked some teachings.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:08:01.600
 That immediately he got up and hold, hold his collars, collars.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:10.670
 And knock it down, knock it down, or he turn over and push it down on the field and said, "You old

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:13.600
 dog. You old dog."

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:22.600
 Here, eco-williant in this country, he picked up and knocked to the ground and said, "Bullshit.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:22.600
 Bullshit."

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:28.920
 That's it. I mean, it's a bit old dog when you say, "That is eco-williant up here. Bullshit. Bull

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:29.600
shit."

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:34.600
 So you push it down or throw him on the ground with that.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.600
 He feel unconscious in the teachings.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:45.220
 The moment he will do it, out of that unconsciousness, he really see the perfect meaning of the

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:47.600
 great nature of the emptiness.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:57.480
 So ever since, part of the Ramaji used that word, "old dog," as his nicknames, when you read books

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:57.600
 of his teachings,

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:08.600
 "I old dog wrote this." He treat that as a secret name, secret holy name, and the God realizes it.

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:10.600
 So this is the what-how.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:16.730
 When you have the devotion, when you have the joy and the appreciation, the relaxation comes so

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:18.600
 beautifully, so nice.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:28.060
 Also, there is another story in the teaching set. I mean, it's not just stories, really true

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:28.600
 stories.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:36.220
 Not so far from my country, my birthplace, sorry, my birthplace, there is an area called the dapp

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:36.600
les.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:42.600
 There is one old lady, old lady who don't really know dharma too much.

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:48.600
 But she had some devotion to Jainese and Thara.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:53.600
 She practiced Jainese and Thara all the time.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:59.600
 She finished many millions and hundreds, many millions of the mantras of Jainese,

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:06.600
 and many over 100,000 of the prayers of the 21 Tharas she preached.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:16.200
 At her end, she don't know dharma or anything except that she has a strong devotion to the Jainese

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.600
 and to Thara.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:23.600
 And in the teaching set, she had a dream almost every night.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:32.600
 One blue lady comes, she gives always some clothes to her, always in the dream.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:46.080
 In one year, white man with top hair comes in the dream, always giving her as Christa manas, she

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:46.600
 dream.

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:54.600
 Because of her devotion, blessings of Thara and Jainese really came.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:11:01.290
 Even though she don't know any other dharma, any kind of all the intellectuals, anything, but

00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:01.600
 devotion.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:06.600
 That had unfailing devotion for this realization.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:11.600
 And therefore, it's not just only that, but yoga and practice.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:16.600
 Any practice is so important to have the devotions.

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:20.600
 Devotions. So that is my brilliant talk for today.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:24.600
 And if you have some questions, please ask me.
