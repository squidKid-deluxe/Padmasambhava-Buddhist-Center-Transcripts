00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.120
 Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome. Again, thank you everyone for coming,

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:14.720
 and for participating, and again we continue to follow these retreat practices. We're doing this

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:21.600
 for a while, and so thank you very much for all these opportunities and all this retargeting

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:29.440
 and discussing the teachings of the Buddha Dharma, and the allegory of Master's according to my

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:36.880
 capabilities, so we discuss it as much as we can explore. Thank you. Thank you very much again.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:45.680
 Again, as we continue in the teachings of the Jyapthi Dhruyubuji, and as

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:56.080
 we are dividing into three groups, and which is the first novel, second novel, and third novels.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:03.040
 Among the three novels, the first novel is the intention and the beautiful motivation,

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:11.920
 that is the first novel, and the second novel is then the non-grasping, non-clinging,

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:18.880
 oh no, not mundane attitude, where we're practicing, the personal part of the practices,

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:25.120
 and the concluding part is the dedication and aspirations. Those are the kind of layout,

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:32.160
 and perfect frame, and follow the footsteps of the lineage masters. So today, now again,

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.760
 we're going to talk about the middle part of that principle of our practices. But don't you do that

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.760
?

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.960
 Again, the same thing, we're going to re-stand here. I will be doing motivation, or correct

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:51.600
 motivation. Motivation of the joy and appreciation, and vastness, motivation of the bodhijata,

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.600
 and this I'm going to reflect the teaching, and I'm going to observe the teaching,

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:02.960
 truly made the benefit for all living beings. Remove their suffering, their difficulties,

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:09.200
 whatever they're going through, or remove their suffering through, and also the same term,

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:16.000
 cause of suffering through, we dispel everything, really truly, sincerely, we think from the heart,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:25.040
 heart, and then we reflect our godly teachings. Now, in that teaching, as we talk, we put,

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:32.880
 as we bodhijata, bodhijata is like true bodhijata. We think bodhijata, and actualizing bodhijata,

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:41.360
 and wishing bodhijata is the foundation, that is foundation, that is nature. Nature of the

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:49.120
 bodhijata is love and kindness, compassion, and wisdom, that is. Now, when you have that attitude,

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:56.000
 or that understanding, kind of siddly in our heart and mind, and then we also explain that,

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:03.600
 we do four different ways, as in the teaching mentioned. Four, boneless. There is no borders,

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:11.600
 love and compassion, to all the living beings, free from the border. Those we discuss, and those

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:18.400
 are the four, boneless. Once we have the really good four, boneless, that, or maybe same time too,

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:28.160
 then doni practices. Those equalizing, as well as doning, dahi jiva, in a debate, dahi jiva,

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:36.080
 enabdawi, yinji, those are. Others are more dear than one's own self. So, those really kind of

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:44.560
 mentally practicing, mentally meditating, that with instructions, as much as you get. That,

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:50.720
 again, of course, is compassion. Love and kindness. Love and kindness is compassion,

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:58.000
 and that is really practiced with exercise, or practice of the dungli, practice of those three

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.840
 words. So, those are what the teaching said, as wishing bodhijathas. Once we do have the wishing

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:12.720
 bodhijathas, now we have the actualizing bodhijathas. And of course, when generally bodhijathas, to

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.880
 have

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:18.160
 bodhijathas, you should check the vows of bodhijathas. It is very important. It is a

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:25.760
 lineage of blessings, that reactivating our lineage of the line of the blessings, line

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:31.120
 of the loving kindness and compassion. That continually. And this is, of course,

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.880
 started from the Buddha chapter, Muni. And then, as well as it came from India,

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:43.680
 to Tibet, it really came, but reality is traced back to the Buddha, the great city of Buddha

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:52.560
 Shakyamuni. So, we are connected to that gene, that line, which is the lineage. This lineage is

00:04:52.560 --> 00:05:00.640
 loving kindness lineage, compassion lineage, wisdom lineage. And therefore, it is so powerful,

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:09.360
 so special, so beautiful. And so, tentara bodhijathava. Or you check the bodhijathava,

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:16.080
 of course, rafudu vowels in bodhijathas first, and then bodhijathava. That, when we see today,

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:22.320
 and then we see bodhijatha practices, and now actualizing bodhijathas. Actualizing bodhijathas

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:28.800
 is the principle part of the practices. That, now, we are going to practice until we reach the

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:35.360
 enlightenment. Until we become the Buddha, we're going to practice this, this. And that is now

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.480
 principle part of practice. Principle part of practice is also not something that, oh, principle

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:48.080
 part of practice, then that's it. It's not. This three, what we put, this three from beginner noble

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.080
,

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:55.520
 middle noble, and the conqueror noble, all is connected. All is connected. It contains all of

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.880
 those anyway, too. It's not something completely kind of different from right and left, and all

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:06.400
 that things. All connected. Even when we are doing the principle part of the practices, we should

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:13.280
 activate the occasion with a good motivation. Joy and appreciation. Oh, even for a few seconds,

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:20.720
 or maybe one minute, bring more joy and appreciation. Appreciation, make great thoughts.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:27.600
 And then also love and compassion for all the living beings, and then continue practices.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:34.320
 The principle part of the practice, whatever your practice is. So that is six paramata practices.

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:41.920
 Six paramata practices, again, is not just six paramata, are six different groups in a different

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:49.760
 kind of, on a department. Even one paramata contains all the six parametas. And therefore,

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:57.600
 in the teaching said, all six paramata can be divided into 36 paramata practices because each

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:07.280
 contains six of those. Six of the generosity, six of the morality, six of the bacon, six of

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:15.520
 the joyful effort, six of concentration, six of the Pandya paramata, all the wisdoms. All that

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:22.080
 contains. But it's so powerful, it's so strong, it's a deepening of our practices when we move,

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:29.600
 when we advance in this. This is so powerful, attached to the goal of our own true nature,

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:38.240
 and expressing of the beauty, beauty and its power, power of the body, there are 36 tools,

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:46.160
 six paramatas that lead us to the other show, or get great enlightenment, not just only us,

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:52.080
 but it will help to bring others to get enlightenment. That's what the religious teaching

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:59.440
 of the, of the bodhisattva yanas. So now, when we talk this again, go a little bit details of this

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:08.160
 six paramatas. Six paramatas are, the first is, of course, you all know, and we all heard of this,

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:18.240
 first is the generous paramatas, and the second is morality paramatas, and the third is patient

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:28.720
 paramatas, and the fourth is joyful effort paramatas, and the fifth is concentration paramatas,

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:37.840
 and the sixth is parindya paramatas, so those are the six paramatas. If we translate that into

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:44.320
 English, then of course, I mean, you all know that, but generosity, transcendental practices,

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:53.280
 morality, transcendental practices. So, paramata or Sanskrit goal in English, I think so,

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:59.760
 translated as transcendental, transcendental, and of course, you can take that, you can take up

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:07.280
 is how that translated is now. Paramatas is very popular, six paramata is very popular,

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:14.400
 famous teaching of the Mahayana Buddhism, and it's everywhere, I think it's like, in the book,

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:21.280
 in the cyber highways, and everywhere, you can take that. It's paramata, as what I'm saying,

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:27.680
 is correct or not, transcendental practices. So, now the fourth is the generosity practice.

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:31.920
 Now, each of those, I've got a little bit of details on these

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:39.680
 subjects, and fourth is generosity, and it's lastly, it's called dana, dana,

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:47.280
 and what is nature of the generosity? Nature of generosity is giving,

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:58.560
 giving, that's it, giving or giving way, that is it, dana. How are we giving this time?

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:05.440
 Our giving is now best upon compassion, in other words, it's best upon both each other,

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:15.760
 it's best upon both each other. So, therefore, when we give, we're going to give without any

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:27.520
 expectations, expectations on this life or next life. All kind of good karmas, such as in Buddhism,

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:35.520
 always talks, good karmas, we're going to give without any expectation of the karmas or the

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:45.520
 result in this lifetime and the next lifetime. And what that actually means, in the teaching I said

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:45.520
,

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:54.800
 you give that attitude, it didn't mean you won't get any result. It is going to increase our

00:10:54.800 --> 00:11:03.920
 married duties. It will glorify our observations, truly, but we started clinging on that. Then we

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:12.960
 deluded. We deluded in this power, every suppose a thousand times power, we started clinging,

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:22.240
 it shrank to maybe only 20 or 30 times, 30, compared with a thousand times and 20 times.

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:31.440
 Then it's a big difference. So, therefore, we should not be deluded by the ego clings,

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:40.080
 and grasping and a ratchet, clinging on that. Therefore, it is known as, pretty from the

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:51.120
 expectations, it's this time or next lifetime. And so, that is what is the nature of the generosity

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:51.120
.

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:59.840
 The nature of the generosity is again giving, giving with compassion, giving with body jettiness.

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:10.320
 Now, in the teaching said, the great master of material, or asunder, the teaching said,

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:19.760
 each of those parameters, when we do, it has four benefits, four benefits. The first,

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:29.840
 when we do the generosity practices, it will dispel the hindrance of generosity.

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:39.520
 It will despair or remove what is hindrance or opposite of the generosity,

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:55.840
 opposite of the giving, on the other one. One is opposite of the giving, stingy, omisering.

00:12:55.840 --> 00:13:06.640
 So, the moment you open and give, give, if you truly give as without any expectations,

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:16.160
 then it is horrifying, the strangeness. Strangeness is, what in the teaching said,

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:24.350
 strange is, of course, is a negative emotion. Even you have our grasping, clinging and to hold.

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:25.040
 Hold,

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:32.480
 have you told too much? What in the teaching said, too much misering will lead our world in the

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:32.960
 lower

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:40.800
 realm, such as hunger, gall steps in the teaching said. It will really lead. Even if you rebound

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:50.560
 back to the human whole, we will be very poor. The stranger has no good qualities, no benefits.

00:13:50.560 --> 00:14:01.040
 So, therefore, it will immediately avert or it will put a fire or remove the problems of the

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:09.440
 strangeness. So, that is the first quality of the generosity of these Dhanapara mothers.

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:17.920
 They put a fire in the strangeness. And when you put a fire in the strangeness, what comes?

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:25.440
 In the teaching, actually, it will bring more content to them, more joy, more rich feeling.

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:34.560
 It's not going to change the luxuries of that. When you give, it comes naturally. It doesn't look

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:42.240
 cause or affect us. It brings more mentality of the prosperity,

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:52.720
 contentment and abundance that attitude will come. So, therefore, generosity is very important.

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:58.880
 When you give the generous of that called Bodhicitta or Mahayana, the second quality,

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:07.120
 benefit of the Bodhicitta, sorry, Dhanaparamata, is it will bring realization of the non-conception

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:07.120
.

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:13.920
 Most of us. It will bring the realization of non-conceptions. What in the teaching said,

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:19.760
 when you give the gift of the without any expectation, expectations and one kind of

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:26.720
 expectation, expecting of the subject, expecting on the object, expecting on the action or grasping

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:37.760
 on the subject, grasping on the object, grasping on the subject and action. Or grasping on the

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:45.200
 giver, grasping on the word that you're giving the gift and grasping to the others. Others.

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:52.720
 If you have the grasping, clinging, then that is grasping. But without that, if you give the gift,

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:59.920
 that gift is known as the real gift, free from the, in the teaching said, Khorsom,

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:08.960
 Moomi, in the Tibetan word, which means free from the three spheres, or within the three spheres,

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:16.800
 you keep everything is open. Everything is pure. It's completely 100% pure. It's more than

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:25.520
 unconditional gift. Gift is just so pure. So therefore, it was an active area of the realization

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:32.320
 of the understanding of the great emptiness, realization of the great influence. So that is

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:40.160
 the principle part of the benefits. Our all gift, all paramata should be these states,

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:47.200
 these states, free from the three spheres, free from the subject, free from the object,

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:54.640
 free from the act, that action or the what we're doing, then really become the perfect paramata

00:16:54.640 --> 00:17:02.080
 in each of the trees. So that's what I will now be talking, the dana paramata, a generous paramata.

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:09.440
 So that is the second. Third paramata, third benefit of this paramata in the teaching is the

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:16.400
 benefit of this generosity. It will fulfill the wishes. When you give the gift, it will

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:23.920
 fulfill the wishes, wishes of others and wishes of one's own self. It will fulfill the wish.

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:34.000
 If you fulfill the gift, you also as bodhisattva, you fulfill the wish because you are fulfilling

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.760
 the bodhijata activities. You're accumulating the readiness. We're purifying the observations.

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:48.000
 We did one tool to benefit from other beings. How wonderful. We believe it, we promise to benefit

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:56.080
 and help to all the sentient beings. Now, actually performing. Performing. So, it is

00:17:56.080 --> 00:18:03.520
 fulfilling one's own wish. Also, it is a fulfilling wish for others. What they desire, what they're

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:11.200
 thinking, what do they want. You give some of those, some of the satisfaction in joys.

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:19.760
 Therefore, fulfilling the wish for others. That is the third benefit of the

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:28.000
 generosity. And the fourth one in the teaching says, the fourth benefit of generosity

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:36.080
 is then it will, when you give the generosity with those with attitude, with manner, and exactly

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:36.080
 that

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:43.680
 what we're discussing, explain in that way, it will lead those individually according to their

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:51.520
 capabilities. Or they are connected, connected to the stage of the practices. It will lead.

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:58.320
 And that means what? Again, it means it will lead according there, a karmic connection,

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:04.960
 if I use a simple word, karmic connection of whatever they are. For example, according Buddhism,

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:13.200
 there are three yanas, the Sharaka yana, Pathik Bodhayana, and Bodhisattva yana. So, it will

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:21.920
 connect to them, to those whichever they are interested. That with your gift, your gift manner,

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:29.120
 beautiful kind of manner, you give the gift, gift and share those. And it will connect,

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:40.080
 it will inspire them to connect to the according designated yanas, Sharaka yana, Pathik Bodhayana,

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:51.200
 and Bodhisattva yanas. Those are the whole benefits of the generosity. And each of those six

00:19:51.200 --> 00:20:00.080
 parabhadas are almost the same, slightly different. But otherwise, everyone is the same way. It

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:01.440
 brings

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:09.200
 a good result. So that means when you give the gifts, it brings a good result, like happy to them,

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:15.600
 and also like happy yourself. It will provide our strange attitude of grasping, clinging,

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:22.640
 at least losing our strangeness, and it's opening at the same time. Then every gift,

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:28.640
 those gifts without any grasping, then it really becomes more powerful. And also it will connect

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:37.600
 to those are today according designated yanas, yanas. So therefore, it is very powerful tool

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:44.960
 of the Bodhisattva, actualizing Bodhisattva. That's how we begin Bodhisattva practices.

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:52.000
 Now, as you all know, I'm sure you all don't have heard that, now this generosity can be

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:59.840
 divided into three, three generositys. And each of those has that benefit, what I'm saying then,

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:08.800
 that poor benefit or poor debt. Each of those has, those four, three generositys are known as then,

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:26.240
 and those are material generositys, and teaching generositys, and protection generositys,

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:35.680
 protection generositys. So those are three generositys. And each of those, as I said,

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:45.280
 you all have that poor benefit. Poor benefit, as I mentioned just right now, it all has that.

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:53.360
 First is material generosity. Material generosity, yes, also divided into three.

00:21:53.360 --> 00:22:04.910
 Material generosity, and very big material generosity, very big material generosity. Those are the

00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:05.120
 three

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:13.840
 material generositys. Why is it divided that three way? Because again, when we give the generositys

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:13.840
,

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:21.520
 when we do that generosity, what we call this material generosity, you follow according your

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:28.480
 capabilities. Your capabilities of your wealth, or capabilities of your willingness.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:37.280
 We're not going against that, but we're going to expand our courage and commitment.

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:45.840
 Courage and commitment is not permanent. We can increase, we can develop, we can worsen that,

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:52.720
 worsen that. But if our courage and commitment, willingness, even you have the material,

00:22:53.600 --> 00:23:03.600
 inability to say you should not do all. Follow your heart, what in a simple word, follow your

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:11.920
 heart what you can do. But do that with joy, do that with appreciation, do that with politeness,

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:20.000
 do that without, do that without any expectations. It's open gift, open hearted,

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:31.040
 hearted. So even what Shanti there was teaching, and guide to the way in the lives of Modi Satva,

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:38.880
 what the teaching said. Those very tight, steady persons can give from one hand to the other and

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:45.120
 close the eye and thinking I'm giving this to the other person and going vulnerable. So train

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:54.240
 ourself, gradually. And what Yogi, even the teaching said, the water tables, waters, walls kind of

00:23:54.240 --> 00:24:02.800
 exchanging back and forth from between two hands and arms. Those, even those are teaching taught.

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:12.720
 So let me explain the gradually, not forceful. But whatever that, do with joy, do with open heart,

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:19.520
 do with loving kindness and compassion of both each other, both each other. Learn. Then each

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:26.560
 time when you're able to do that, you should reduce yourself, not the arrogance. Feel happy

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:33.600
 I did something good. May I be able to do more even in the future. May the benefit of all living

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:43.040
 beings always have the inspirations, aspirations, which will open the heart, open the capabilities,

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:52.080
 open big result according to the teaching. Be practical. Be practical. So the material

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:59.120
 generousness or the generally material generousness. And the big material generousness, then you

00:24:59.120 --> 00:24:59.920
 can read

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:06.080
 in the Buddha's teachings. Or maybe also in a minute those beings really can give. So many things,

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:12.560
 big buttons, teachings, they give to the material they're giving. Very much they're giving to all

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:18.160
 their, even their buildings, house, and appropriate and all those things. They're giving for the

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:18.480
 good

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:23.680
 cause and good reasons to help us with all the beings or remove their suffering and difficulty

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:30.800
 while it is all that. Those are known as big gifts. Then I think big gifts in the Buddha teaching

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:38.320
 mentioned, because I think you mentioned in many times the Buddha even his own life to to protect

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:43.520
 others, such as like tigerism. I should show you all. This is the one where we know the

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:50.880
 life stories. Once upon a time Buddha was born as like prince, prince, and three brothers, and

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:51.200
 three

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:57.840
 brothers, and the same parent. They're all the brothers, they're all good friends, and they

00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:08.000
 explore the jungles. They went on the roofs, explorers, kind of went from the poorest to poorest.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:14.320
 They just explored that. They're all kind of looking at them. On the road they saw one of those

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:14.880
 areas,

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:26.400
 so mother, tigers, mother gave birth of the six cows, cows, and she's so hungry. There is no food,

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:32.720
 she didn't get food, anything, and she's almost dying, and other cows are also almost dying.

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:42.240
 And so, I mean, long story to make sure, and finally, so then they went again,

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:47.840
 went and different explored them, all three brothers went, and suddenly the third brother,

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:54.240
 youngest brother, said, "I'm sorry, I just have to go back a short time. I will join you." He just

00:26:54.240 --> 00:27:01.200
 go away here, something. He said he returned back, same spot, spot where the tigers and

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:08.720
 cops are there, and then he he did the spiritual prayers made through this, my journalistic

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:15.840
 generosity, as we are, I think sometimes we jive, made at this, made by this generosity, said,

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:22.880
 "Liberate all the ways which is not liberated by the Asian Buddha, but this generosity made

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:31.920
 liberated." I think that's the role he said, and he laid down right in front of the tigers,

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:40.560
 tigers, and she's so weak, she couldn't do anything. Even he's pulling right in front of

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:47.200
 them, and then he told what to do, and he got up and got the bumble stick, bumble stick, he pushed

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:54.880
 his, his nerve, his nerve, nerve, and blood came and laid on. Then she started eating,

00:27:54.880 --> 00:28:01.430
 drinking blood, licking blood, and gradually, and then he, I mean this is very dramatic kind of

00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:01.840
 like

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:07.680
 story, story, many times even we don't want to hear these kind of things by kind of our

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:15.040
 timid attitude and ego clings, but that is truly the Buddha gave his own lives. This is not just

00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:22.720
 one kind, there are so many stories in the attack tells, Buddha gave his own life to save the other

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:29.520
 beings, other beings, and that is again another story, and this is what in the teaching said,

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:37.840
 this is the dungli, the ultimate dungli, you're giving your own body to bring the peace and

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:44.880
 happiness to the others, the exchanging dungli. Another one, I think I said, and I'm sure you know,

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:52.080
 know that, and Buddha was born once this time, once upon a time, Buddha was born as

00:28:52.080 --> 00:29:00.320
 turtle, sea turtle, big sea turtle, and then again that many people in the ocean, they all

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:06.080
 kind of cross you by the iPhone or the Cyclone, Cyclone or tornadoes, whatever, and completely

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:14.160
 whole hurricane destroyed, and so that moment this turtle, sea turtle, gigantic sea turtle,

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:21.920
 come up and he indicated, come to me, come to me, and then they made, they started holding to him,

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:28.240
 holding to him, so all those peoples are, who's in the ocean, that group, and hold

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:36.640
 held the sea turtle, sea turtle, and sea turtle, like courageously with his full stand, stand,

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:43.600
 pulled them to the other shores, other shores, and when they raked at their death, and the sea

00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:44.000
 turtle

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:51.680
 feels so happy, I fulfilled my goal, he really feels so happy, but he's so exhausted, so so tired,

00:29:51.680 --> 00:30:00.960
 he falls asleep right at the shore, shore, before going to the ocean, and they were early sleeping,

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:06.960
 they spoke, so much pain came, so much kind of a burning pain is coming, what is that, he woke up,

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:14.640
 immediately woke up, and he looked, in the teaching city, he told them, the ancestors are biting

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:14.880
 him,

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:21.040
 biting him, he told immediately, he's going to jump to the, to the ocean,

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:29.040
 but then he told, oh, I saved those peoples, few peoples to compare with this, this number,

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:39.200
 I saved a man, and now I kill all of this, that is not the smart one, smart way, so I'm going to

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:50.720
 give this body to them, give them, and then he just let them use the whole his bodies, sea turtle,

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:56.640
 time, this is one of the again, shorter or the pomo lives of the buddha chakra members,

00:30:56.640 --> 00:31:03.680
 this is ultimate only practices, in the buddha teaching, generally they say, the only practice,

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:09.280
 the ultimate only practice that you can do, only maybe when you reach the possible boom,

00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:17.520
 second boom, until that, we can do mentally, mentally those only practices, according to our

00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:22.880
 cover minutes, so that is just a generally content, but now again, we go back to this

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:29.760
 generous practice, a generous force is a materials, I divide it, there's three

00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:36.560
 material generalists, and that is kind of roughly now, you understood, and all those things,

00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:42.320
 and there's of course, you all know that, and I'm reminding in a way, reminding each other of what

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:49.280
 teaching says, what we learned from other great masters, or in the books too, so I'm talking that

00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:56.400
 we're activating that, the first is material generalists, second is

00:31:56.400 --> 00:32:07.440
 and the teaching generalists, the holy teachings, generalists, that holy teaching,

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:15.440
 generalists, or the buddha dharma, so dharma teachings, whatever you can share those people in,

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:23.280
 those people who are interested on that, and according their readiness, whatever you can share,

00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:31.440
 and whatever your cover minutes, share that, and always in the teaching said, start with basic

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:39.600
 things, basic, now I don't have to cover that, sophisticated or more complicated, that, that

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:46.720
 even you know, follow the simple basic things, such as ten virtues,

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:57.680
 activating the ten virtues, awarding ten non virtues, relaxed mind, mindfulness, both each other,

00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:05.840
 loving kindness, compassion, this is all universally recognized, immediately can connect those,

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:13.840
 those is very spacious, so what you, those are the teaching, and then teachings of the old other

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:20.800
 teachings, such as nayana teachings too, according your cover minutes, according your knowledge,

00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:30.640
 again when you do these teachings, really non-expectations, no grasping, or no at worldly

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:38.730
 concern, you all know those, at worldly concerns, no expectations, not kind of any kind of

00:33:38.730 --> 00:33:39.600
 reputation,

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:45.510
 bragging, this and that, or not what they say, kind of boosting, bolstering, or kind of like

00:33:45.510 --> 00:33:45.920
 showing

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:54.080
 those humble, simple, long to the earth, with both each other, and share the knowledge those

00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:59.840
 who are interested, and those actually going to have benefit, again with the basic things,

00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:08.160
 those are known as teaching, generosity, very again both each other, and the next one, third one,

00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:16.080
 is the protraction methods, and the protraction is again needed people, in samsara there's so

00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:27.440
 many people are on fear, f-e-a-r, fears, the fears, so any kind of like relief that we can do give,

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:35.360
 again with both each other, with compassion, with loving kindness, whatever relief, whatever

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:36.080
 support

00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:42.560
 you can give to them, with your cover minutes, by your cover minutes, whatever you do,

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:48.240
 whether those are the skills, the methods, or considerations, what's the concept,

00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:59.840
 consolations, advicings, or what kind of ease, so their mind will not to worry, not so fear,

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:07.360
 not so scared, or somebody in the big dangers, then kind of can protect, save them, someday

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:15.920
 their lives, give the protections, good protraction, or medicines, medicines, any general such as

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:16.400
 then,

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:22.560
 if they're a star or give me something, that also material give, but same time is the protraction

00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:32.560
 gives, keeps protecting them, whatever you do to protect, save them, again with compassion,

00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:44.080
 with both each other, those are all known as generous practices, again as I said, generous

00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:52.480
 practice, each of those when you do, if you remember, do dedication, as what I said Buddha,

00:35:52.480 --> 00:36:03.440
 when the Buddha give his body, what is the dedication? May all living beings are

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:10.160
 liberated by my generation, those who are not liberated by the previous Buddha. I think that

00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:17.600
 is all. Another one, also what Buddha said in the previous lifetime, as what we count by this,

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:25.120
 some may come here as well, may I agree, as we count every day, and now I can

00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:36.880
 remember that story, how I said it, by this may all obtain omenya, may it defeat any wrongdoing,

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:43.280
 from the stormy waves of birth and all that in sickness and death, and from all hymns of samsara,

00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:49.920
 may I pray all means. This is also one of those previous time, the previous lifetime, so the

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:56.400
 British teacher, Buddha Shatamuni, guided after he gave the life, maybe this is really after this,

00:36:56.400 --> 00:37:02.240
 he give up his body, turtle, sittur to give up his body to this 80 thodent,

00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:11.840
 thodent of this essence, that after he joined this one. So if you remember that 80 times when you

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:19.680
 did something good did, you dedicated that merit to benefit all living beings. That is really

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:20.480
 perfect,

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:26.880
 beautiful. Start with beautiful motivation, intention as bodhicata, and you did give that

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:35.040
 without any grasping, clinging or pure gives, give and ending with good wishes, good intentions,

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:41.920
 good thought. It's wholesome, the perfect, completely practices or total practices,

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:49.680
 practicing and following footsteps of the great teacher, Buddha Shatamuni, and all with us,

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:57.360
 the ears, all the victorious sun and the turtles, so then we are really following that. So that is

00:37:57.360 --> 00:38:04.000
 what about generously practice, generously, generously, then maybe I talk a little bit about

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:17.120
 morality. Now morality is in Sanskrit is shila, shila practice, shila. Shila is Sanskrit a bit

00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:23.920
 translated into English, then I think is like morality then, but every word translated exactly

00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:34.000
 shila, according to Sanskrit word it will be like cool, c-o-o-l, cool. So truly morality is cool,

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:41.840
 very cool. If you have good ethics, a good morality, no matter wherever you go, you will be

00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:49.840
 cool guys, truly you will be cool guys, and sooner you will become the stars, not just the cool

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:50.400
 guys.

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:59.680
 Hanayali is good for morality, is cool, and in Sanskrit in teachings also cool means what is that?

00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:07.040
 In the teachings when you have the moralities it will cool because you will be not tormented

00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:15.040
 by the heat of the emotions, heat of the emotions. So then you become cool, cool as a cool

00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:15.680
 breathing

00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:22.560
 sitting under the little fruit trees, trees in the shade or in hard times, so those are the

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:33.200
 meaning words. But what is the nature of this morality? Nature of the morality is avoiding,

00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:43.520
 avoiding, that's it, avoiding. And what is the nature of the generosity? As I said give way,

00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:55.520
 giving. Generous nature is giving way, morality is avoiding. What is avoiding? All the negative

00:39:55.520 --> 00:40:07.680
 it is, all the negative it is, I like to avoid, negative it is. And all the mistakes and errors

00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:15.360
 I like to avoid, avoid. That is the mistakes, the errors according to the worldly level,

00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:22.880
 human ethics, and mistakes, the errors of them in the teaching, according to the teaching

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:33.360
 that I like to avoid. All they speak is vows, vows and the samayas, those like to be avoided.

00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:41.840
 When you have that attitude, I'm not going to become strained by the negative emotions,

00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:50.320
 activated. Have that attitude strongly in the heart and mind, and that is always in the mind,

00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:59.360
 that is known as the nature of the morality. That is also very much, that nature, that attitude

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:06.960
 like to avoid, that also means that individually is always in the mindfulness, and the otherness,

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:19.040
 and consciousness. Therefore, it always remain beautiful, simple, perfect, and not going to fall

00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:30.240
 in either side, extremes of any side, and remain on the line in simple, humble, gentle, peaceful

00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:30.560
 ways.

00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:42.800
 That is really the nature or the meaning of the moralities. So that is my teaching for today,

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:48.400
 and then we could do it again, going to talk this, and think, okay, everyone, everyone, I think I'm

00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:55.520
 going to say one thing, more things, one thing. Yesterday what I said, yesterday I said this six

00:41:55.520 --> 00:42:04.880
 part of that can be, not can be summarized as two merits, accumulation merit and wisdom merit.

00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:13.840
 I said to accumulation merit is the force in generosity and morality is accumulation merit.

00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:23.680
 And the wisdom last month is wisdom merit. It's a paramata, last paramata,

00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:32.720
 wisdom paramata is wisdom merit. And then three of them is a support and assistant to both.

00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:40.800
 I said that. That's also true. That is also in the teaching manual. But also in other teaching

00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:49.840
 manual, this again is slightly different. So the first three are the accumulation merits.

00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:58.800
 Last two are the wisdom merits. Last two means concentration paramata

00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:10.320
 and the wisdom paramedas are wisdom merit. And then the fourth one, which is joyful effort,

00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:18.080
 is assistant to both, all parliaments. So that is slightly different, different, which also in the

00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:25.600
 teaching mentioned that. So I just thought to highlight that. The fourth one, what I said

00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:32.640
 yesterday is also correct, true, in the teaching manual. And what I said today,

00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:41.040
 said another way, that is also in the teaching said is correct. There's not any contradiction,

00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:48.800
 but it's slightly with how to grouping these two to accumulation merit. Which is also in the

00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:56.960
 teaching, we use another word, accumulation merit, also can be named as related truth

00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:05.680
 merit, true activities. And this wisdom merit is also named as absolute merit, true activities.

00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:13.680
 So this is again, so that is different way to explore in the aspect or the meaning of those

00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:23.760
 merit is all that paramedas and the sixth parameda is a whole body of practices,

00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:29.520
 practice of the entire Mahayana Buddhism and the Vayayana Buddhism.

00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:38.320
 Thank you very much everyone. Thank you, now we do again for meditation. And then today we do

00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:46.160
 a little bit, we're going to join the Buddha mantras. Today is very special day is full moon,

00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:52.240
 full moon. And so of course, it's all the same, but we just highlight a little bit Buddha.

00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:57.920
 Buddha, so I think you all have this booklet and I'm going to highlight this of the work that this

00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:05.200
 practices and then we practice too. We do the exact same practices, but when we come to the

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:10.480
 mantra of the meditation of the many other Buddhas, that we join the upper head of the

00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:26.000
 healing practices, that time they will highlight this and then do the practice.

00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:44.960
 Thank you.
