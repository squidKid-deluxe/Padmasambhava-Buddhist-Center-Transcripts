00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.920
 This devotion again is so spiritual and important, and for that reason, throughout the teachings,

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:15.680
 which even practice meditation or name, we practice such as Zochen, Mahamudaras,

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:22.480
 or the Mademakas, or like Shiji or the pacifying techniques.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:29.280
 Or whatever we practice, devotion is the most important.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:35.760
 And often in the teachings say that when you have the devotion, then blessing will enter.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.080
 Blessings will enter, that means that moment you get the relaxation.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.680
 Realization is the blessings. Some light of the Buddha's blessings and the condition of that

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:53.200
 blessings will come through the window of the of our devotion is open, and that's what really,

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.240
 then merge together, cause and condition work together and bring the enlightenment.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.400
 And similarly, for that reason, the great Buddha or common Buddha,

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.600
 Vaikir said in his teaching, "The salt-born realization will promote your wisdom,

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:15.360
 will shine or will drown or shine by the devotions." He said that.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.520
 And this is again, all those great masters, realization beings,

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.680
 repeatedly one after another, mentioned that as like pit and stuck and executive message,

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.120
 after we kind of went through the inquiries of the investigation, analyze, intellectual, all that,

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:37.280
 but when it began to settle and bloom in the lecture in the heart, and that really, we need that.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.120
 And then knowledge is already, we develop through the investigation, analyzing all the

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.240
 contemplation,

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.880
 and then the realization shines, and then beauty, both externally scholar,

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.040
 in a completely realization beings, that all come through it. So that is known as that.
