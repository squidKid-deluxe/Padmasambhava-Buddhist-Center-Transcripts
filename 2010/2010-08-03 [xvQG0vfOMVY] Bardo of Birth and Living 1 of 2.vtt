00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.520
 It is ours. It is ours. It is ours. It's truly it is. It's not someone's hand. In the right hand,

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:14.400
 the Bardo of Death, we didn't really actualize, we didn't make this familiar.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:24.400
 Then, the Bardo of Death and Dying, Bardo of the True Natural, and other Bardos, or mostly it's the

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:33.220
 other's hand. We just see how much luck we have, or how much that's it. It's kind of the expert in

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.000
 luck.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.760
 And this is in our hand. This is in our direction. So therefore, always in the teaching set, this

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:49.740
 is so important. Once we have this, as I've said, we can move everything with confidence, bright,

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.400
 fearless, joy, and fierce.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:59.190
 And even sometimes the teaching set, for example, they use the example. Tebza Tsewang Rinpoche. Teb

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.800
za Tsewang Rinpoche. Tebza Tsewang Rinpoche. Tebza Tsewang Rinpoche. There is one bird, it must be.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:09.060
 One bird is so cautious, I think in the teaching set, bird is so cautious, this bird, or the mother

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.200
 bird, makes it so cautious that it makes bird nest, nest.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:22.520
 And everything she sees is offered in the bird's head, then she makes bird, so she makes nest. When

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.430
 she makes that nest, after that, she doesn't have to worry concerning anything. She enters that

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:34.600
 with confidence, just without any thoughts, without any worries and anxieties.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:41.320
 And similarly in the teaching set, if we really, our kind of power, or actually our kind of

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:48.450
 experience, and rely on this part of the bird in the living, then all other parts will move with

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.600
 confidence.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:02:06.600
 There is no scaling, no unsure, no any hesitations. That's the really teaching set. And that's what

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.600
, again, we witness by many great practitioners, masters, and many mongers on this subject.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:16.680
 All treated with joy, with happy, with excitement, with great contribution, they move. Without even

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:24.600
 slight of the doubt and pulling back this and that worried anxiety, just flow away in the way.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:31.590
 That's what really how it is. So therefore, this part of the bird in the living is so important.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:39.810
 And when we recount this prayer as one more stroke at the time, and then we move to the next, this

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.600
 setting of art.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.600
 In the very tuning that you all have discussed.
