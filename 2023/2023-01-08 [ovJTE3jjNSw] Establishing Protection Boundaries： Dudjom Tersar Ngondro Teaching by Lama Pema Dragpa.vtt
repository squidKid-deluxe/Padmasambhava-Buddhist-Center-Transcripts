NOTE     "synopsis": "Brief Teaching on the Dudjom Tersar Ngondro\nby Lama Pema Dragpa\n\nJanuary 7, 2023\nPadma Samye Ling\n\n--\n\n\u201cThe Buddha appointed Kashyapa to be his regent, saying, \u201cI will give you my whole teaching. Keep, maintain, preserve, and spread my teaching, then give it to Ananda.\u201d The word \u2018keep\u2019 here means to make certain the teachings are not lost. \u2018Maintain\u2019 means to connect with, practice, and live the teachings. \u2018Preserve\u2019 means not to corrupt or alter the meaning of the teachings. \u2018Spread\u2019 means to disseminate the teachings.\u201d\n\nVenerable Khenpo Rinpoches\n\"Light of Peace: How Buddhism Shines in the World\" (pg 29)\n\n--\n\n\u201cFrom this time onward, as long as beings exist,\nMay I and others accomplish the general and essential teachings.\nBy holding, protecting, and spreading them throughout the universe,\nMay the teachings of the Lake Born Buddha flourish.\u201d\n\nJamgon Mipham Rinpoche\n\"Tengye Monlam: An Aspiration for the Spread of the Nyingma Teachings: The Oral Transmission That Gladdens the Dharma Kings\"\n\n--\n\nAs an offering to interested Sangha members, Ven.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.280
 Thank you, friends. Thank you. Thank you all. It's a great joy to be here once again, to

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:21.440
 really take the time to come to reflect on and absorb the Dharma into our hearts, into

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.560
 our minds, into our lives. So really, it's quite a celebration, actually. So I really

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.680
 feel that kind of brightness to actually have that opportunity. And so along with

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:38.260
 that great brightness and just the relief of the Dharma, wow, we actually have the

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.780
 Dharma. Then let's really reactivate that, that freshness, that connection, the deep,

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.960
 warm-hearted kind of sizzling sensation of kind of gratitude and preciousness and

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.760
 for ourselves, for our situation, for our friends and family, for the world. And

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.480
 we'll reactivate that in our hearts and our minds right now. So we do that in

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.480
 these three ways, which are these pithy essential points for any Vajrayana

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.320
 Tibetan Buddhist practitioner is renunciation, bodhicitta, and pure

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.960
 perception. So renunciation, we're going to renounce the causes of suffering. So

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.040
 that's a great self-love. We're going to really appreciate what we have, all the

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.040
 goodness and the virtue, the amazing qualities we have, the world has, that

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.200
 this opportunity affords. So really kind of turn on that gratitude, that joy and

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.560
 appreciation, and a really kind of tender, kind of loving, kind of really alive way.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.040
 So we try to really reactivate that fresh joy and appreciation. Then at the

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.680
 same time, we want all beings, every single being, to be totally supported and

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:46.640
 loved and cared for and uplifted and protected and just really nourished in

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.720
 all the ways, to be free of all the troubles and the causes of trouble. So

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.800
 this bodhicitta, this really active heart-mind of enlightenment, this is like

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.760
 really not just kind of lip service, we're really trying to turn that on, to

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.240
 really think for all beings who are coming here to practice, to kind of

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.280
 contemplate the Dharma, so that this time together, this moment, can be one of the

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.760
 principal conditions that all beings will finally have ongoing happiness and

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.520
 freedom forever, every single being. So we kind of really kind of try to brighten

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.480
 that bodhicitta, and then at the same time, they'd kind of see this more the

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.080
 kind of essential goodness or the purity, that kind of amazing kind of dazzling

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.760
 display of experience, of the world, of ourselves, this pure perception and these

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.480
 three vajras, pure body, pure speech, pure mind, pure form, pure sound, pure space,

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.080
 and we really try to connect with our goodness nature first, and then allow its

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.960
 expressive, energetic quality, its cognizance, its knowing quality, its

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:56.360
 display capacity, to shine out from that goodness and experience everything as

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.000
 being essentially all good. This is kind of more the pure perception, so we're

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.400
 really kind of brighten all three of those. Renunciation, bodhicitta,

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.520
 pure perception.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:41.440
 Wonderful. So it's an amazing thing we have this time together, this experience.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:47.880
 The topic today specifically is kind of put the title as being establishing

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:56.240
 protection boundaries. Establishing protection boundaries. That's kind of the

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.800
 little zone of reality we're gonna circle around here for just a short

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.420
 period of time. Establishing protection boundaries. I looked up in our daily

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.840
 prayer sadhana, the PVC daily prayer sadhana, how many times does the word

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:19.160
 protect arise in that sadhana? 51 times. It's like a hundred page book. This is

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:25.640
 such an important topic in Buddhism. Protection. And then I'm gonna start a

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:30.200
 little more generally and then go more into the Buddhism and then specifically

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:35.440
 into Tibetan Buddhism. But I wanted to, at first, I really thought I wanted to say

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.480
 this, like specifically out of the gate around establishing protection

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:49.520
 boundaries. Everyone's really needed now. Each of us, we're really needed now. We

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.400
 have this amazing Dharma. We're a part of a living lineage. We have these living

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.000
 guides. We have this goods and nature. We have the techniques that we really know

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.880
 how to be happy. We really know how to undo the causes of suffering. And we know

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:10.960
 how to do it quickly. And we know how to have a big view to do it for all beings.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:17.920
 The skillful means the path is really clear. It's a great fortune. It's one of

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:25.240
 parts of the great fortunes of having the 18 endowments. And we're all needed.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:32.120
 So this time, I just wanted to say that right out of the gate, please hang on.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:38.440
 Please keep activating your bodhicitta. It really all comes down to bodhicitta.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:43.960
 All the levels of the teaching. The great zogchen tantras, a lot of them are called

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:49.160
 bodhicitta. Sutra Mahayana is the essence of Sutra Mahayana, the heart of all of it.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:56.040
 Infinite compassion, one of the four boundless qualities. Really, we have all the things

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:03.520
 we need. This is like the perfect time for us to step in and really help because the

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.640
 energy is going to get strong. It's already strong, right? So many experiences, so

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:15.520
 much display, so much speed. There's so many things coming out now. One after

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.960
 another, after another, after another. And we all have different experiences of

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.920
 this and perceptions of it and interpretations, but I kind of just

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:26.880
 wanted to start with a really heartfelt wish. Please, just like Trungpa Rinpoche

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:30.560
 said, it is right as he was introducing Shambhala Tirma teaching lineage in the

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:37.800
 early 80s. The world needs you. The world needs you. Like sentient beings, they need

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:48.160
 us. And of course, we need them too. This is part of our practice. So please, off the

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:54.600
 gate, or out of the gate, please. Bodhicitta, please, please. I said it to

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:59.120
 myself too. It's not the time to check out. It's not the time to tune out. It's not

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:04.160
 the time to just kind of wall off. And so then this is specifically related to this

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:09.360
 topic. Establishing protection boundaries. Because we want to serve the teachings.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:15.400
 We want to serve all beings. This is bodhicitta. But we're actually human

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:19.040
 beings too. And we have this Buddha nature that's to some degree coming,

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:23.040
 turning on, turning off, probably, for sentient beings. Off, on, off, off, off, off,

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:28.560
 off, off, off, off, off, off, off, off, off, off, whatever. The de novo one's on, all the

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:32.080
 time. Turn the light on, it stays on.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:38.400
 So how do we protect that? That aspiration? The wish? That genuine bodhisattva

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:42.280
 wish? May I serve the teachings and beings for as long as it takes till

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:45.920
 every single being is free from suffering and the causes of suffering? How

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:51.600
 do we care for that wish? How do we follow through on that vow that we took?

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:58.000
 The bodhisattva vow? That's really this question. How do we establish protection

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.560
 boundaries? What do we do to care for that? Okay, so then I thought to

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:08.560
 divide this in general, first in general. Every system that's a living system

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:14.600
 that's healthy has boundaries. Everything has like a context. The Buddha taught

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:19.120
 this so clearly. Everything's dependently arisen and things arise depending on

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:24.280
 causes and conditions. And they extend in a network of causes and conditions.

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:32.320
 Everything has a frame. Our perceptions have, they only go, extend so far, right?

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:36.280
 Our thoughts, they always hover within the realm of our habitual patterns. Our

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:41.960
 alaya extends within its own region. Even generally, not talking about Buddhist

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:48.160
 anything, every single healthy system needs to have permeable membranes. It

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:53.920
 needs to discern what it takes in, what it doesn't take in. What do I eat that

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:57.640
 will help me? What do I not eat that will not help me? We need to have that

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:01.720
 discernment, that intelligence, both for our mind and then living systems really

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:09.300
 need to establish that. These are called protective boundaries. Why? So then we can

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:12.880
 really care for what we're holding, what we're containing, what we're honoring,

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:18.080
 what we've committed to be a part of, to work with, to learn from. And we can't

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:22.540
 just take it all at once. We can't just do every practice at once. We have to

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:27.100
 actually set a boundary. I'm gonna do this practice, or I'm gonna care, I'm gonna

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:32.640
 be in a relationship with this person, or I'm gonna pursue this job, or I mean just

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:37.540
 all these tasks, we choose these kind of limited spheres that we work in a very

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:42.340
 specific context that's bounded. And it's not, that's actually just how things

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:47.240
 work. Everything has boundaries, and the boundaries always kind of moving, flexing,

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:54.040
 and flowing. So there's no option to not have boundaries. There's no option to not,

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:59.640
 to just be unbounded. What does that mean? Boundless compassion. It means work within

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:03.960
 the boundaries that you're kind of a part of, and they go on infinitely. But

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:07.680
 it's infinite boundaries, all these different systems interacting with each

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:12.400
 other. It's not just a big mishmash, it's not that the inside of your body, your

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:17.040
 heart has no heart, no wall, and your, it's not, there's all these separate

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:21.560
 segmented systems that have boundaries, and communication, what goes in, what goes

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:29.240
 out, how it absorbs, how fast. Like these are really specific, exact, very precise

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:35.200
 permeable membranes. And the Dharma is no different. The Dharma is just heightened,

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:39.120
 because we're not just looking at what's really tangible and obvious. We're also,

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:44.520
 in addition, looking at what's really subtle. Karma, cause and effect, cause

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:50.160
 conditions and results. And a lot of this is so subtle, imperceptible, definitely

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:57.240
 disentient mind. So the question is, what boundaries am I choosing to work with?

00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:05.700
 And so protection, and there's three things I thought with, in terms of

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:12.320
 protection, what am I trying to protect? And then protection from what? I'm trying

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:20.320
 to protect that from what? And then how? How do I protect it? So Buddhism has so

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:23.280
 many different answers to this. The Buddha taught so many different answers

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:29.000
 to these three questions. What am I protecting? Fundamentally, we're protecting

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:35.960
 our mind. All Buddha's teachings come down to discipline the mind, tame the mind.

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:41.560
 What does that mean? It means we have this essential goodness, this true nature,

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:45.740
 what's called Buddha nature, or bodhicitta, this natural heart mind of

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:50.360
 enlightenment. We have to protect it from shutting down. We have to protect it from

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:55.600
 turning off. We have to protect it from duality mind, right? Fixation on me and

00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:00.880
 my stuff and what I want and my expectations. All these ways of forgetting,

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:06.200
 of being distracted from the true nature. So so many of the teachings and

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:10.400
 techniques are about how do we protect our mind, the true awareness? How do we

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:17.600
 protect wisdom mind from shutting down into duality mind? So mantra, mantra, mind

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:22.480
 protection, that's essentially what it is. These skillful means techniques, how to

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:26.680
 abide in the nature, that's actually what yoga is in Buddhism, to abide in the

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:33.280
 nature. How do I use secondary conditions and supports? Skillful means to about to

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:39.720
 recognize the nature and stay in the nature, be natural. So one, what am I

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:46.080
 protecting? That's called in Buddhism the original protector, the nature of mind,

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:53.320
 the Buddha nature. And Kenpo Sangham Danyarobhiche gave three months of teachings on

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:57.320
 Shabkar's flight of the Garuda and he talked a lot about the original

00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:02.960
 protector. Tibetan Buddhism is sometimes talked about as youthful based body or

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:09.280
 bodhicitta or Buddha nature or essential goodness. The different levels of

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:12.280
 teachings talk about the kind of point towards this in different ways depending

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:16.600
 what framing or what context, what environment, what boundaries are more

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:24.280
 digestible than the Buddha would kind of match that system, that game, that mind.

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:31.960
 So what am I protecting? Fundamentally I'm protecting the true nature from my

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:39.680
 misrecognition, my mistaken perception, my ignorance. Okay so then there's so many

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:45.760
 things, what am I protecting? We always say I'm gonna protect the Dharma, protect

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:50.520
 the teachings, protect the Dharma. What does it mean protect the Dharma? This is

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:54.560
 so beautiful, this really struck me so much. In Venerable Kambaramapche is the

00:13:54.560 --> 00:14:01.200
 book Light of Peace, how Buddhism shines in this world. And so many times in this

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:04.960
 book when the Buddha, the Rinpoche is here, they're talking about the seven

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:09.400
 patriarchs, how after Buddha Shakyamuni passed like how his lineage was maintained.

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:15.320
 And then they say on page 29, the Buddha was saying to the, as he appointed the

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:22.000
 first regent, Kashapa. Buddha Shakyamuni said this, here's on page 29, the Buddha

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.800
 appointed Kashapa to be his regent saying, "I will give you my whole teaching.

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:37.520
 Keep, maintain, preserve, and spread my teaching, and then give it to Ananda." So

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:40.680
 that's what the Buddha said. And then Venerable Kambaramapche's give commentary.

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:47.640
 The word keep here means to make certain the teachings are not lost.

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:59.120
 Maintain means to connect with, practice, and live the teachings. Preserve means to

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:07.760
 not corrupt or alter the meaning of the teachings. Spread means to disseminate

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:15.120
 the teachings. So again, I will give you my whole teaching. Keep, maintain, preserve,

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:21.920
 and spread my teaching, and then give it to Ananda. This is the exact same, this

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:28.000
 phrase, keep, maintain, preserve, and spread was the exact statement that each

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.240
 of the regents, each of the patriarchs said to the next one as they handed the

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:36.880
 full lineage teaching and the full responsibility to maintain, keep, preserve,

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:41.920
 and spread that lineage teaching. So what are we protecting? And we say, I want to

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:49.040
 protect the Dharma, or serve the Dharma. This is what we're doing. I mean, honestly,

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:54.120
 that's what we're all kind of learning to, like, how to do that. What's the full

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:57.920
 scope of Buddha's teaching? Well, you could say that in a different way. How is

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:02.120
 reality, how is the, how are all natural systems, how do all natural systems

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:08.000
 function? That's what the Buddha's pointing at. Naturalness in all contexts.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.800
 And then, not just to map that, or think about that, or have memorized something,

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:20.800
 but totally mingle that with your being, to live it, to absorb it, to become

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:25.120
 totally natural, where it's not the nature over there, and I'm over here, the

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:29.320
 Dharma's over there, and I'm over here, like I'm watching it somehow. But to

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:33.080
 really let it affect me, and shape me, and change me, transform me, have the

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:37.640
 Dharma really change me so that I become more natural, so my true nature is

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:43.280
 protected from its unnatural habit to shut down, and turn off, and seal itself

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:47.600
 in a little cocoon, a protection boundary that doesn't help it. It actually is like

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:57.120
 a prison. It's not a permeable membrane, it's a closed prison cell. So to protect

00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:05.080
 the Dharma, that's another thing to protect. My true nature? Then the Dharma.

00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:12.520
 Protect sentient beings. To serve sentient beings. That's the wish of the

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:19.360
 Bodhisattva. And there's so many ways to unpack this, but one we know. The six

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:25.760
 paramitas, the first paramita is generosity. And that paramita of generosity

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:33.120
 is subdivided into three. The third generosity is to protect from fear. And

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:40.280
 another way you talk about that is extending life. Life is so precious. Why?

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:46.280
 Because mind is so precious, and mind needs a body. Without a body, without a

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:52.080
 living body, the mind starts wondering. As long as we're a sentient being, we feel

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:57.320
 like we need to be embodied. And we are embodied. We're embodied, embedded, extended.

00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:01.200
 All this, we're really, you have this, we're in the world. It's form and

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:06.960
 emptiness. We're through form. What's so the deepest, a big, like the third

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:12.360
 generosity is to protect from fear. Extend life. Then what's the point of extending

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:21.960
 life? To serve the Dharma. To protect the Dharma. To serve all beings. To protect

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:27.440
 all beings. This is easier said than done, because it goes right back to our

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:31.440
 question. All beings, we all have different boundaries. Different ways of

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:35.840
 understanding things. Different ways of perceiving. So then we have to get really

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:40.440
 clear with our wisdom. How do you make sense of things? How do you, what's

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:44.600
 happening in your own experience, in your mind, in your heart? Because otherwise

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:48.720
 we're taking our boundaries, and we're gobbling up someone else's world. And

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:54.080
 we're saying you have to play my game. But someone doesn't want to play my

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:59.360
 game. They're already doing their game. They have their world. I have my ego

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:06.640
 clinging. They have their ego clinging. So then, skillfully, how do I actually, what

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:10.160
 is this? It's all this idea of like, how do you put yourself in someone else's

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:17.520
 shoes, right? That's the how to protect. We really need to viscerally try to, that's

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:21.000
 the whole path of bodhisattva and bodhicitta. We're trying to viscerally

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:30.600
 experience others as ourselves as more dear than ourselves. Like someone else

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:35.720
 has something going on with them. And just like, it's so painful. Like we feel

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:44.080
 it so sensitively. Because we're so cued in or tuned in or aligned with their

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:51.600
 world, with their boundaries. And then this is where it's about the issue of

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:56.040
 permeable membrane. We need to know what to take in, what to take out. What to, like,

00:19:56.040 --> 00:20:00.360
 leave out or how to remove something that becomes not so good in our system, in my

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:04.720
 mind. We need to take out the poison, right? These negative emotions. These

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:10.960
 cognitive obscurations. Really, we really have to emphasize this wisdom part too.

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:16.200
 So not only the compassion, but the wisdom, the discernment. To clearly see

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:20.520
 how things are working, what causes and conditions are working. And at the same

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:24.840
 time, it's all a dream. This is all an illusion. It's like a memory being

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:31.000
 created. It's like a movie. I'm not saying that as if I've done that, but it's so

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.600
 clear on the absolute bodhicitta level of Buddha's teachings. That's a really

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:39.000
 fundamentally important, especially as the room starts spinning more and faster

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.680
 and faster and more creative ways. Unexpected, surprising ways. This wisdom

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:48.880
 of seeing the illusory nature of things. And that also just means of seeing very

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:54.560
 refined interdependence. How things are coming together. How things are coming

00:20:54.560 --> 00:21:00.640
 apart. And to work with that skillfully. As we viscerally experience someone

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:05.800
 else's world, as we develop more that capacity, we can't forget that this is

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:11.400
 just a dream. Otherwise, we don't have healthy boundaries. We don't have, we're

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:16.040
 not protecting our boundaries. We're not establishing good protection boundaries.

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:22.720
 We're just taking everything on with no discernment. The wisdom component really

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:27.480
 has to be there. That's kind of jumping ahead a little bit. But what else are we

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:32.480
 protecting? We're protecting this precious opportunity to actually manifest our

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:36.720
 nature more fully, to shine out brighter for beings. Why do we want to have

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:41.880
 a long healthy life? So that we can serve the teachings and beings longer. More

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:45.280
 effectively. That we have this opportunity to learn how to do it better.

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:52.240
 More carefully. More full of care. More sensitively. More

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:59.000
 quantumously. More evenly. We need the opportunity to extend longer. If

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.200
 we're like lost wondering beings, I need more time to stabilize. I definitely do

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:08.320
 personally. We're protecting our motivation. This little baby bodhicitta.

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:14.880
 We're protecting our future lives. By cultivating a virtuous mind now, we're

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:19.360
 protecting a virtuous mind in the future. Because it's cause and effect. Caring

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:24.560
 for this now, it naturally is going to extend into the future. Virtue leads to

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:32.560
 virtue. Non-virtue leads to non-virtue. So those are kind of things about what

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:35.640
 are we protecting when we talk about established protection boundaries in

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:40.360
 Buddhism? We're protecting our mind. We're protecting our true nature. We're

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:43.840
 protecting our duality mind from not becoming more dualistic, but less

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:48.120
 dualistic. We're aiming towards less dualistic so until we can get free and

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:51.560
 be non-dual or have wisdom. We're protecting the teachings. We're

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:55.400
 protecting the beings. We're protecting our commitment. We're protecting the

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:58.400
 opportunity to last longer. We're protecting the opportunity to last

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:04.400
 longer for other people. We're protecting the future. These are all things we're

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:10.820
 doing in Buddhism. We talk about protect. Then protect from what? What are we

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:16.040
 protecting from? And his only is due to Rinpoche. It's beautiful. He calls these

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:20.960
 the three obstacles. These are like all the obstacles we face or the

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:25.020
 disruptions, the things that will kind of shut our mind down, make it really

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:28.400
 difficult for our true nature to shine out, called the three obstacles. In

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:34.080
 liberating duality, Rinpoche's book on eight emanations of Gurir Rinpoche, then

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:37.320
 his only is due to Rinpoche has a prayer in the back called a prayer to Gurir

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:42.240
 Rinpoche that swiftly removes obstacles and fulfills all wishes. And then page

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:47.600
 two of this prayer is page 123. His Holiness due to Rinpoche says, "Earthquakes,

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:52.800
 fires, hurricanes, droughts, floods, and the like, please remove all the outer

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:58.760
 obstacles of natural disasters externally. All kinds of illnesses of heat, cold,

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:03.640
 wind, bile, phlegm, and their combinations, please remove all the inner obstacles of

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:09.960
 physical imbalances internally. The neurotic five poisons of mind, attachment,

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:14.560
 anger, and the demon of hope and fear, please remove all the secret obstacles

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:21.220
 of mental imbalances into pervasive space." He's praying to Guru Padmasambhava

00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:28.360
 to remove these three obstacles, external obstacles, internal obstacles, and secret

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:33.600
 obstacles. These are the things we're trying to protect from. What are the

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:38.320
 external obstacles? They're like any, all these outer environment situations that

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:42.320
 could be weather related, it could be people related, food related, any of these

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:47.240
 circumstances which we're in. If they really threaten us, if they cause our

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:53.040
 bodhicitta to turn off, if they cause our enthusiasm to dharma, to dim, this is an

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:59.720
 external obstacle. Then an internal obstacle is when our body gets sick, when

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:02.840
 our winds get all kind of funny, and then all of a sudden we become a

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:09.400
 little more erratic, really tired, really depressed, too excited, too scattered, very

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:16.440
 restless. These are the inner obstacles, because why? Our true nature is shutting

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:21.440
 down. We have to protect it from shutting down. This is an inner obstacle, secret

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:26.720
 obstacle, is when then as the kind of all the internal winds are happening, and

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:30.880
 maybe external pressure, then all these kind of things is emotional, they call

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:36.400
 emotional turbulence, unexpected upheavals. You know you're having a good day, all

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:42.740
 of a sudden it's so dark inside, so obscured, so really tense, so reactive,

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:50.120
 and there's no real apparent reason. This is called a secret obstacle. As we

00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:54.400
 practice, the practice gets us into some more and more subtle layers of our mind.

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:59.640
 More and more subtle level habits are revealed, and these come out, these habits

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:03.840
 start to come out, and they come out as secret obstacles. All of a sudden we

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:08.000
 don't want to practice anymore. All of a sudden we don't have devotion. In His

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.600
 Holiness, Durya Rinpoche's mountain retreat instructions, he really

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:14.560
 pinpoints these. These are very specific moments for practitioners. We have to

00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:19.000
 reaffirm our bodhicitta, our commitment, our dedication to the dharma. We have to

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.400
 really reestablish protection boundaries here, reconnect to the dharma, our

00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:28.080
 annunciation, bodhicitta, pure perception. I'm saying this from my own experience.

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:33.120
 Not that I can do this well, but these internal obstacles and upheavals, they

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:38.640
 come. Everything's great, all things wonderful, all of a sudden everything's

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:45.360
 horrible, you know. Or the opposite, too. It's okay, but it's so wonderful, I love it,

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:55.400
 dharma's so great, yeah, like pop, right? Bubble enthusiasm, so easy to pop, and it's

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:59.720
 usually related to some kind of upheaval inside. It's not, we're not really, it's

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:03.500
 not a permeable membrane that's intelligent. It's just something pops

00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:09.560
 unexpectedly, we kind of ride the wave, but eventually the wave crashes. So this

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:14.860
 is a third obstacle. External obstacles, internal obstacles, we get sick, for

00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:19.960
 example. Secret obstacles with our mind is doing. We have to protect from these.

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:27.740
 Then we jump to this next book. I won't go on too much longer. This is also taught

00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:34.680
 as, what are we protecting from? Four demons. There's two ways of talking about

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:37.960
 these four demons, and Ravic is talking about it, and they're cutting through ego

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:45.040
 and revealing fearlessness. This book on should. The four demons, there's two ways

00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:49.040
 of talking about it. There's more the philosophical way, and then there's the

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:53.900
 more experiential or practitioner way. These are the four demons we have to

00:27:53.900 --> 00:28:00.200
 overcome. We have to protect ourselves from. And the first demon, and that's just

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:07.040
 to say these quickly, that philosophical way. Demon of the aggregates, forms like

00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:12.840
 the, are just basically, you could say in one simple way, our body. Form and our

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:19.960
 mind's kind of obsession with how it is in this body. These aggregates. So much of

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:24.440
 what we do, say this, so much of what we do in our life is to care for this small

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:32.000
 little body, and this small little mouth, and this imperceptible mind. I want the

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:37.040
 clothes, and the soft things, and the nice smells, and the warm things, and I want

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:41.120
 people to say I'm great, and I want to eat the food I like, and then I'm gonna

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:46.220
 have some more food, and then I'll get some more food. We're really caring for

00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:50.320
 these aggregates. So much of the time, this is a demon of aggregates. Yeah, we

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:55.120
 have to care for our body, and what we eat, and I, you know, we have to be good. We

00:28:55.120 --> 00:29:00.440
 have to be a stand-up citizen. But do we have to be the best, most famous, most

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:05.960
 big influencer in the world, or something? This is a demon. Demon of the aggregates.

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:10.820
 And then they said the demon of death, the time will come where each of us, our minds,

00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:16.520
 will have to leave this rented, this rented room of this body, and it's that

00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:19.920
 time is unexpected, and at a certain point, we can't do anything to stop it.

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:25.280
 And then we don't have any more time to complete a virtuous activity, or to

00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:29.180
 recognize the nature of our mind. Then we get to see it's out of our control. This

00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:34.480
 is a demon of death. We have to prepare for this now, because that time's coming.

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:39.240
 We have to protect ourselves by preparing, right? There's nundra. Then the

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:43.060
 demon of negative emotions, the third, and then demon of distractions, the fourth.

00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:47.300
 Negative emotions? Of course, these are the five poisons. We can't let our true

00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:52.940
 nature be all muted by these five poisons. This is just common Buddhism. Then demon

00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:57.100
 of distraction, when people start saying, "Oh, you're so good. Oh, talk more. Oh,

00:29:57.100 --> 00:30:02.180
 this is so wonderful. Oh, your practice is so great. Oh, this and that." And then it's

00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:06.740
 gonna be very seductive to think I basically overestimate where I actually

00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:13.940
 am on the path, by being seduced by pride, essentially. We overestimate our, actually,

00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:18.460
 our bodhicitta. And then it's really, if you put yourself in a practice lineage,

00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:22.920
 this is, it's a good checks and balances for this, because there's so many

00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:29.220
 extraordinary masters that are way past you, way past me. To the Buddha,

00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:33.820
 Guru Rinpoche, the first 10th day, the first control, Mipham Rinpoche, his only

00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:38.740
 dude, Rinpoche. So many masters, his Karmapas, his holy Dalai Lama. I mean, they're

00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:43.220
 just extraordinary human beings, Bodhisattvas and Buddhas. And little old me,

00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:49.460
 I'm like, really nothing. Like the butt of a firefly. Like it's broken. It can't

00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:55.140
 even shine. It's so nothing compared to them. Not as if I'm bad, but just, they're

00:30:55.140 --> 00:31:01.480
 so bright. They're so beautiful. This demon of pride or demon of distraction is

00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:05.500
 really, we really have to protect from that because it'll basically stop all the

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:10.220
 growth. Our little baby bodhicitta, this little baby plant trying to grow, we're

00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:13.740
 gonna keep moving it with this, our pride. I think I'm already fully grown, but I'm

00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:19.660
 totally not. I think my samadhi is so strong or my dedication is so strong, but

00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:23.700
 it's like a little candle in the wind. I really have to protect that by looking

00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:28.380
 out for this demon of distraction. And then the other way of looking at this

00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:37.060
 demons is intangible demons, tangible demons, exhilaration and pride. Intangible

00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:42.700
 demons are anything of our sense doors. Like, or sorry, tangible demons, anything

00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:47.300
 we can sense with our senses. Intangible demons is all these mental objects,

00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:53.820
 ideas and emotions. Exhilaration. Wow. It's like this, again, this kind of bubble

00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:57.500
 enthusiasm or this kind of like, really, it's almost a restless, like energetic,

00:31:57.500 --> 00:32:01.260
 kind of frenetic quality. It's not even, there's not a sense of the illusory

00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:06.980
 nature. It's just a big puffing up, like kind of explosion. And then demon of

00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:12.440
 pride. Oh, I'm so good. Me, me, me. Ego-clinging. All these comes down to

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:16.860
 Rinpoche say again and again, the main demon is ego-clinging. When we do all

00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:21.140
 these wrathful practices, for example, we set things like protection boundaries.

00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:27.820
 What are we really protecting from? The main obstacle is ego-clinging. Me first.

00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:37.860
 I'm the best. I'm the most special. My practice. Always me. Me first. Of course,

00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:41.940
 we have to love ourselves. That's what a renunciation is all about. Self-care.

00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:46.220
 Really, like we're very valuable beings and there so are these infinite other

00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:50.900
 beings. We can't lose our perspective and can't be so exaggerated and

00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:55.500
 disproportionate. Have me be so central and have all the infinite other beings be

00:32:55.500 --> 00:33:01.100
 so secondary. We really have to reverse that. So then this gets into the how and

00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:08.020
 then I'll stop. How do we protect our mind and our practice and the dharma and

00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:12.460
 our service to beings and our bodhicitta? How do we protect it from these demons?

00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:16.940
 From these things that keep stopping us, our ego-clinging and all of its whole

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:23.340
 armies. How do we protect from being overcome by these obstacles? Basically,

00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:29.180
 how do we protect ourselves from becoming a fickle on/off practitioner? How

00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:33.900
 can we actually become smooth? Even how do we really mingle with the nature? How

00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:38.660
 can we really be where we are? Be in our body. Be with our minds, with care and

00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:43.540
 appreciation, curiosity, open-mindedness, with the fluidity. How do we do that?

00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:50.920
 There's so many ways to do this. So then we get establishing protection

00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:56.940
 boundaries. I'll quickly go through list. This is a big protector. The Buddha said

00:33:56.940 --> 00:34:01.900
 you are your own protector. You are your teacher. I showed you the path. You have

00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:06.580
 to follow. You have to take the path. You are your own protector. The three things

00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:10.980
 the Buddha taught, if we have these, we will be protected. We will be our own

00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:16.100
 protector. Mindfulness, alertness, conscientiousness. With these three, the

00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:20.540
 Buddha said it's like the Buddha is there with you in person. You become your

00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:24.460
 own protector. Mindfulness. You see what your mind's doing. Is my true nature

00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:29.140
 shining? Is my duality mind taking over? You see it as it's happening. Well at

00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:34.500
 first, if it's right, typically it's happening. Sentient mind is being sentient.

00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:41.940
 Me, not me. Self, other. And I am more important. Sentient mind. So then in that,

00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:46.100
 mindfulness is, okay, what do I do to undo that? Mindfulness is remembering the

00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:51.820
 teaching, the technique, and seeing what my mind needs right now to do that. Okay,

00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:56.420
 that's mindfulness. Alertness is we guard our senses. Okay, so say we become a

00:34:56.420 --> 00:35:00.220
 little mindful. We're seeing what our mind's doing as it's doing it. We guard

00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:04.460
 our senses. What is coming in the membrane? The boundary? And what is it

00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:08.460
 doing to my mind? What is the sound doing? What is the taste doing? What is the sight,

00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:13.020
 the image doing? What is it? How is it affecting my mind? This is becoming a

00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:17.300
 discerning membrane. This alertness. And then, okay, that's pretty interior. But

00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:22.300
 when we're with other beings, that's like, how am I in my daily life? When I walk

00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:25.620
 down the street, when I say hi to someone, when I go into a room and other

00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:29.740
 people are there, conscientiousness is like, is my behavior lining up with the

00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:34.140
 Dharma or not? So the first is really close. What's my mind doing now? Is it

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:37.380
 lining up with the teachings? And what's the instruction to help it attune to the

00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:42.160
 Dharma, to being natural? And then what's coming in to affect it? And then how is

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:47.040
 that displayed more outwardly with others? This is mindfulness, alertness,

00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:53.320
 conscientiousness. With these three, we will be our own protector. And then the

00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:57.520
 protection boundaries. There's so many techniques in Vajrayana. The protection

00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:03.520
 boundary, and it all comes down to bodhicitta. First we establish, like all

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:07.780
 this, all friends come. We have a ceremony. All good friends come, give a

00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:11.340
 gift, and invite them to use their good power and qualities to uplift the

00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:14.740
 bodhicitta. And anyone who doesn't want to be here and do that, oh, that's what

00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:18.820
 we're doing here. We're celebrating bodhicitta. Let's take this gift and be

00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:24.220
 satisfied and leave. Then we establish a protection boundary, protection tent. It

00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:30.700
 says, "This game here is bodhicitta." And we really establish kind of that. But

00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:35.960
 before that, we have all this emanating and Buddhism emanate and gather. You send

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:40.760
 out all these light rays to touch all beings, to have them be fulfilled with

00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:44.380
 loving-kindness, compassion, and wisdom. And they turn on, their Buddha nature

00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:50.880
 shines, and that comes back. There's all these relative, skillful means to connect

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:55.000
 with all beings, to have their nature reciprocally shine on, have our shine on,

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:00.000
 and their nature shines on. And that works with definitely with kind of all

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.000
 these deities and yidams and things which I won't go into. But kind of that's

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.260
 definitely part of the protection tent. Then there's so many things. There's

00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:11.780
 protection, amulets, and protection cords. What's that all related to lineage

00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:17.180
 blessings? Living noble beings who are like full-on embodiments of bodhicitta.

00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:21.820
 Then with their blessings, their living connection to the lineage, awakened

00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:28.180
 thread of enlightened and lineage energy, of wisdom energy. Then with the

00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:31.860
 power of their meditation, with their aspiration, with these ritual supports

00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:35.700
 and precious substances, their own meditation kind of mindfulness. Then

00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:39.420
 their blessed objects with the intention of being a support for our own minds to

00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:43.480
 relax and release and ease into their own essential goodness. So they have all

00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:48.740
 these kind of protective supports is on a more literal level. Wearing protective

00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:55.220
 amulets and protection cords, right? And asking for prayers of protection, asking

00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:58.700
 for prayers to remove obstacles. These are all helpful secondary supports and we

00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:09.860
 need them. And we rely on these Dharma protectors. There's Dharma protectors

00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:14.180
 that are enlightened and Dharma protectors that are not enlightened. We

00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:18.940
 need their help. They committed to Guru Rambhache, to actually use all their

00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:22.660
 abilities to keep the teachings in various ways, depending on their

00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:26.580
 abilities, to keep the teachings pure, right? To protect the teachings, to

00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:30.860
 protect beings, to protect the teachers, to protect practitioners. And we need

00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:35.940
 their support. We need to line up with them. We need to ask for their help.

00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:39.940
 Because sentient beings, there's all kinds, not just the ones human beings that we

00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:43.900
 see that our sense stories are currently available to. There's microscopic ones,

00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:47.460
 there's invisible ones, there's the ones far away, the Buddha taught about so many

00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:52.940
 beings. And these beings, some of them can really have made vows to

00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:56.500
 Guru Rambhache. And we need to like really humbly request that they honor

00:38:56.500 --> 00:39:01.660
 those vows, because we really need their support still. These times and this

00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:07.380
 degenerate time is getting rockier, you know, where we have all these teachings

00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:14.380
 from Guru Rambhache and the Buddha. And outwardly, I think it's very much

00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:20.020
 less gonna be, it's more and more gonna be like a charnel ground. Distractions

00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:25.580
 are so easy now. We don't have to go to some rocky place to have our own kind of

00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:31.900
 like inner energetic catch to happen. Just go any, it's just really kind of things

00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:38.360
 are swirling. So we have these teachings and we really need to like really apply

00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:42.660
 them in little ways, simple ways. We can protect ourselves, protect the dharma,

00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:46.340
 protect our minds, protect our goodness. And essentially in a more sutra way,

00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:51.660
 we're just protecting our virtuous mind. We're protecting our kindness, protecting

00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:56.820
 our common sense, protecting our just kind of our natural human empathetic

00:39:56.820 --> 00:40:01.300
 capacity, just be a good person. We're protecting that with the Buddha dharma.

00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:06.780
 And essentially that comes to my mind, knowing itself clearly. It is essentially

00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:13.940
 good. I am essentially loving, so are you. And we're amazingly wise. And so we're

00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:17.780
 kind of honoring that recognition and we're asking for help of the lineage of

00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:21.820
 our teachers and of ourselves. Bring out that quality, have that courage that's

00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:26.580
 also very gentle and humble. We can do this and really the world and beings, they

00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:31.580
 really need us. They need our help and then we really can become a protector.

00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:37.220
 Let's really say that the Buddha is a protector, a friend to all beings. And on

00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:41.860
 the path taking refuge as a Buddhist student and the Three Jewels are taking

00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:46.300
 refuge, we're aspiring to become protectors, really reliable protectors

00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:50.980
 for all beings. And we first show up as protectors in our own life by connecting

00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:54.920
 to that original protector of our own goodness nature, our own true nature of

00:40:54.920 --> 00:41:02.620
 mind. So that's it establishing protection boundaries. So much to say.

00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:08.660
 Thank you. Thank you.
