00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
 But then he said that when you have the realizations, the inconceivable billions of emanations are

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:14.280
 dispatched. And whatever is needed, whatever is continued by the six, and whatever varieties

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.480
 are needed to help presenting beings, then that is the need to help. That is the Buddhas.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.920
 When you read enlightenment in the Buddha, when you read enlightenment, those are called

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:34.360
 tukayas, Dharmakaya and Rupakaya. Dharmakaya is to one's own purpose or goal is completed.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:41.100
 One's own purpose or goal is completed that you got enlightened. Now purpose getting enlightenment

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:48.520
 is to benefit all sentient beings. That we are always jointed. By this merit, may I reach

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:54.300
 enlightenment. By that, may I can liberate all sentient beings. That's what we do pray

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:01.200
 all the time. And when we develop the bodhi jata, also I think, oh, with compassion, immense

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.140
 compassion for all sentient beings. I like to remove the suffering, the difficult troubles

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.480
 of all living beings. Therefore, I don't have the capability now to solve that. But therefore,

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:17.880
 I'm going to get enlightenment and then I'm going to help fully engage, benefit all beings

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.240
 to remove their suffering. So here, the same thing. I would say that then emanation is

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.800
 not restricted. Emanation is not restricted. As for example, in teaching, Dharmakaya is

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:39.320
 like sky and sambhokaya is like moonlight, full moonlight. And namakaya is the reflection

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.640
 of the moonlight. Wherever is needed, wherever the situation, the circumstances appeared,

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:52.320
 moon would refer like that place. Everywhere, without any effort, hardship, discrimination

00:01:52.320 --> 00:02:01.320
 ever been added and guiding, benefiting, helping to all sentient beings. That is the core

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.080
 fulfillment

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:10.240
 of the namakayas. And that namakaya is just one help. No, two, no, no numbers. And here

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:19.080
 I said billions, billions. And that would be too much. No, sentient beings are countless.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:27.040
 Emanation is a number we can call. So that means just the numbers are high. But everywhere,

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:34.960
 namakayas, all different varieties, that as we read, namakaya, the Supreme namakaya, art

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:43.380
 namakaya and variety namakayas. And then emanation or the birth namakayas. There's so many eman

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.960
ations

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:51.960
 as we read in the Buddha's teachings. So that emanated. And what is the purpose? May all

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:59.080
 the beings of the three realms. Again, desire realm, home realm, homeless realms. And that

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:08.080
 is the kind of like, condensate. If we make that little detail, then I said, the six realms.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:16.920
 Six realms is more kind of detailed of the three realms. And so otherwise both are same.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:28.960
 And the six realms are hell realms, hunger ghost realms, animal realms, human realms, and

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:39.240
 asura or the demigods realms, god realms. Those hell realms and hunger ghost realms, animal

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:51.200
 realms are known as three lord realms, lord. And this human, the demigod, or asura and

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:59.600
 god realm, three upper realms. Why it's called the upper and the lord? Because those three

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:07.640
 lord realms has more heavy garments, bad garments, heavy, heavy, loaded, bad garments. Because

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:14.640
 the result of that, they have, according to teaching, constantly troubled. There's no

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:22.400
 breaking form. There's no stop. It's just constantly. The moment you take the birth,

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:32.160
 until your karma is expired, there's continuation. Troubles, challenges, difficulties. And human

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:41.160
 realm, and god's realm. And even the asura realm, even their troubles, there is breaks.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:51.080
 Even we have breaks. For example, I highlighted those. Birth, getting old, sickness and death.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:58.080
 That's not happening all the time. Through one individual, for example. I was born, now

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:07.160
 that birth process had to go again. That is kind of completed. Now the old age and death,

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:13.800
 which is also not bad. For some of myself, I'm talking. So it's not that I'm pregnant

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:22.520
 with that. And death is not yet here. So there is space. There is a window of light. That's

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:29.600
 why, in the teaching, always use that window of light. This is now, in kind of like, so

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:35.800
 many clothes go everywhere, but there is really like bright sun light in the middle of the

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:44.080
 floor. It's shiny, golden, and even with Jacob's letter. Jacob's letter is just wonderful.

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:50.560
 That can open the community. This is not going to stay forever. So that's why I called three

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:57.560
 upper hands. But no matter whatever that, we all stay in samsara. Therefore, here is

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:04.560
 praise. Praise. And so, that everywhere everyone comes to this. And now...
