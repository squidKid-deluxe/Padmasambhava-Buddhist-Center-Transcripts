00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.600
 I had a question about certainty, wisdom, and the question is, how can we distinguish, like

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:15.680
 very clearly distinguish, the difference between certainty, wisdom, which teaching is so important

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.520
 in meditation, so we don't have doubts and hesitations come up in our meditation and

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.520
 lead us off track. So how to clearly distinguish between having certainty, wisdom, and having

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:33.740
 a really stubborn opinion that's so, that's very certain of itself, and then I guess another

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:39.340
 way to put it is, if you would talk a little bit about valid cognition, like how to know

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.360
 it's really valid cognition.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:58.160
 I mean, certain wisdom is definitely very important, but certain wisdom is, for example, for

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.720
 example, certain wisdom of the relative truth, and certain wisdom of the absolute truth, and

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:11.220
 certain wisdom of the relative truth is exactly as it is, you see, with

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:19.870
 what things are in the world, with your common sense, with your understanding, exactly as you see,

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.480
 then we don't have to be doubt.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:33.400
 So what the great master, Shanta Ratnath said in his teaching, what means the relative truth,

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:41.980
 because the relative truth also has two relative truths, one is called perfect relative truth and

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:48.090
 wrong relative truths, wrong relative truths, both are relative truths, but now we're talking of

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.180
 the

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.980
 part and relative truth. Part and relative truth is what the great master Shanta Ratnath said, that

00:01:53.980 --> 00:02:03.620
 everyone sees the same thing, from the scholar to the just unstarted person, everyone's ugly, the

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:14.380
 same thing, the same thing, and every, also as you see things as it is also performing that item,

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.320
 so whatever that is, performing

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:23.180
 exactly as your truth. So for example, I have used a roughly example, so if you see the prior, when

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:29.700
 you see the prior, scholars see the prior, it's prior, very educated, all that stuff, such as

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.500
 Einstein, Einstein, when you see the prior, he will say also it's prior, and I understand the

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:42.450
 person that living in small young ones, also when you see, it's prior, it's prior, so there's no

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.600
 really disagreement between that prior.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:52.040
 So that is called, commonly perceived by everyone, it's a common perceived. And then, what does it

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:59.460
 say? And then it performs the activities, that is the second call of the certainty wisdom, that

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:07.160
 prior, as everyone says the prior, but it does that activity of the prior, it's burning, heat, heat

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:13.830
, warmth, it has, or you don't have that, if it's not, then that prior, even everyone says the prior

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.040
 is not.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:22.600
 No, it's something different. So, performing the activity, exactly as it is. And then if you ever

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.400
 get analyzed that, according to the mother or according to the absolute level, then it's empty.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:34.810
 That is known as the part of the very truth, part of the very truth, symbol of the part of the very

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:35.400
 truth.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:42.370
 So when you see that, exactly as it is, exactly as it is, and that is called certainty wisdom,

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:48.180
 exactly. And then if you kind of doubt about that, you're pulling your own stomach, it's not really

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.400
, you're not going any, any pause, you're just going around and around.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:59.000
 So that is certainty wisdom. So that is all in the relative level. Absolute level that, when we're

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.290
 talking certainty wisdom, is for example, we're looking to the mind. Mind, without going to any

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.400
 place, mind is nature, it is emptiness.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:14.810
 And that is also, I mean, if you look to everyone, from the educated person to the uneducated

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:20.400
 person, if you see, where is mind? I don't think anybody has any answers.

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:27.920
 And even there's no answer there, but it's also coming, all this displays, thoughts, and all these

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:35.010
 thoughts coming. And then we look to more, more of those, whether it is a display or whether that

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:41.400
 mind is something, this is all, again, that's uncomfunded or enthusiastic.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:48.510
 So that, when you have that realization, I think that is really the, the certainty wisdom,

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:54.400
 certainty wisdom, and I think that is also as like, valid cognitions too.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:03.380
 And Ripche, could you then say also a little bit about, like, the difference between impure

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.400
 relative truth and the way noble beings see it, the pure relative truth?

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:24.980
 Yeah, that is an impure, impure, I mean, it's a part of the relative truth and the archipelago

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:25.220
 relative truth, archipelago relative truth, I think maybe, again, you like, know, is the, that is

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:30.400
 like, a reflection moon in the water, is the archipelago example of the archipelago relative truth.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:37.550
 It is the relative truth, it looks like moon, but it's not going to perform the activity as moon,

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:43.860
 moon's activities. So this is, and also a picture of the moon, or picture of the eye, whatever, it

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.400
 looks like that, but it's not going to perform activity.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:56.180
 So it's, those are all category, named as a wrong or the un, un-beneficial relative truth, to

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.400
 compare with the religious relative truth.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.400
 Yes, it's just examples in the philosopher's systems.

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:07.350
 Then, this is called pure relative truth and impure relative truth, impure relative truth, nature,

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:13.400
 impure relative truth and pure relative truth, nature is the same, there's no difference.

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:21.820
 All is illusion. All is despair. All, there's nothing really difference. But however, impure

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:24.400
 relative truth is what we see in this.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:33.600
 We see art is art, water as water, fire as fire, wind as wind. And impure relative truth is those,

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:38.400
 in light winds, seeing water is not earth. It's like human Buddha.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:46.910
 Pumul Buddha, Sanghyeh jhema, Sasanghyeh jhema, Choh mamak, water is mamaki, meh kul karmu, pai is

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:55.360
 kul karmu, long takse dromma, long wind, wind is takse drom, Pumul Buddha of the, of the, Pumul

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.400
 Buddha of the Amogra Siddhas.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:04.930
 And namkwa ska is bodhye rinsoh, meh geh dakwe chohri, those are the live and see. So this is

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:10.400
 relative truth, impure relative truth, I mean that is what really it is, all that see.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:17.520
 That was called pure relative truth. And reality, as I said, whether it's pure or impure, nature is

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:24.400
 the same. It's reflection, mon eva, it's not solitude and confident, all that.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.440
 >> Thank you, Mr. Chair.

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.500
 >> Okay, then we'll start with Mr.
