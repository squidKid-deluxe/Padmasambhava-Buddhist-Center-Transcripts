00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 You have to be more open heart. You are in appreciation, really, for greatness.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.670
 Then in the Buddha teaching, always said, in all the great Masters, "Have you gone as a human being

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:13.000
?"

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 It's so precious, so spiritual. Not just only that, we have 18 endowments.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 Those who are in this room, and as well as those who are on the line,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 we all have the 18 endowments, 18 lectures.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 Not every human being has that, but we have.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 You can list, look, and read those list of 18.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 Truly, we have all that 18 in text. We are well equipped of two activated good things.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 In ourself and for the others, really, every recommend that we have.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 Therefore, we enjoy and throw away with that.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 Today, we have the part of the teaching of the greatest teacher,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 Buddha Kya Kya Muni and Guru Pia Masumbha.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 Lineage of Masters, lineage of practitioners, care for this teaching, authentic teaching,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 stainless teaching, unspoiled teaching, undefiled and deluded teachings.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 The natural of the voting teachings, of the love, kindness, compassion, and the wisdom.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 That we can nourish ourselves. This love and compassion are versatile.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 And this kindness is nothing alien. This is our trait.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 When we activated and practiced the teaching, we glorified our goodness, our dignity.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 That's really it is.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 So therefore, practicing Dharma is win-win situation.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 Win now, win the future, win ourself, win others.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:03.040
 It's not

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:10.000
 peace, mellow, soothing, calming.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 That's what the teaching is.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 The greatest teacher, Buddha Kya Kya Muni teaching,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 and that's what all those great masters practiced.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 I often say those great, we call great masters.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 They're not just great masters, born with that.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 They all practiced and meditated.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 What they've taught Buddha, they practiced and meditated on the loving kindness,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 concave of both each other.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 That's what they've become.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 There will be honors in kind of reality, external level.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 They're humble, simple, drawn to the earth.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 They don't have the least intellectualist, the billionaires of the materials, all that.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 Many of them sitting in the hermitage, in the caves, on the mountains.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 But yet, they've become the glories of the old.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 Everyone is leading them.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 The golden mountains, in every direction.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 We all admire and we all praise their achievement.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 Where they are, or where they were, and where they've acted,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 and where they've taught, where they keep the legacy and the example taught to us.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 Those are all great masters.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 Really, that's what we need.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 Jewel and appreciation.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 Humble and assemble.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 Or practice.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 Not clapping the egos and kind of activating that.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 That's what, for that reason, the great master, his only union will say it in the teaching.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 There's four trails of the practice.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 Four trails, four wells.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 W-E-A-L-T-H, I believe.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 Four wells.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 First is, is, generally, everything kind of, not too much grasping, clinging to everything.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 Because everything is really going to change.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 There's nothing is going to last.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 So therefore, soft heart and soft mind, mind and soft thought, is one of the wealth.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 One of the wealth, soft heart, soft thought.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 And then, and all respect and appreciation.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 Second wealth is respect and appreciation among Sangha members, to each other.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 Your friends, your family, Sangha members, who is associated with directly that.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 Have fewer resurgence, all can find a nice port.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 That's the second.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 Third is, is, compassion for all beings of six realms, have been bodhijattva.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 For all living beings, that's heart rate.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 And the fourth treasure is devotion, confidence, pain in three duels, and lineage.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 With joy and appreciation.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 Those who are the great masters, he's holding to the union room and he says,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 those are the everlasting treasures of the practitioners.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 And we have that treasure in our heart and mind.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 Our practicing is going in quite good directions.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 Really good directions.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 We are going to be well equipped, we are going to be well equipped with the spiritual.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 So therefore, this is so important and so special for us.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 And it's together with that.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 That, and then, bodhijattva thought for all living beings.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 And that is already, you know, and I'm going to explain that.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 I'm not going to remind you that.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 And again he's going to talk that.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 So bodhijattva for all the same living beings.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 And then the third motivation is, this teaching, what we're going to discuss,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 is teaching of the vediyana.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 Vediyana teaching, as we discussed last night, oh yes, you know,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 everything is in the medalla of the divine.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 Everything is in the medallas.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 Not, vediyana teaching is not looking through the grasping perceptions,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 looking through the pure perception states.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 And behold, the pure perception states where things are.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 That means the pure perception state of the enlightened mind.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 Looking through the universe and all through the enlightened mind.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
 The enlightened mind of the Buddha mind will look.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 All is enlightened.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 So that's what the reality is.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 Everything is enlightened and apart from the states.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 So though I'm known as three various states, of course,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 called vediyana, vedaira form, vedaira song, vedaira speech.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 That, why called vediyana?

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 Because that, this realization of that pure form, song,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 the spirit cannot be deluded by the dualities.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 Whether duality, ignorance, understand that not is not going to change anything.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 Reality, nature is reality.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 Nothing can change.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 For that reason is called vedaira or the indestructible.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 Indestructible by, indestructible by the duality and the graspings.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 So that, have that realization, those thoughts, intentions.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000
 Strongly that, with this, then we go to the sadhana of the medyukin, that.
