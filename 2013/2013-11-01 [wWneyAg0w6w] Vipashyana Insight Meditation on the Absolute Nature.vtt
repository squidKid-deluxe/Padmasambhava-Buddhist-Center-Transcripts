00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.360
 "For that reason," he said, "behind." "But otherwise, absolute truth, relative truths are insepar

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:13.000
able. There is no separations at all, absolute truth."

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 "How is that relative truth?" "Absolute truth is," and we started many times, and you heard this,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 and I heard you heard that.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.990
 "This absolute truth is," the great Master of the generation, what it says, "is beyond the

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.000
 conservatives."

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 "Beyond the conservatives, it is free from all the complexities, and it is so peaceful."

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:51.380
 "There is no purpose, it is total peace, total one even, if I use the word even, total even status

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:52.000
."

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 "It is not going to be seen by this duality mind in it." "That's why we don't see." "But it is

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 going to be seen by your own eye, your own eye of intelligence."

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.470
 "Intelligence and the wisdom are, you are going to see that." "That is the nature of this

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.000
 everything," what this great Master said.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 "See, this is the absolute truth." "That is the absolute truth."

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.600
 "When we realize that nature, exactly as it is, merging our intelligence with that nature, insepar

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:41.000
able without any divisions, and that is known as then, a Vipassana, meditation."

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 "Relancing that name, merge status, exactly as in that status, status, status."

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:57.540
 "And then, what do you bring? All the realization, true nature, calm and peaceful, that everything

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.000
 kind of burns down, and all that will shine one after another."

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 "And that is, therefore, this is, are you able to do these practices?"

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 "Yes." "And now, again, that's this great Master."

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 "Have you ever realized this nature?" "Natural, and be in that status."

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 "If you can keep up that practice, have realized it, and that's what the great Master said."

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:53.800
 "There is nothing better realization, or better than anything in this world." "There is nothing

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.000
 better, and better than that."

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:07.980
 "That will remove, or pacify, and transcend that, or release all our obstacles, and all the suffer

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:17.000
ings, all the difficulties, and all the troubles, and that is, it will immediately release."

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 "Because this is understanding of the absolute nature, it will release." "What it will release?"

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 "It will remove, instantly, the grasping, clinging, according to this of our realization."

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.020
 "Those grasping, what was in teaching said, those are the grasping of the individualist, grasping

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.000
 to the phenomenal existence."

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 "That will release, according to that." "And that again, great Masters, what is it?"

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 "Again, in his teachings, this great Master, Nagarjuna said, in the garland of the jewel."

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:05.560
 "The jewel, whatever, garland of the jewels." "And he said, as long as you grasping to the five

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:15.470
 aggregate, with as eagle, or five aggregate, that long we will have, or that individually, well

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.000
 have the emoji and the garments."

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 "As long as we grasping to the aggregates, that long, that individually, have the ego clinging."

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:40.840
 "As long as ego clinging, that long you have the emotions, and the activities, or the result, the

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.000
 consequence, as scars."

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:52.940
 "And as long as karma and kicking up the karma and emotion continually maintain, that long the sams

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.000
ara is continuous, that long samsara."

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:04.280
 "That means samsara means troubles, difficulties, uncomfortable troubles, unsatisfied violence,

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.000
 that will continue."

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:13.060
 "So that means a real understanding of the absolute nature." "Nature and the brain that relaxes." "

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:19.000
Practice, as the Vibhacham and the Chama, inseparably, as together, putting that direction."

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 "What are you going to do?" "It will release, gradually, according to our practice of meditation."

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 "The grasping." And the teaching said, "What? Always the great 20-part hero used to say that."

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.190
 "First, according to the teaching, according to Jain and Mahayana we can understand, positive will

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:42.000
 reduce the grasping of the ego gradually."

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 "And say, ego's kind of like is immediately easy to deal, in a way. It is highlighted among that."

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 "And then second, gradually, well, till then, the general classmates, greatly different."

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.100
 "So once the ego is developed, as Navardhana said here, and as all the great masters you say, I

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.000
 mean all the schools are very Buddhism."

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 "You say, as soon, as long as you have the realization of the egolessness, the karma is finished."

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
 "That means that emotions are gross emotions of pleasure."

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 "Gross emotions are gone and karma is gone."

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 "Because of that, for example, what reference you said?"

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 "Arhata was not totally enlightened beings, or as Buddhas."

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 "But however, they defeated the ego."

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 "They defeated the ego, therefore, they become the pre from the samsara."

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 "So that means free from the karma, free from the circles."

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 "Circle existent things."

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 "They are free from that circle existent things."

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 "Because they defeated the ego."

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.830
 "As the great master said here, as long as you grasp into the aggregate, that long you have the ego

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:09.000
 cleanings."

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 "As long as you have the ego cleanings, that long you have the emotion in the karma."

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 "As long as you have the karma in the emotion, there is continuation of the samsara."

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 "It's ongoing."

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000
 "We can't stop samsara because cause and conduct are perfectly intact."

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 "Again, of course, it's interdependent all that."

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 "Therefore, it will not stop."

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:41.380
 "But cause or fundamental cause of the samsara and difficulty troubles is the grasp of clinging to

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:43.000
 the individuals."

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
 "Which is known as grasp, or which is known as ego cleanings."

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 "That is the one."

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 "And with this understanding, again, in the Dzokhi meditation, what we do?"

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 "We do not know immediately, Kannada, as the ego, or this and that, this."

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 "But we relax in the natural state."

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 "We combine about Kannada, Vibhana, or the Dzokhi token in several levels."

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:14.000
 "So therefore, we deal in the deep, not just the kind of like, this kind of like..."

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 "This, this locator, this locator in the ego itself."

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 "You can, we deal with all the tokens in subcontainers."

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000
 "That is also not externally moving with that, but in the Dzokhi teaching."

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 "You are immediately going to the right source of self in the mind."

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 "And relaxing in there, and within the mental state."

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 "We in the hell that deal with us and then, both the attachment."

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 "Both graspings."

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:47.000
 "Clear graspings of the ego, and graspings of the phenomena that instantly exist."

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 "And eliminated, Dzokhi teaching, as great Kettipati Hirabudu said."

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
 "And when a great master made it, all the same, same said."

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:05.000
 "That moment, therefore Dzokhi teaching, the Vaidyana teaching is so swift, so exotic."

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 "It goes to the target, not going to the branches."

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 "It goes directly there."

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000
 "So either way, of course, this is more teachings on the Mahayana systems."

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000
 "So therefore, with this understanding, have you meditated?"

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000
 "Any meditating that establishes you, or resists you, such as meditating."

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 "With beautiful postures, beautiful intentions, beautiful thought."

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
 "Those beautiful and long second thoughts."

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 "You, in the devotion, in the body together."

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 "Bring up those simple inequality in the heart of the mind."

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
 "Let's settle ourselves."

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 "We are not going to become as a Gypsy all the time."

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.000
 "Running, running, trying."

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 "Really, when you have time, when you have space, we should use the target."

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 "We are not just going to kind of wander off and try to do this and that thing."

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 "Try to, I mean, of course, we have to take care of the samsara."

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
 "Activating our, take care of that."

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 "But also, same time, try to spend some time to practice."

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
 "The meditate is something that makes meaning for our lives."

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 "Very rewarded to ourself, and something that also goes with that, according to the teachings."

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 "This samsara, you can activate it, whatever we do."

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
 "No matter how much rich, how much powerful, how much things we have."

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
 "All lived behind."

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 "Nothing really will fall there with us."

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000
 "But something that we develop mentally, something that with mind."

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
 "Mind is traveling with us."

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
 "Mind goes with us."

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
 "So therefore, whatever we develop, we do something with this, our mind."

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 "Mind, that is, will make a difference."

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 "By the political court, this time talking, we could use such as very dirty."

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 "Love and compare, kindness, joy, and then relax, bring more devotion."

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:58.000
 "That means, devotion is not just one way directly that, but devotion means joy and everything."

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 "Respect with the richness, richness that is surrounded."

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
 "Surrounded and settle ourselves."

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
 "Settle, we have to settle."

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 "I mean, the Buddha teaching, what do you call it?"

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 "Samsara's Seno name is wondrous."

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 "Truly we are wondrous."

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
 "But at least where do we have the opportunity?"

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 "Where do we have the capabilities?"

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 "Where do every situation and circumstance in our own hand?"

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
 "We try to settle, make the difference."

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
 "According to Buddha teaching, nobody is going to make a difference from our side to ours."

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 "We are going to stop."

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
 "We are to pass the jump."

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 "Have to jump."

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 "Jump, and then support will come."

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 "Help will come."

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 "That is what is this."

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:48.000
 So therefore, this is the absolute, brilliant meaning of that.
