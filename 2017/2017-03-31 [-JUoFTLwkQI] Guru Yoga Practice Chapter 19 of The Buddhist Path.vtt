NOTE     "synopsis": "Main Topics Being Discussed\n \n1. \"All of the Buddha's teachings are like stairsteps leading to Dzogchen, the Great Perfection, which is the summit of the Vajrayana. The key that opens the door to Dzogchen is the practice of guru yoga. If you want to practice Dzogchen, you should first practice on Guru Padmasambhava, and then you will easily understand the Dzogchen teachings. When you supplicate Guru Padmasambhava with a clear and peaceful mind, filled with devotion and bodhichitta, then his blessings and those of all the buddhas and bodhisattvas will help you to realize the true nature of your mind. For people who want to do Vajrayana meditation it is very important to practice Guru Yoga.\n Guru Padmasambhava represents the Three Jewels and the Three Roots\u2014all of the objects of refuge. When you meditate on him you are not ignoring the other realized beings, because he embodies all of the buddhas of the ten directions and the three times. In particular, he represents your personal teachers and all of the masters of the Nyingma and Kagyu lineages. It is not necessary to visualize all the different buddhas; doing Guru Yoga and practicing on one buddha is enough to bring full enlightenment.\" (pg 93, 1st and 2nd paragraph)\n\n2. \"There are many ways to meditate, but no matter which technique you use, you need to apply concentration. This involves keeping the mind on the object of focus. ... Also, during meditation you need to apply mindfulness, to watch what your mind is doing, as a support for your concentration. This is the basic instruction for beginning your daily practice.\n When you do Vajrayana practice it is very important to establish a personal connection with a lama and with Guru Padmasambhava. By connecting with Guru Padmasambhava you receive his assistance in understanding the true nature of the mind. Doing Guru Yoga practice also brings a very close connection to your personal teacher, who exemplifies the realization gained by the practice. When you connect with a personal teacher, you have an auspicious situation similar to that of Guru Padmasambhava's twenty-five disciples, all of whom became enlightened by following the instructions of their teacher.\" (pg 96 last two paragraphs)\n\n\nImportant Concepts and Terms\n\nroot guru [Skt.; Tib. rtsa ba'i bla ma]. In general, the term \"root guru\" can refer to two kinds of spiritual teachers: (1) the principal or first spiritual teacher from whom one has received empowerments, transmissions, or pith instructions, and (2) the teacher who has introduced one to the nature of mind. For a practitioner of the Vajrayana, one's root guru is considered to be even more precious than the Buddha himself, because it is through his or her direct blessings that a practitioner attains realization. It is often said that one's root guru is the perfect embodiment of the Three Jewels: the mind of the guru is the Buddha, the speech of the guru is the Dharma, and the body of the guru is the Sangha. The Awakened One, Buddha Shakymuni himself said, \"All the one thousand buddhas of this Fortunate Aeon attained enlightenment by contacting a qualified teacher.\" Therefore, practitioners should constantly mingle their minds with the wisdom mind of the guru and pray to him or her with one-pointed devotion. (Ceaseless Echoes of the Great Silence, pg 192-3)\n\ndevotion [Tib. dad pa; Skt. bhakthi]. Devotion is the root of all accomplishment, and practice of the Vajrayana is impossible without it. The three stages of devotion are (1) \"initial, interested devotion\" [dang ba'i dad pa], (2) \"devotion of intense longing\" ['dod pa'i dad pa], and (3) \"final devotion of unshakable certainty\" [phyir mi ldog pa'i dad pa]. A variation of these three types of devotion or faith is described by Longchenpa: \"Generally, three types of faith are discussed in the scholastic tradition: lucid faith, desirous faith, and the faith of conviction. (1) The first entails a lucid frame of mind that arises in reference to the Three Jewels.\" (2) The second concerns the desire to take up the Three Jewels very closely in the heart and develop a clear sense of the four renunciation thoughts. And (3) \"the third involve[s] having conviction in the principle of karmic causality.\" (Liberating Duality with Wisdom Display: The Eight Emanations of Guru Padmasambhava, pg 157)\n\n\nPBC YouTube Videos of the Venerable Khenpo Rinpoches for Further Study \n \nThe Essence of Guru Yoga\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQuyDDhVQg8\n\nOn April 4, 2011, Venerable Khenpo Rinpoche taught how the essence of Guru Yoga is your devotion and confidence in the lineage and the teaching. With devotion, we are spiritually settled, and growth will come. Guru Yoga brings together all of the buddhas, bodhisattvas, and great masters into Guru Padmasambhava, feeling a closeness, confidence, and trust in him as the source of all blessings and spiritual realization.\n\nFor more information on the PBC Morning Dawn Study Program:\nmorningdawn@padmasambhava.org",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 Welcome, this is the PBC Morning Dawn Study Group webcast from Padmasamy Ling, the Venerable

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.840
 Kemperumache's Monastery and Retreat Center in New York. Today we're discussing their

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.840
 book, "The Buddhist Path, Chapter 19," which is entitled "Guru Yoga." So we'll begin with

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.240
 our usual opening and lineage prayers, and then we'll go into this discussion. Thanks

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.080
 so much for joining us.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:46.040
 "Guru Yoga, Chapter 20," which is entitled "Guru Yoga, Chapter 20," which is entitled

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:55.400
 "Guru Yoga, Chapter 20," which is entitled "Guru Yoga, Chapter 20," which is entitled

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:02.160
 "Guru Yoga, Chapter 20," which is entitled "Guru Yoga, Chapter 20," which is entitled

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.000
 "Guru Yoga, Chapter 20," which is entitled "Guru Yoga, Chapter 20," which is entitled

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.800
 "Guru Yoga, Chapter 20," which is entitled "Guru Yoga, Chapter 20," which is entitled

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.840
 "Guru Yoga, Chapter 20," which is entitled "Guru Yoga, Chapter 20," which is entitled

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.200
 "Guru Yoga, Chapter 20," which is entitled "Guru Yoga, Chapter 20," which is entitled

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.800
 "I Pray at Your Lotus Feet." In the palace of the old men, Dharma Daptu, the essence of

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.200
 all the bullets of the three times, the one who shows clearly the dharmakaya of my own

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:42.000
 mind, we pray to the honor of Allward Guru, LourÃ©is through teacher, precious one, dwelling

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.200
 on the lotus seed on the crown of my head. Hold me with your great kindness and bestow

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.200
 the accomplishments of body, speech, and mind.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.200
 [Music]

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:05.200
 [Music]

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:15.200
 [Music]

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:23.200
 [Music]

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:31.200
 [Music]

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.200
 So Chapter 19, "Guru Yoga" begins on page 93, "The Buddha's Path," and I'll do a

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.200
 summary of this chapter and then we'll go into the main point. So the Venerable

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.200
 Guru Rinpoche's begin by saying, "All the teachings of the Buddha lead to Dzogchen,"

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:51.200
 which is the pinnacle of Atriana, and that key that opens the door to Dzogchen is

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.200
 "Guru Yoga." You should meditate on Guru Padmasambhava with a peaceful mind filled

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.200
 with devotion and bodhicitta, and by receiving His blessings, it will help you to realize

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.200
 the true nature of your own mind. This day, Guru Rinpoche completely embodies all the

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.200
 three jewels and three roots, all the Buddhas and bodhisattvas, all the lineage masters,

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.200
 including your own personal teachers. Doing Guru Yoga and practicing on one Buddha like

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.200
 Guru Rinpoche is enough to achieve full enlightenment. All of the Buddhas we

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:24.200
 visualize are both real Buddhas, as well as displays of our own mind. Practicing

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.200
 wholeheartedly on one Buddha you feel a strong connection to will be enough for you

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.200
 to achieve enlightenment. Rinpoche describes a simple yet complete way to meditate on

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.200
 Guru Rinpoche. First, recite the Seven Line Prayer and then recite the Vajra Guru Mantra.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.200
 To do this, they say to do the same preparations for any sitting practice. First,

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.200
 do three prostrations and sit with good posture. Do breath purification three times.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.200
 Then visualize Guru Rinpoche in the sky in front of you, as it's described in the chapter.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.200
 Guru Rinpoche is made of a wisdom rainbow light and is not made of flesh and bone.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.200
 Take refuge and arouse bodhicitta to free all beings from suffering. Then

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.200
 recite the Seven Line Prayer at least three or seven times. They say this prayer is the

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.200
 voice of the true nature that spontaneously arose when Guru Rinpoche was miraculously

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.200
 born. The twelve syllables of the Vajra Guru Mantra balance and purify the internal

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.200
 and external aspects of our existence, including the twelve links of interdependent

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:26.200
 origination. Even one recitation of the Vajra Guru Mantra has great benefit.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.200
 Recite this mantra for as long as you have time. If you are in a hurry to see Guru Rinpoche,

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:36.200
 recite the mantra more. You can recite 21 times, 108 times, 10 malas, 100 malas,

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:41.200
 a million malas, a billion malas. Whatever you have time for, with the aim of

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.200
 completing at least 100,000 recitations. They say the sound of the mantra is

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:52.200
 profound meditation. When you concentrate on the sound with devotion, bodhicitta,

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.200
 while recognizing the emptiness nature of yourself in all forms, sounds and awareness.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:02.200
 This is the union of shamatha and vipassana, or the union of creation and completion stages,

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.200
 which purifies all inner and outer forms, sounds and movements of mind.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:11.200
 After reciting the mantra, receive the blessings from Guru Rinpoche as instructed in the book,

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:16.200
 and sincerely believe that all the impurities of your body, speech and mind are completely

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:21.200
 removed, and you have fully received Guru Rinpoche's blessings.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.200
 Next, Guru Rinpoche dissolves into white light, which merges into your crown chakra

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:30.200
 and heart center, filling your body with wisdom light. Your body is no longer

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:35.200
 solid, but is made of pure rainbow light. Your awareness is entirely and separately

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:40.200
 merged with the wisdom mind of Guru Rinpoche and all the Buddhas. Rest in this

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:45.200
 wisdom awareness without being distracted by thoughts for as long as you have time.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:50.200
 Conclude by dedicating the merit of your practice for the benefit of all sentient beings.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:03.200
 The first main topic is on page 93, first and second paragraphs.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:08.200
 All of the Buddha's teachings are like stair steps leading to Zochen,

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.200
 the great perfection, which is the summit of the Vajrayana.

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:17.200
 The key that opens the door to Zochen is the practice of Guru Yoga.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:22.200
 If you want to practice Zochen, you should first practice on Guru Pama Sambala,

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:26.200
 and then you will easily understand the Zochen teachings.

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:30.200
 When you supplicate Guru Pama Sambala with a clear and peaceful mind,

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:35.200
 filled with devotion and bodhicitta, then its blessings and those of all the

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:40.200
 Buddhas and bodhisattvas will help you to realize the true nature of your mind.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:46.200
 For people who want to do Vajrayana meditation, it is very important to practice Guru Yoga.

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:53.200
 Guru Pama Sambala represents the three jewels and the three roots, all the objects of refuge.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:58.200
 When you meditate on him, you are not ignoring the other realized beings,

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:03.200
 because he embodies all of the Buddhas of the ten directions and the three times.

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:09.790
 In particular, he represents your personal teachers and all of the masters of the Nima and Cagulain

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:10.200
ages.

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:14.200
 It is not necessary to visualize all the different Buddhas.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:20.200
 Doing Guru Yoga and practicing on one Buddha is enough to bring full enlightenment.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:33.200
 I have a question. I just thought maybe to talk a little bit about, like in the second sentence,

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:37.200
 the key that opens the door to Zochen is the practice of Guru Yoga.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:42.200
 And maybe just to kind of talk about, like, how is that and why is that,

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:50.200
 that Guru Yoga is really like the essential practice for the highest of the path, Zochen.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.200
 Anyone have any thoughts about that?

00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:01.200
 I wonder if it relates back to really feeling that closeness with the teacher,

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:06.200
 particularly if you're fortunate, where you're able to have a connection to a teacher

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:10.200
 and you're able to connect to that wisdom mind and recognizing how they're really the emanation

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:15.940
 of all the beautiful qualities and all that beautiful potential, really, of this precious human

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:16.200
 life,

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:20.200
 but also, you know, the nature of the mind, all of those beautiful qualities,

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:23.200
 really reflecting on that feeling, that closeness, and then, you know,

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:27.200
 having that connection and that desire to just mirror all of those qualities,

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:32.200
 seeing them in yourself and really connecting down to that, to that pith understanding,

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:36.200
 you know, what else do you want, you know?

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:40.200
 But I don't know what anyone else thinks.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:48.200
 I want to say I just had one thought, which is just that, like, these are lineage teachings, too,

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:55.200
 that come from, like, thousands of years of realized beings who practice that,

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:59.200
 engage in the teachings, and Guru Padmasabhava is a living Buddha, like we said,

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:03.200
 in the last, like we saw in the last chapter,

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:10.200
 a living Buddha who continuously manifests and emanates in peers and visions or in actuality,

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:16.200
 and so, like, repertures often say that the lineage, bless me, is like the...

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:23.010
 lineage is like a power line, and the lineage blessings the electricity that goes through the power

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:23.200
 line,

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:28.200
 so when you connect to that, I guess, with the proper motivation,

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:34.200
 then you're not just making, you know, we're not just making something up,

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:38.200
 just coming out of the blue, but it's just like a...

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:41.200
 And then, like, what Loger was saying, too, because the...

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:47.200
 Well, devotion is so essential, you know, like repertures always say.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:53.200
 Devotion is like the most profound practice, you know, as far as you connect with that,

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:57.200
 in case your mind is really so close to the natural state.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:03.200
 Even if you didn't recognize the natural state, but that quality of openness and love

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:13.850
 and appreciation and joy and gratitude and this courage and commitment is the essence of the whole

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:14.200
 path.

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:21.200
 Yeah, I was thinking, too, about how, you know, what Guru Yoga is, is merging with the Guru's mind.

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:28.640
 And so that's... so the Guru is like a... a link, you know, that in terms of what that realized

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.200
 mind is,

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:34.200
 then you start to be able to kind of recognize that because you see it in your teacher,

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:42.200
 and so then there's some connection there in terms of starting to experience it within yourself.

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:47.200
 Yeah, it was kind of similar to what Loger was saying about the mirroring that happens,

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:52.200
 you know, because of recognizing something, it's almost like you can't recognize something

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:58.200
 without at least seeing a little bit in yourself, and there's this really beautiful kind of...

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:06.200
 it's a beautiful process, I think, a little bit, a little bit kind of glimpsing, glimpsing, you

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:06.200
 know.

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:26.200
 It's a very profound... it is kind of speechless, in a way, it's kind of speechless.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:33.200
 I mean, I think Abido, I mean, just more son of a thing, comes to mind.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:38.200
 Like, as long as we're not realized beings, then we're holding onto things,

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:42.200
 then we're grasping onto something, because we're in grasping mind.

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:49.600
 So, in that case, in we're in grasping mind, then the best thing we can possibly grasp onto is an

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.200
 enlightened being.

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:55.460
 Because everything an enlightened being is going to do for us is going to be for our benefit and

00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:57.200
 everyone's benefit.

00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:03.750
 So it's, I mean, it's very clear in terms of taking refuge, like the Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, and

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:05.200
 the three roots,

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:11.200
 and I mean, the Lama, or these great wisdom beings, like really fully embody these qualities,

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.200
 like the Rummusche, of course.

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:20.550
 And if we're going to rely on something, then that's the most direct way to manifest those

00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:21.200
 qualities ourselves,

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:24.200
 or to see them in ourselves, at least.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:28.200
 So then we directly are connecting with, and I mean, this has so much to do with sincerity,

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:37.630
 and really seeing those beautiful qualities, and also renouncing, or being larger than the small

00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:38.200
 narrow ways,

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:44.420
 we can also be, to really renounce these more narrow ways of our mind, and all this doubt and

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:45.200
 hesitation,

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:51.720
 and just really kind of having full confidence to lean into the, that it's possible there are these

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:52.200
 wisdom beings,

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:57.200
 and we have that in ourselves too, and please come help me realize that.

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:02.200
 And then in the end, I mean, it's, of course, that we're not relying on an external being.

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:08.200
 I mean, that's very clear in the teachings, like emptiness from Sutra Mahayana up, I think,

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:12.200
 that, but as long as we need to rely on things, because our mind is holding things,

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:17.420
 then that's the best thing we can rely on, and in the end, like, that we're not needing to rely on

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:18.200
 anything.

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:24.200
 I mean, the Buddhas don't, because there's not anything out there, there's not anything in here.

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:27.200
 It's just your awareness or something.

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:31.200
 But so it's like, seems like a very direct way to do that, and it seems infallible,

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:35.200
 in the sense of, if you're really connecting with a Buddha, an enlightened master,

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:38.200
 that's all that they can do, is help all beings.

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:44.200
 I mean, that's, there's nothing blocking them, their nature, from doing that.

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:48.790
 And then to really leap over that division we have between ourselves being separate from all of

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:49.200
 this,

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:54.200
 from everything, there's a separation, and just to mingle, like Ann said,

00:13:54.200 --> 00:14:10.200
 to really have mind, merge with mind as best we can here for a moment.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:15.200
 I remember reading, well, it was one of Dilbo Kansai's books,

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:17.200
 and I think it was "Which Fulfilling Jewel?"

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:20.200
 I just remember it was a whole book on Guru Yoga,

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:25.200
 and I remember I was reading it kind of early in my studies to Buddhists,

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:30.980
 and it just, it seems so fascinating how he, particularly the way Dilbo Kansai was treating Guru

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:31.200
 Yoga,

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:35.200
 it wasn't, you know, just something on the cushion,

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:41.200
 it was talking about Guru Yoga becoming this part of your daily life,

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:45.200
 where if you're walking uphill, you're visualizing your teacher above your head,

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:48.200
 while you're also making the aspiration,

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:54.200
 "May I carry all sentient beings from the hell realms to liberation?"

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:59.200
 Or if you're going downhill, "May I go to the hell realms to liberate all sentient beings?"

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:03.200
 You know, open a door, "May I open the door to liberation?"

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:08.200
 And viewing every part of your daily activity with the Guru Yoga,

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:11.200
 but also tying it into the real essence of Guru Yoga,

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:14.200
 really tapping into the aspirations, those good qualities,

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:18.200
 really making your heart tender about all of those things.

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:23.200
 I really thought it was really something beautiful, particularly,

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:27.200
 because I think with all the things we've been discussing here,

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:31.200
 I mean, of course it's not things that, it's just for the cushion,

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:34.200
 or for the meditation, or anything like that.

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:40.200
 Where does it make your heart tender in everything you do?

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:44.200
 And of course with Guru Yoga, those who have practiced it enough,

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:46.200
 of course it doesn't seem like that much of a difference,

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:53.200
 because they get it, they understand that that blessing just carries into everything,

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:58.200
 in that sense of, you know, it's always there, nature of mind's always there,

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:00.200
 all these beautiful qualities are always there.

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:06.200
 But, you know, for those of us who are still stubborn,

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:10.200
 you know, it is good to have those little reminders to carry through the day.

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:12.200
 I thought it was really beautiful.

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:15.200
 Of course it was very helpful that it's such a long walk to get to the mail,

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:19.200
 so that gives me a lot of time to practice going to the hell realms in the back.

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:27.200
 [laughter]

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:31.200
 I think one of the things about Guru Yoga that's really striking is that,

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:34.200
 I mean, at least, I think we can all say this,

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:38.200
 when we're actually in a state of mind that's actually devoted,

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:45.200
 that's inspired, that's like so kind of, just like freshly engaged with the teachings,

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:51.200
 like this preciousness of the opportunity, and how amazing it is that these great beings,

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:54.200
 these teachers, that we've received these teachings,

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:56.200
 and they help us with so many things,

00:16:56.200 --> 00:17:00.200
 and they're just relentlessly available and so compassionate,

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:04.200
 like when we're actually in, that's even a moment of mind,

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:09.200
 it's just so clear, like how beneficial that is to the practice,

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:14.200
 like how it becomes real, like that impermanence becomes,

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:17.200
 you don't want to waste time, this is so special,

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:25.200
 or it just all becomes self-evident when that devotion is really strong in that moment.

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:30.200
 And you can see, I mean, at least, it's just how it just all kind of clicks,

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:34.200
 even if you're just devoted for, you know, you read some inspiring thing

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:37.200
 and you're devoted for a minute or five minutes, it's just,

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:42.200
 the Dharma just makes more sense, I mean, all the things that block us,

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:47.200
 and we think we're so bad, or so lazy, or we're so great, and we don't need it,

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:51.200
 or just all the ways we can kind of go around the point,

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:58.200
 that in that moment of actually being devoted, that it's just really so strong,

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:02.200
 and then here's like the practice where that's what we're trying to do all the time,

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:08.200
 is just being this totally inspired, vulnerable, like welcoming, receptive state

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:13.200
 to the blessings and to our own, like, nature being there.

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:17.200
 So while I think there's a lot of technical things we can say about it too,

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:20.200
 I think it's also like really obvious if we're just in,

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:25.200
 like when we're in that devoted awareness, it's just, it works,

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:31.200
 like the practice is not a burden, it's like, I want to do this so much, you know,

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:34.200
 until we get all caught in something, and then whatever,

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:41.200
 we get caught and we need to do practice again.

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:46.200
 Yeah, and when you think of everything that we've gone through in samsara,

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:52.200
 even just in this lifetime, you know, and how much benefit have we gotten

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:59.200
 from normal mundane activities, and how have we come out of suffering

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:07.200
 and realized that our nature is enlightened? Not that much.

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:11.200
 Maybe, I mean, you know, it's like not too much, but when you need a teacher,

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:17.200
 like, that really embodies, that is the dharma, you know,

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:23.200
 like Absolute Guru Pama Samhava, they embody that quality,

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.200
 and you actually make a connection, if you think about it,

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:30.200
 in the whole vastness of all our lifetimes, and even in this one,

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:36.200
 finally we're connecting with someone who embodies, who really gets it,

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:40.200
 you know, and is totally dedicated to benefiting others.

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:44.200
 That's the only thing they want to do, because that's their whole, you know,

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:49.200
 fully actualized their nature, and you see them just selflessly, you know,

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:52.200
 like day in and day out, like totally benefiting beings,

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:56.200
 and that's their greatest wish and intention, and like you make a connection

00:19:56.200 --> 00:20:00.200
 with somebody who is the teachings, and they are Pama Samhava, you know,

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:05.200
 from, on the absolute level, they are, they totally recognize that nature,

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:11.200
 and they're just, what they most want is for you to recognize that.

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:16.200
 Your mind, their mind are the same, and Pama, Guru Pama Samhava's mind is the same.

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:20.200
 It's just like a total beacon of light that just cuts through everything,

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:23.200
 you know, of the whole darkness of all these struggles

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:26.200
 of trying to make things work that are never going to work, you know,

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:31.200
 and trying to like, I mean, not to, it's just like, it's a total, like,

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:33.200
 you want to lottery, you know.

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:37.200
 If you make contact with a qualified teacher, and come in contact with the teachings,

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:41.200
 the teachings always say, it's like going to the island of wish-fulfilling jewels,

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:46.200
 and you have everything that you've ever wanted right in your hand, you know.

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:53.200
 They say, if you don't achieve enlightenment based on that, you know,

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:56.200
 then what sense does that make it all, you know?

00:20:56.200 --> 00:21:01.200
 It's just beautiful, you know, when you think about it.

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:04.200
 It's like you totally, your samsara is ending for you.

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:07.200
 When you meet a qualified teacher, when you hear the teaching,

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:09.200
 you hear the dharma that they embody,

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:13.200
 and they're passed on this line of wisdom, realization, you know.

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:17.200
 It's literally like, for you, samsara is like, at the very end, you know.

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:19.200
 I mean, we should see it that way, you know.

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:22.200
 I mean, if we do approach it that way, then it's like,

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:27.200
 there's nothing standing in our way, because all the obstacles are totally dispelled

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:32.200
 by connecting with that teacher, like through guru yoga, you said, too.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:36.200
 And even if your life is cut short, and even if you die tomorrow, you know,

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:38.200
 then who cares, you know.

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:42.200
 If you are in that, if you are doing that, you know,

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:45.200
 you're connecting with that, and your life is meaningful, you know.

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:48.200
 You're making it meaningful in that moment.

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:59.200
 Then what more could you do, you know?

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:02.200
 I think it's also beautiful, too, especially in Vashriyana,

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:05.200
 that, I mean, it was just that, the possibility of achieving enlightenment

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:07.200
 in a single lifetime.

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:11.200
 And if we think about how much karma we have that has to be purified

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:15.200
 in order for that to be possible, that there's definitely going to be

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:18.200
 a lot of karma that's going to come up in that lifetime,

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:20.200
 that's going to have to be worked with or dealt with

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:24.200
 in a way where we don't continue that karma.

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:28.200
 So here we have a method that, like, can just blaze through

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:32.200
 or just really go through all these turbulent things

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:36.200
 that have to come up in order to become enlightened in a single lifetime.

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:39.200
 I mean, in order to do it in any kind of a short time,

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:44.200
 there's just these obstacles, hindrances, crises, imbalances,

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:47.200
 like, all those karma things.

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:51.200
 Here we have a method, like, the way of most directly going to

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:55.200
 how we can best deal with all those situations, even the good times.

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:59.200
 Like, it is to recognize our nature that these things are just

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:03.200
 movements of our nature and to stay grounded in that.

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:06.200
 And then, hiragiri-yoga, that's what it's all about.

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:09.200
 So it becomes the essence of all of these practices,

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:11.200
 of all the other nundra practices.

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:13.200
 And, like, they all really begin with that,

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:16.200
 like, seeing that, recognizing that nature.

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:27.200
 And so it's kind of powerful, it's indirect.

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:34.200
 So I'll go to the next, we'll do the next summary in the next question.

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:36.200
 Kamurumache is continued by saying,

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:40.200
 "There are many ways to meditate and they all require concentration.

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:44.200
 In this practice, you can concentrate on each syllable circling clockwise,

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:48.200
 which will transform your ordinary speech into Vajra speech.

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:50.200
 You also need to apply mindfulness,

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:53.200
 which means you're aware of what your mind is doing.

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:56.200
 In Vajrayana practice, it's very important to establish

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:58.200
 and grow a personal connection with your lama

00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:00.200
 in Guru Padmasambhava.

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:03.200
 Gurumache will help you realize the nature of your mind

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:08.200
 and your lama exemplifies the realization gained by the practice.

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:10.200
 When you connect with your teacher,

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:13.200
 you have an auspicious situation,

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:18.200
 similar to that of being directly receiving teachings from Gurumache.

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:28.200
 That's one of his disciples.

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:32.200
 This comes from page 96, the last two paragraphs.

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:35.200
 There are many ways to meditate, but no matter which technique you use,

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:37.200
 you need to apply concentration.

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:40.200
 This involves keeping the mind on the object of focus.

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:44.200
 Also, during meditation, you need to apply mindfulness

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:48.200
 to watch what your mind is doing as a support for your concentration.

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:53.200
 This is the basic instruction for beginning your daily practice.

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:55.200
 When you do Vajrayana practice,

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:59.200
 it is very important to establish the personal connection with the lama

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:01.200
 and with Guru Padmasambhava.

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:03.200
 By connecting with Guru Padmasambhava,

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:08.200
 you receive his assistance in understanding the true nature of the mind.

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:11.200
 Doing Guru Yoga practice also brings a very close connection

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:13.200
 to your personal teacher,

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:16.200
 who exemplifies the realization gained by the practice.

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:18.200
 When you connect with a personal teacher,

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:20.200
 you have an auspicious situation,

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:23.200
 similar to that of Guru Padmasambhava's 25 disciples,

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:30.200
 all of whom became enlightened by following the instructions of the teacher.

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:42.200
 What do you think, Live?

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:49.200
 I mean, the first part in this section is kind of talking about what Anne brought up too,

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:59.200
 just as far as that link of the way our concentration gives in a way for our focus

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:03.200
 and our devotion.

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:08.200
 I'm not sure what my thoughts are about that, besides just it's a big one.

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:11.200
 Sorry, as you were reading, I did have a thought.

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:15.200
 If someone else has something, I'll bring it up.

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:19.200
 Okay, how does this Guru Yoga...

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:22.200
 Buddhism is a non-theistic tradition,

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.200
 and there's a lot of theistic traditions.

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:31.200
 So how is this Guru Yoga not a theistic supplication to someone greater than you

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:33.200
 or more powerful or something?

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:35.200
 And you're asking for the thing...

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:37.200
 What's the difference there between Guru Yoga?

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:40.200
 How can we have Guru Yoga and still be non-theistic?

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:44.200
 Because from an outsider's perspective, it may look just like you're saying from it.

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:46.200
 It may look theistic.

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:50.200
 It may look like we're praying to this external deity.

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:55.200
 So what are we doing or how is it different?

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:58.200
 We're trying to recognize the nature of our own mind.

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:01.200
 We're trying to benefit all beings.

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:04.200
 We're trying to...

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:08.200
 We're also hopefully applying the instructions and the meditation on,

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:11.200
 like you mentioned earlier, emptiness

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:15.200
 and the great openness that fundamentally, like even in the instructions,

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:21.200
 Guru Rinpoche is not... is a light body.

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:24.200
 There's nothing to grasp. It's not ordinary.

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:27.200
 And then further in the instructions usually...

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:33.200
 We might be in our ordinary form too, but a lot of the instructions are also recognizing

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:38.200
 everything is kind of in that state, like a rainbow in the sky.

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:44.200
 So kind of that fundamental, really important point that there isn't

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:46.200
 a substantially existing someone.

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:51.200
 We're trying to come to a fuller understanding of that.

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:56.200
 And then with these blessings, like the nature of our mind, like it says too,

00:27:56.200 --> 00:28:00.200
 it is inconceivable. It's beyond grasping.

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:05.200
 And then just how the Guru embodies that realization

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:10.200
 is an appearance to our mind

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:14.200
 of the expressive quality of that realization

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:19.200
 to turn our own minds and all beings towards realizing their true nature

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:25.200
 and that inconceivable nature and inconceivable kind of realization.

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:29.200
 I think that's a lot of what's by that point of devotion

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:33.200
 and opening our mind and heart.

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:37.200
 There's like no formula we could really write out

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:43.200
 that describes how blessings work or what blessings are.

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:46.200
 Just in that sense of like, it's inconceivable.

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:53.200
 What we're opening to is inconceivable beyond any map we can make.

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:58.200
 But we have these kind of guidelines and a really structured, reliable

00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:03.200
 set of lineage instructions that help according to our capacities

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:06.200
 to connect and focus our mind.

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:11.200
 But in that direction, asher am I, it's like that.

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:14.200
 That's great.

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:17.200
 I would focus in terms of what Lai was saying in particular

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:22.200
 about how recognition that Guruji is empty and that we're empty

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:27.200
 and all the foundational teachings that we have as a basis

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:31.200
 for this of knowing that we're going beyond

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:34.200
 perceiver and perceived, that kind of dualistic mind

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:38.200
 that we're not thinking that he's really some legal guy up there.

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:44.200
 So it really is different in terms of the internal understanding.

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:51.200
 Is he, in one way to put it, is he like an image of our nuxim,

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:54.200
 original mind or fundamental mind? Would you say that?

00:29:54.200 --> 00:30:00.200
 Or is blessings coming from ourselves from that non-conceptual place

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:04.200
 of ourselves or what? That's just a thought. I don't know.

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:06.200
 Yeah, that's a good question.

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:09.200
 I mean, in here they say both, even in this chapter.

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:12.200
 And that's kind of what I was getting at too at that point.

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:15.200
 I mean, it just seems to do that inconceivable thing.

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:19.200
 I mean, yes, there's things we can say that maybe are true.

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:23.200
 But like that, it's like, yes, yes.

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:26.200
 But in terms of specifically what we're saying,

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:29.200
 where are the blessings coming from?

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:31.200
 Are they really... is that what you were saying?

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:32.200
 Yeah, I was thinking...

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:34.200
 Is it really coming from the nature of our mind?

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:36.200
 Are we really kind of blessing ourselves?

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:41.200
 Yeah, that's just a theory.

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:45.200
 They mentioned in this chapter that where are the Buddhas?

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:52.200
 There are actual Buddhas that do actually exist in the universe,

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:57.200
 like Guru Padmasambhava, but also it's a display.
