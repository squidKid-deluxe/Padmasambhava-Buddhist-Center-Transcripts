00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.500
 "And when you have the realization of emptiness," he asked to Atisha, "when you have the

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.000
 realization of emptiness, then we will stop the negative activities."

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:30.170
 That's what the Rangtamba asked to Atisha. Atisha answered it. "And when you have the realization

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:31.550
 of the emptiness, that individual is never going to do any negative activities, any negative

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:32.000
 activities."

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:41.420
 Compassion is bursting. You discover the same time you discover the emptiness of that. It's not

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.000
 just one after another.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.290
 Therefore, for example, all these Buddhas, all those great beings, when we read the life story of

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.000
 thought, they are the great masters.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.040
 They are such a religion for them. But they are hard in compassion. How strong, how immense, really

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.000
 they have.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 When we read the life story, they are translated now.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:14.470
 How much both of our master papa Ramachas and the Jungmulabas, everyone, because when you have such

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.000
 a great compassion, also they are so humble.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:26.740
 They are so simple, not burst and carried by the arrogance or the ego-clingings. So gentle, so

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.000
 peaceful, so down to the earth.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:40.010
 That is what really the practice is. And I mean, read Buddha's life stories. How Buddha is humble,

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.000
 simple.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:49.750
 And again, the teaching says, Buddha walks with, carries his own begging book. Then begging book

00:01:49.750 --> 00:02:00.000
 walks with bare feet, bare feet with the student, place to place, place to place.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:09.640
 That shows how humbles. Buddha is a teacher of all the kings at that time. And of course, his

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:18.000
 parents too. His family is his grandson, son of a king or royal.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:27.410
 And he is a teacher of all those great, powerful beings in their times and rich, wilderness. But

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:35.560
 yet, he walks with bare feet, or he is not going with charity, or the golden charity, all those

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.000
 decorated things.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.980
 Walking with bare feet, place to place, and staying on the trees, and putting his dharma rops, dh

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.000
arma rops under the ground, ground on the ground.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:57.400
 Lay out who is in it. Sit, sit. One time Buddha said, "Ananda, I need rest." Even though Buddha is

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:05.040
 never beyond the old head and all that, but when he reached that old, quite old head, maybe in the

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.000
 70s, he said, "Ananda, I need rest."

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:23.510
 Ananda did this, and he laid, he said, "Rest, for example." He said, "I just can't hold this face.

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.000
 It's simple, humble. That's filled with great compassion."

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.500
 This is the realization, all this, when you got realization, even Buddha looks like an external

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:43.000
 death, but in his inner levels, everything is purely, purely.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:51.910
 He isn't always in it, somehow, purely, all the time. But yet, in externally, he showed that to us,

00:03:51.910 --> 00:04:00.560
 to example to you, of how we have to be standing with this, to discover our inner beautiful natures

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.000
.
