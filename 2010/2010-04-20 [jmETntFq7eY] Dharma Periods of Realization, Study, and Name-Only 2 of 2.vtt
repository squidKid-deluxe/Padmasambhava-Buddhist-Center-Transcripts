In this video clip, the Khenpo Rinpoches teach on the ten periods of 500 years that began when the Buddha first turned the Wheel of Dharma, and how the study and practice of the Buddhdharma gradually declines over the years due to how much people incorporate the Buddha's teachings on ethics, concentration, and meditation. 2 of 2",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.800
 "Reversed" in a way, all that, in one way, that "reversed" and Loh Yum said, "This period of this

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:14.040
 time was really like the period of the practice of time, practice of time, and that, therefore,

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.120
 realization will come."

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:28.380
 He said, "Look to the, I mean, don't have to say this too much, read that in pupils, pupils. This

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.480
 time, many pupils have a lot of renunciation, a lot of devotion, both each other, both each other,

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.730
 and they're really so eager, interested in how many pupils practice and how many pupils are eager

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:40.560
 to practice.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:47.480
 And so, therefore, this realization period is now." And he really started, again, with change and

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.840
 interpreted slightly different ways.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:56.290
 I mean, so, this is generally the kind of way to explain. But, however, time goes, not always go

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.440
 better. Better is always generated, degenerated.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:07.120
 That's how the circles go up and down, and that's just the situation of this time.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.240
 So, therefore, I mean, here, as this parent says, "Because..."

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:32.990
 And so, this is the, that's what it is. So, now, here, yes, it's set here, it's set, and it's at

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.280
 the end of the degeneration.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:48.200
 So, therefore, at that time, due to the power of the bad karma and bad action, therefore, then

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.920
 there's always the experience,

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.080
 a lot of sufferings by the individualist or the certain beings.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:02.680
 "Then I'm not going to give anything very much to think of all the spiritual degeneration, those

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.840
 who are going to go through pain and sufferings, and through your kindness."

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:18.200
 Watch, through your compassion, watch and look to these beings, and then give me some teaching and

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.720
 prayers that it will, that prayer can protect the sufferings of those

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.480
 who are, who are going to suffer.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.090
 "But I'm not going to give anything very much to think of all the spiritual degeneration, because I

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.960
'm not going to give anything very much to think of all the spiritual degeneration."

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.600
 "I'm going to give something to you."

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.760
 And then listen.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:38.800
 "I'm going to give something to you."

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.720
 "I'm going to give something to you."

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.840
 Is his name, the prince's name.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.440
 "I'm going to give something to you."

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.640
 "I'm going to give something to you."

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.960
 "I'm going to give something to you."

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.000
 "I'm going to give something to you."

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.360
 "I'm going to give something to you."

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.840
 "I'm going to give something to you."

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:19.690
 And listen, he said, "There's not hot, hot, hot calamity, that the jajjic blend will never come. It

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:20.200
 is a strength. It is a strength."

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:28.890
 And then jajjic is, most of the time, is a blend. I think wine, wine, or what's it called, krapal,

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.320
 krapal, krapal, krapal, krapal, krapal, krapal, krapal, krapal, krapal, krapal, krapal, krapal, k

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.800
rapal, krapal, krapal, krapal, krapal, krapal, krapal, krapal, krapal, krapal.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.840
 "It grows with the other planets, plants of trees."

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:58.880
 It is wine, or wine, like that, and so, in the way, it is used for the oral medicines, but also

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:04.520
 more than that, they use to color the ropes, it has red color.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:12.940
 And all the, like, those red colors in Tibetan fabrics, the woolen fabrics, that's the way they use

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.600
 these two colors.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:31.390
 So, if that color won't grow, I think high altitude, we see this in Southern Tibet, and so here,

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.200
 when somebody used example,

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:43.640
 "If there is no hard calamities, the power of the jacik plant will never come."

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:56.840
 And similarly, if there is no farmland of the devotion of the pet, then there is no spark sprout,

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.080
 sprout of the enlightenment never grows, or will never grow,

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.920
 if there is no field of the pet, or the devotion.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:18.040
 "And the trust and confidence have to be to the three jewels."

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:24.010
 Or, if you don't have the trust and the confidence to the three jewels, the blessings will be

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:25.240
 distant.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:37.570
 That means, if we have the trust and the confidence to the three jewels, the blessing is very close

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:38.000
.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.160
 And again, furthermore, listen, please.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:50.040
 If you don't have the trust and the confidence to the three jewels, then you will never be able to

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.440
 see them again.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:06:00.560
 And all the brothers and brothers that got enlightenment is the only purpose, to benefit from all

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.240
 the beings.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:16.120
 Therefore, their activities, beneficial activities, are continuing on season.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:39.080
 However, due to the powers and strength of the five poisons, saturated to these beings of citrines,

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:46.920
 all this ego-clinking and ego-clinking is so powerful, and with the five poisons, it is saturated

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:53.960
 and so strongly desolate to these beings of citrines.

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:59.620
 Even the brothers and brothers that were continually working and helping benefit from all the

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:00.280
 beings,

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:08.520
 yet they cannot completely empty out of these suffering and difficulties of the beings.

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:16.440
 The power of the negative, the power of the negative, the power of the negative, the power of the

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:16.440
 negative.

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:33.050
 And the prince yourself, and even the prince, yourself and you like to help to your children, or

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:35.000
 your princess, or your children,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 and as well as all subject of dividends, that you like to help and protect from the sufferings.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:58.920
 If you like to help, first yourself, develop unfailable confidence or the trusty of the devotion,

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:07.830
 or unfailable devotion that you must develop in your heart, and then with that confidence, with

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:09.080
 that devotion,

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:18.840
 you must rely your heart absolutely to the three jewels.
