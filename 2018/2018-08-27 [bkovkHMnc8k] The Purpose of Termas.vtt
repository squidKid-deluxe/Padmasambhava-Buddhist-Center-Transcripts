00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440
 "Not academic teachings, not just only for academics, but it is to do practicing. Even

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.880
 Pada Chigi gives us this, as we say, three verses. Verses that come from studying, verses

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:19.740
 that come from contemplating, verses that come from practicing meditation, all that

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:26.460
 teaching tells us. But the ultimate goal is practices. If we start, we contemplate, then

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.840
 we become an act of action. It won't bear the fruit, exactly what we really wanted,

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.420
 according to teaching. If we let it become as the language of Mamsambhava, or Buddha

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.440
 Chitrimul himself, or the Nagarjuna, and all these great master's thetums of Armita,

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.640
 they are practices. They are started, they are contemplated, then final result of the

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.720
 study and contemplate is practices. When you come to the practices, and then Buddha

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:02.160
 teaching is vast, and there is over a hundred world of teachings, sutta, abhidharma, vinaya

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.900
 teaching, dandar teaching, all that. But those great master's are condensed, how to practice

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.880
 that. That is what nakol is practiced. So it's manual, easy to practice, it's simple.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.880
 Particularly, M.R. Chigi is very simple, simple and essence, condensed practices. Particularly,

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:28.600
 M.R. Chigi is mostly its teachings of the inner tantras, all inner tantras. Dhamma teaching

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:35.120
 has also some sutta teachings, and as Dhamma discovery, and as well, outer tantras. But

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.760
 most of the time, it's inner tantras. Inner tantra is then, hundreds of the essence of

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:46.440
 the Mahayava teaching, essence of the Anu-yoga teaching, essence of the Ati-yoga teaching,

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:53.400
 all the combination of these three inner tantra teachings. That is what it is. And that also

00:01:53.400 --> 00:02:00.520
 summarizes all that, and most of the time, Dhamma teachings are known as "la zu tuk-sung"

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:09.720
 in the Tibetan. "La zu tuk-sung." "Lama tuk-la" and "zo kwa," "zo qin," "zo qin practice."

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.800
 Those are the Dhamma teachings. "Lama" means practices of the gurus or lamas, many best

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:22.200
 on the Guru Pima Sambha, and also other teachings, but it's practicing on the Guru Pima Sambha.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.360
 It's all in today's variety of the teachings on the Guru Pima Sambha. Practicing Guru Pima Sambha

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.960
 as a wrath of deity, practicing Guru Pima Sambha peace of deity, practicing Guru Pima Sambha

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:40.120
 as a semi-wrath of deities, or practicing Guru Pima Sambha as the pacifying deity, or the

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.000
 increasing,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.600
 monetizing, subjugating, relating to the variety of that practice, all known as

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:56.840
 Dhamma practices, lamas. And then this "la zu," second is "zo qin" practices.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:03.880
 "Zu" has generally been isolated into any, it is known as "completion practices."

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:11.680
 There are two "completion practices" as you all know, that is "zo qin" or in the end I said "com

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.960
pletion

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:17.240
 practices of the, with the characteristics and completion practices of the, with all the

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:24.120
 characteristics." So these are all known as "zo qin" practices or the "zo qin" practices.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:31.240
 "Zoram," maybe I should use "zoram" practices. "Zoram," "zoram" is a completion practice. So

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.120
 correctly, with the characteristics, with all the practices. Now I'm sure you know what that

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:44.200
 character means. It means, means it's practicing of the such as, if I simply say "zar," "lung,"

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.800
 "dungu" practices, those all known as characteristics of the completion practices.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:58.360
 "Zar" is general practices. "Lung" is wind practices. "Dhamma" is inner heat practices.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.160
 And generally all those are connected. Those are known as the characteristics

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:09.800
 of the completion practices. Why is called characteristics? Because this is something,

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:15.800
 why is called also "completion" because it is inherited from natural quality of our

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:24.360
 physical conditions. It's everything is all here. Channel is completed, wind is completed

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:33.480
 and essence element is completed. When we are activating that, we begin to reveal the beauty

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:41.000
 and the nature of each of those. Finally the primordial was well discovered. Those are known

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 as the completion stage of practice with the characteristics because "zar" is a

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.920
 characteristic. It means it has its formation, it has explanation, it has all the variety.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:58.440
 And along with the wind, "A" it has also characteristics, it has a formation, it has

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:05.000
 a lot of different, this, that. I mean it's all structured in mundane levels that, levels.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:12.040
 And then essence element is also characteristics. It has different shapes and forms and feelings

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:18.360
 and this and that, all combination. That is therefore this is called characteristics

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:27.240
 or something existing. But when you use that exactly with techniques, techniques or according

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:35.800
 instructions, it will revert finally. Eventually it will revert. The primordial was a clay-like

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:45.080
 luminosity called that is ultimate goal. With all the ultimate goal of the clay-like luminosity,

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:50.680
 that one common practice is always in the Buddha teaching mentioned is sensation practices.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:57.560
 It's not just really, it is good, it has a lot of benefit, but it's a sensation.

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:04.760
 Sensation means it has grasping, clinging. Grasping, clinging, whether it's good or bad,

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:11.080
 ultimately it will make trouble. It is clinging. Clinging that won't go far.

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:20.600
 But for that reason, always everything, channel, wind, correct, the essence element of Tomo

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.320
 practice

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:27.880
 have to be moved to the clay-like luminosity status. Clay-like luminosity is beyond the

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:35.640
 conception. That is zuokin practice, zuokin. Then with all the characteristics practice is zuokin,

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:43.880
 zuokin practice. Zuokin practice is beyond the conceptions, beyond the grasping. You're not

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:51.080
 practicing conception. We practice it beyond the conception. Therefore, it is called beyond

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:57.160
 the characteristics practices. So all those teachings, teachings are known as generally

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:02.760
 zoram practices and particularly zuokin. So there my teaching, that zuokin teaching,

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:09.080
 which has so many varieties of the zuokin teachings, I mean not variety, but many different

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:15.610
 lineage teachings. Lineage from the Murpema Samala, lineage from the Muman Mathara, lineage from

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:15.800
 the

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:22.280
 Great Aslee, where are Jana teachings. Each of these varieties of the dharma teachings of

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:28.520
 that directly explaining of the zuokin teachings. Zuokin teaching. So those teachings are known as

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:35.880
 the essence of the inner center, particularly zuokin teachings. That is called la, sorry, zoram

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:46.760
 or zuokin teachings. And then tuk-sang, so la, zuok, tauk-sang, I said. Tau, tau is known as the

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:52.920
 great verse in the mind, but that particularly related with the practicing of the jainese,

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:59.960
 our loknihara practices. Jainese is so important in the, in the vajayala teaching, or particularly

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:06.200
 in the, in the Tibetan Buddhism. And because in the teaching said, jainese practice is that,

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:13.720
 is the essential practices because it's compassion, love and kindness. The ultimately there is the

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:19.080
 great, the great, clear line of the ministry arising as externally, that is compassion.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:27.880
 Compassion is a part of the nature of the mind, nature of our qualities. So jainese is that great

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:35.960
 compassion, a great form of the form of duty, known as jainese. Ultimately jainese is a compassion.

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:41.800
 So there is a variety of the teaching. And then generally in the Tibetan teaching always said

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:48.440
 Tibetan is very much connected with our loknihara, jainese. Since the, where the history begins is

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:53.320
 connected with, with our loknihara, you know, I'm sure you heard, many of you heard that,

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:59.080
 I mean, no, you already know that. Tibetan rest begins with the monkeys and the mountain, the

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:06.760
 female, uh, uh, female gods, goddesses or female, the cannibal goddess in the teachings, the

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:07.400
 combination

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:17.720
 of the monkey and that female, uh, uh, dam, demon or cannibal combination, the Tibetan rest begins.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:26.600
 And that, that what's called this monkey is the emanation of the jainese. And that female, uh,

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:35.400
 the cannibal was the emanation of the thalas. So always in the, even his story, they said the

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:42.280
 Tibetan is very much connected to the our loknihara, jainese. And then because of that, all the

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:48.440
 teachings, all that in the Tibetan, they all say, even the child, when the babies will begin to

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:49.080
 call

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:56.520
 mothers, mother as Amma, at that moment they know how to chime the Ammani premium, the matter of

00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:03.560
 our loknihara. They know that, how, that tells how much Tibetan are connected with our loknihara.

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:10.360
 Therefore, then there is also a lot of variety teachings of the jainese practice known as

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:17.530
 tukdap, tukdap meaning, the practice. So those are the one, many practices and then related with

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:17.880
 the

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:25.160
 hirukas and so forth, all that in my teaching. So that is the one that I really did, then my

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:25.480
 teaching.

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:32.440
 And now, then my teaching is also, there's so many the thetengams came, as I said, around the 11th

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:38.520
 century, in the, in the, around that time or the beginning of the 11th century until now. So many

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:44.200
 great thetengams. What are those thetengams, generally? Thetengams are in a, they are the

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:50.840
 emanation of the 25 disciples from Gurope and Masambhava or 80 Mahasadas of the Yerba regions,

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:56.920
 or many other those great enlightened beings. And simple way, in the Sotra level, if we say,

00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:04.090
 they are great Bodhisattva and Mahasathas, they emanate it. Then, in a way, if I say common

00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:04.600
 language,

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:10.120
 they are, with the Gurope and Masambhava, with the Hinchodya, with the Kintuson, these all great

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:19.260
 Mahasadas, mutual agreement, meant they will take the reincarnation, emanation, again and again in

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:19.400
 order

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:26.600
 to benefit to all the living beings and particularly to revere this them of teachings. And that I

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:26.920
 just

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:37.880
 mentioned yesterday that Mungkaba Gungti Jhupa that designated and provides those meanings.

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:44.520
 So there is variety thetengams came. Why that many thetengams need to come? And the teaching said,

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:49.960
 what the Gurope and Masambhava said in the teaching, teaching said, because thetengams are very,

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:58.280
 them are teachings, the thetengams are very important, because time is changing. Generation,

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:05.960
 upper generation, time is changing. Therefore, human mentality is changing, situation is changing,

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:11.560
 circumstances are changing. Therefore, always individuals are looking something new,

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:17.320
 new things. Even the reality is the same teaching, but they are looking new things.

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:26.200
 For that reason, I, Gurope and Masambhava, hated many thetengams. And then together with it, also

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:32.680
 those thetengams, teachings, are always in the teaching said, they are so powerful, so important,

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:40.840
 beneficial to remove the disturbances of those different generations. And balancing the elementus

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:49.080
 and really activating the strength and the balance, energy of the earth and elements, and remove

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:49.240
 the

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:57.080
 walls and the famines, the disease and so forth. Those reasons, then many thetengams came, revealed

00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:04.040
 one after another, those great theta teachings, one after another. So today we are going to the

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:11.260
 thetengams. When we are talking about the theta, we are talking about the history of how this takes

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.560
 place, how that happens, and how that happens.

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:21.160
 This story of the theta teaching, as I said yesterday, in one way they are so, so convertible,

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:28.280
 simple and ordinary, and drawn to the legacy, regular, really nothing, any big experience.

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:35.880
 But the other side is amazing, marvelous, unbelievable, incredible. I mean, if you,

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:41.400
 when you read or when you look, when you, we go through this, the histories, one after another,

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:48.120
 it's really marvelous. So it's a combination of that. That means, in the spiritual level,

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:54.680
 this individualist, where they perform, is totally beyond that mind. He just said beyond the mind.

00:13:55.400 --> 00:14:02.120
 But in the kind of mundane level, in the world level, they are so drawn to the earth, so simple,

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:09.320
 so humble, so follow with the exact system of the where things should be drawn in the mundane world

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:09.480
.

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:15.480
 So this, in a way, with the reverse theta teachings, there's also in a way a combination of that,

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:23.160
 perform the level of the mundane kind of where things should be drawn, and same time,

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:30.200
 additional with it, with the power of the realization, incredible, unbelievable activities.

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:36.520
 So now we go through again, one more time, we say that how we
