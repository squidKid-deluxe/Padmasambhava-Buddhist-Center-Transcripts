00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.830
 Now we talk this time, this teaching to causal Mahayana and the result Mahayana, we are talking

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.000
 about nature that we don't normally see all the time.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 Don't kind of know, is ignored even though it's so close with us, it's so close with us.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 This nature is known as Buddha-nature. It is shining stars in our heart center to everyone.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:44.430
 It is shining galaxies, galaxies in our heart, the indestructible stars, indestructible galaxies

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.000
 that are within our heart center.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 Our nature state, this is what talking about the causal Yana and Mahayana started from there.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:08.420
 Now our goal, the practical goal of Buddhism is to reveal that shining star, star completely

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.000
 brilliant as Buddha did, Buddha Shakyamuni did,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 as Guru Pema Sambhav did, as Jairan Zavada Awalaki Hara did, as Tara did.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 We can, we should do that because we have the same nature.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:41.030
 This nature, even though we don't know this, identify it, you mean know or identify that, but we

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.000
 are always guided with this nature.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:56.090
 All the time, we are with the light of this nature. Nature, we are always warned of this nature,

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.000
 whether we knew and whether we don't know.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.680
 No. That was always the great master's often said, and the teaching said, and the great master

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.000
 again, I'm sure many of you heard,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.990
 Palma Kendi Parthi Sharam but also he said so many times, we are with this nature or whether we

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.000
 know and whether we don't know.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.470
 It's not something mystery that we don't can feel anything. It's something only that we didn't

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.000
 notice it.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:34.020
 We can in a way, it let go pass always, and we're looking something else, and looking something

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.000
 else always, and we miss the point.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:46.420
 That nature is, what is that? That power and energy and the dense nature of this, is the energy of

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.000
 this nature is known as love, loving kindness,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:02.800
 compassion, wisdom, intelligence, joy and respect and appreciation. Those basic things is not

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:09.000
 mystery. Love and compassion and kindness, joy and appreciation,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:19.050
 they are so basic, so, so general. It's like sunshine. It's like water. It's like air. Without this

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.000
, we cannot survive.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 But yet, we don't can't really appreciate and honor this and looking something else.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:36.990
 This love and compassion and wisdom and intelligence, these are the out coming power of this Buddha

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:38.000
 nature.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:46.280
 This shining star that I said in the heart center, which is residing. This is the nature, what we

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.000
 have.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.290
 Even the worst time of our difficult time, we have this nature, the nature during the left. Even

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.000
 the worst and the difficult,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 miserable times of the human being or the sentient being go through, we always have this nature.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:10.210
 There's no one who is out of love, out of compassion, out of the wisdom, intelligence. Everyone has

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:11.000
 that.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:18.600
 It is the shining star. They are the brilliant, radiating qualities. It's guiding their every

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.000
 movement.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 Even this has so many kind of all the different negative forces, such as emotion, negative and ego.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 All that disturbing one approach, but it bounced back. It's coming up. You have that quality.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 This is the Buddha nature. And now to discover this nature, then Buddha taught through technique.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 Way kind of more graduation way, very general way and a very kind of instant race.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 So this graduation way, technique is known as in Mahayana, causal.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:08.130
 That means when you plant the seed on the garden, nice garden, garden, and then we continue taking

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:09.000
 care of that,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:17.870
 taking care of that with your effort, and then autumn or after a while, it brings the result

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:19.000
 through.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 So it is a continuing taking care of that. And these are like more cause, working with the cause,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 working with the condition,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 working with the seed, and let it grow and develop that. That is known as causal Mahayana.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:41.990
 And what we have to do, both have to do what? Whether it is the causal yana and the result Mahayana

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000
,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 we have to develop the same motivation, joy and appreciation, both each other.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 Those are, as I already said, it is outreaching light of Buddha nature.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:06.230
 They are, I always kind of thought, this Buddha bodhicitta, joy and love and compassion is like, is

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:08.000
 what you call here.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 Jacob's ladder. What is Jacob's ladder?

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 Jacob's ladder, he don't know? J-A-C-O-B. Jacob's ladder, L-A-D-D-E-R, I believe.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 I hope so. Jacob's ladder. You know that?

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 That's it. This love and compassion wisdom is ladder of the Buddha nature.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 It is come from the sun, sun of the Buddha nature and rascing us.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 Rascuing individually the trouble or the difficult times.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:11.000
 Or it is ushering that. So this is what love and compassion, wisdom is so important.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:18.370
 Whether you follow with the result Mahayana and whether we are practicing as a result Mahayana, we

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:21.000
 all need this.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:28.040
 So with this understanding, with this understanding, then walking with joyful effort and bring the

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:35.000
 realization gradually, such as known as the path and ten boomies.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:42.180
 I think many of you know. And then reaching the enlightenment one, gradually that is known as the

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:50.000
 causal teaching or the teaching that will make the cause to develop full bloom results.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:08:01.000
 Result of probation status. Then the second teaching is known as the result Mahayana.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 Result. Result is what? Result is the result.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:22.430
 I think result is a result. Also it can be like a result. R-E-S-O-R-T, I think. It's a result.

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:25.000
 Result of a result.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:34.860
 No, what are you going to use? That result Mahayana. That means we are not waiting for long process

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:39.000
 to gain that achievement or the result.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 Instantly we are jumping to the lap of luxuries. Immediately jumping. That means which lap? Lap or

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 luxuries of the Buddha natural.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:02.420
 Immediately you are jumping. And that is known as the result. Even though it moves, you get all

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:07.000
 those five parts and ten boomies, but it went so fast.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 So it is like more result. Result. So this is the two teachings.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 Both need similar attitude, similar intention, similar go up. Go to that.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:26.610
 Which is bodhicata, the kindness, the compassion, joy, and appreciation, all those beautiful things

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:27.000
.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.000
 And then reaching the realization. So these two results, two teachings.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:41.220
 A result, a causal Mahayana, a result Mahayana. Which is what that is not a terminology. Maybe you

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:42.000
 are more familiar with that.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 And that is known as Sutra Mahayana and Tantra Mahayana.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 So Sutra Mahayana is a causal Mahayana and Tantra Mahayana is a result Mahayana.
