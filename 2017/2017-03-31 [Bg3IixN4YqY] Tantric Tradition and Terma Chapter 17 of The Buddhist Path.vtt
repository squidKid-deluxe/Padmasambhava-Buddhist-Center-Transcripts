00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
 Welcome. Thanks for joining us. This is the PBC Morning Dawn study group at Padmasamyalang,

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.040
 the Venerable Kempo Rinpoche's Monastery and Retreat Center in New York. This is the 17th

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.800
 time we've done this discussion group on the Kempo Rinpoche's book, The Buddhist Path. This

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:24.240
 is Chapter 17. It's entitled The Tantric Tradition and Terma, beginning on page 83 of that same

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:24.480
 book.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.880
 So we'll begin with opening prayers like usual, and then we'll have the discussion. Thanks so

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:30.880
 much.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:23.640
 [Tibetan chanting]

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.760
 This is the supreme tradition of the glorious Buddha Padmasambhava, which is the essential

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.640
 and extraordinary view and doctrine of the early translation school. You keep alive and

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.920
 spread by the light of wisdom. Lord of Dharma, great Kempo, I pray at your Lord's feet.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.520
 In the palace of the Oakman, Dharma Daptu, the essence of all the Buddhas of the three

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.640
 times, the one who shows clearly the Dharmakāya of my own mind, we pray to the honourable

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.200
 Rūpa Rūpa Rūpa, glorious in your future, the precious one, dwelling on the Lord's

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.760
 seat on the crown of my head, hold me with your great kindness, nimisto the accomplishments

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.400
 of body, speech and mind.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:32.760
 [Tibetan chanting]

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:49.360
 So this is Chapter 17 in the Buddhist Path, Tantric Tradition in Therma, page 83. We'll

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.320
 do a quick summary of the first half of the chapter and then go into the discussion. So

00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:00.640
 the Venerable Kumbhāramacās begin by defining the term tantra, as the tantra means continuity

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.320
 and refers to the unchanging nature of the mind. The scriptures that teach about this

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:11.080
 unchanging Vajra nature are called the Tantras, and the techniques used to directly reveal

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.700
 the mind's nature are known as Tantrayana or Vajrayana.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.880
 They then go on to say that sometimes people ask if there is a difference in the role of

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.760
 women and men in the Vajrayana Buddhism, and Rinpoche say that all people have the same

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.040
 authority to become teachers and the same opportunity for realization. In the inner

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:39.120
 Tantras the 14th root Samaya seems to honor and appreciate women even more than men. They

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.240
 continue by saying Buddhism first spread from Tibet from India in the 5th century and continued

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:49.760
 in the 8th century during the time of Guru Padmasambhava. This first wave of Buddhism

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.320
 into Tibet is known as nimma or the ancient ones. In the 11th century a second wave of

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:01.040
 Buddhism came to Tibet from India which is collectively known as Sarma, are the new schools

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:07.320
 comprised of the Kalam Geluk, Kagu and Sakya traditions. All of these schools came from

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:12.160
 the Buddha, teach Vajrayana Buddhism and are complete paths to enlightenment each with

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.920
 their own lineages of masters and scholars. The nimma school in particular is made up

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:24.400
 of the long oral lineage of Kama and the close revealed treasure lineage of Turma. Turmas

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:30.320
 are teachings and objects hidden by Guru Rinpoche and Yeshay Sojal in Tibet in the 8th century

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.520
 to benefit beings in the future. The wisdom to Kinney Yeshay Sojal was one of Guru Rinpoche's

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:41.040
 nine heart disciples who achieved enlightenment in a single lifetime. Turma teachings were

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.760
 mainly written down by Yeshay Sojal as instructed by Guru Rinpoche and were hidden throughout

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:51.160
 Tibet and other countries through meditation power, often times without leaving the meditation

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:56.600
 cushion at all. They were hidden in various places like inside rock mountains, underwater

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:03.600
 in lakes and rivers, within glaciers and buildings and they were left as ritual objects as well

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:09.440
 as actual Dharma teachings and sometimes these Turma were even hidden and revealed within

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:22.680
 the mind streams of one of the 25 disciples of Guru Rinpoche. So that's the summary of

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.680
 the first half.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:32.720
 So the first section to discuss is from page 83, the first paragraph and then page 85,

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:41.400
 the first full paragraph. Tantra is a Sanskrit word that means continuity. Tantra refers

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:47.760
 primarily to the unchanging nature of the mind which continues without interruption

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:55.080
 from beginningless time until final enlightenment. The scriptures that teach the unchanging

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:02.760
 nature of the mind are called the tantras and the means to directly reveal the mind's nature

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:08.840
 are known as the tantrayana or the Vajrayana. Buddha Shakyamuni revealed many different

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:14.640
 types and levels of teachings to suit the various capacities of students. The highest

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:21.120
 section of his teaching is the Vajrayana which encompasses many practices such as the preliminary

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:29.360
 practices, the creation stage and completion stage practices, Mahamudra and Dzogchen. Many

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:34.880
 of the Vajrayana teachings of Guru Padma Sambhava were hidden in various parts of Tibet for

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:41.120
 the sake of future generations. These hidden treasures are called Turma in Tibetan and

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:47.840
 the people who reveal them are called Turtungs. The Turma treasures include texts and ritual

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:55.840
 objects that were hidden by Guru Padma Sambhava and Lady Yeshe Sojal in Tibet in the 8th century.

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:01.040
 Yeshe Sojal, one of Padma Sambhava's nine heart students, attained enlightenment in

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:07.560
 one lifetime. Yeshe Sojal left signs of her accomplishment such as writing verses in solid

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:18.680
 rock with her finger. I was thinking one thing that might be good to just kind of review

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:27.800
 a little bit is Rinpoche's here talking about the tantrayana in relation to Buddhism and

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:34.640
 the tantrayana Vajrayana and then kind of specifically go right to the Turma tradition

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:40.120
 but maybe just also give if we just kind of review and remember just basically kind of

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:48.700
 what what are the other traditions that are part of you know the Vajrayana Turma is one

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:54.260
 that I thought maybe that would be a nice place to start just you know if we just kind

00:07:54.260 --> 00:08:02.760
 of collectively kind of just remember a little bit more about the other elements that make

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:10.200
 us think about the practice speaking like the Kama lineage. That's one. I think because

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:15.360
 I remember reading somewhere where there's a family that the Kama lineage was really

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:19.240
 popular until the Turma lineage showed up because the Kama was like the spoken word

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:23.440
 from a teacher to a student. Remember I read that one correctly? That's it. It was that

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:28.920
 like that unbroken lineage. Of course it's two lineages. Yeah. Yeah. And then it was

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:33.900
 like the Turma lineage was showing up what was it like two hundred years later or I mean

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:40.700
 two hundred years after Kama is the mala or? Yeah. The Turma lineage began of course with

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:47.240
 Guru Rinpoche but the first term was revealed by Sanjay Lingpah. Sanjay Lama sorry, my bad.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:57.480
 Sanjay Lama I think he was born in one thousand. So yeah. That's when the Turma lineage arose.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:02.160
 And it's not I think at that point I think Rinpoche say for about three hundred years

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:08.360
 till about the 14th century Turma became very popular. And then it's popularity kind of

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:14.700
 eclipsed the Kama meaning it began to get more emphasis by people revealing Turma and

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:19.560
 then groups of students under those Turthans like practicing those specific teachings and

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:24.480
 not practicing certain other Kama teachings. But the Kama teachings themselves went back

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:29.840
 to Buddha Shakyamuni and then were passed all the way. I mean as Buddhism came into

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:36.040
 Tibet from Guru Rinpoche then they were passed from like you said teacher to disciple and

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:40.440
 then that disciple would apply the instruction become fully realized in that practice and

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:46.240
 they become a holder of that lineage and they pass that orally on to their students as well.

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:52.800
 So all the students of Guru Rinpoche during even this whole nimma like the official dates

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:58.960
 of the nimma school from like 8th century into about the late 10th century or 11th century

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:05.220
 was all actually Kama. So all the early masters in those 300 years or so were Kama lineage

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:11.720
 holders and then the Turma started to be revealed. But Rinpoche say very clearly that Kama is

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:16.520
 always the foundation of Turma. Turma is like an ornament of Kama and they always go

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:22.880
 hand in hand really. I mean it all goes back to the Buddha and then Guru Rinpoche. In particular

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:26.760
 between the lineages is there a distinction like is there creation stage and completion

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:36.760
 stage in Kama or you only find that in Turma? Kama is like a lifeblood of the teachings

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:41.640
 because that's the spoken word of the teacher from the mouth of the teacher to the ear of

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:47.800
 the student. They say a long lineage of Kama and a short or close lineage of Turma and

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:53.800
 they're all in those two. But the long lineage of Kama is like mainly what's been upheld

00:10:53.800 --> 00:11:00.720
 by like those six principal nimma, big nimma monasteries. That's what the instructions

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:06.680
 that are passed down orally from the teacher to the student in practice. So Guru Rinpoche

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:13.680
 said he says if you read, well I wish I had a quote here, in this like Kempo Rinpoche quote

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:20.920
 in light of fearless and destructible wisdom, he said if you read the lineage history then

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:29.840
 you'll find out just how important and beautiful the Kama, the Kama tradition is. So I guess

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:34.720
 the other question that I have is besides how it's transmitted, is there a distinguishing

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:39.080
 feature between the Kama and Turma lineages or is it just two versions of transmission?

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:44.880
 I mean in terms of like the practices that are done? Are there practices or is it more

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:51.640
 based on like meditation instruction? Is there, I mean, or is it really just, they both emphasize

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:57.520
 the same type of practices, it's just that one was transmitted, you know, in the way that

00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:05.080
 Turma is transmitted, what was passed down from teacher to student. Yeah, the only experience

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:11.280
 I have with Kama is one time I got very interested in the text chanting the names of Manjushri,

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:17.600
 Manjushri Namasam Niti, and that's the first text in the Tantras collection of the Khandra,

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:25.600
 that's the first text in the Tantras. And in the nimma Kama that has 46 volumes and I went

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:30.280
 looking for things on there and there's a long commentary on chanting the names of Manjushri

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:37.000
 by Pabasambhava. I found a short one by Gaurabh Dorje and a short one by Vimala Mitra. And

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.320
 so those are all nimma. And I think maybe this characterization of Kama and Nima, Kama

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:48.440
 and Turma is just within nimma because there's also many commentaries on chanting the names

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:56.000
 of Manjushri in the new schools, too, in terms of I think Naroka wrote one and I can't remember

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.040
 right now, but Alex Wayman has translated a text, a version of chanting the names of Manjushri,

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:08.720
 which is based on seeing that text as a description of the mandala of Manjushri of all the deities

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:14.680
 who are in the mandala, but then the ones that I was found in the nimma Kama were all

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:21.680
 ocean commentaries. So it's like, I think maybe Kama is a little bit more commentaries. There's

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:30.000
 more like teachings, but I don't know if there's commentaries in Turma as well or if Turma is more

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.400
 like practices. Well, I was just going to say that that's something I mean, similar just like you

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:41.440
 were saying that long lineage of Kama and close lineage of Turma, like what the specialness of

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:47.240
 that is so like, so wonderful, like with the Turma being the close lineage, because it's

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:52.800
 directly, it's directly from Guru Pichay and Nishi Sojal, you know, like it's, you know,

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:59.120
 whether it's the mind Turma or the scripts or these objects that are found, which I think we're

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:04.040
 going to talk about a little bit later in the chapter, but just that that's why it's close is

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:11.640
 because it's, it's, it's exactly from them. There's no gap in terms of time, you know, whereas with

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:17.880
 that long lineage, meaning that it's like you're saying from mouth to ear from teacher to student.

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:23.840
 So I mean, again, it's unbroken, and both are unbroken. But there's like this, in terms of time,

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:29.440
 there's this kind of option or availability for commentaries to come through in the Kama,

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:36.320
 whereas, I mean, there are in the Turma too, I'm sure, but, you know, not as a still warm with the

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:45.760
 Dakini's breath. It's still like hot off the press. So fresh. And I think that was part of, I think

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:45.880
,

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:54.880
 what Padmasambhava gave those teachings, but, you know, all in share, I'm sure so many others

00:14:54.880 --> 00:15:03.160
 too, like that aspect of the skillful means of Padmasambhava and Yishisogel, just in that, I mean,

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:11.960
 incredible seeing their wisdom mind so fast, really keeping this, these teachings going in their

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:18.080
 current time to students which were transmitted, but then all these treasures that were like,

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:25.320
 you know, these vast teachings given to like those assembled at that time. And then, you know,

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:32.600
 knowing exactly the conditions and which one of those students, you know, are connected and are

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:39.120
 going to be carrying, revealing the teachings in the future. So, and then when they are revealed in

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:45.040
 the future, to that Turtang, who did, you know, reveals them, like Amanda was saying, just that

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:51.560
 it's so fresh and it awakens all of those teachings in their own mind and heart, and then they put

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:59.960
 them into practice. And then it's like really fresh and undiluted. Not that the other, other ones,

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:07.000
 not that the Kama lineage is like diluted or anything, but it's just very fresh and like,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:13.600
 and appropriate for the time. And the people, the minds of the people, I mean, we're all human

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:13.760
 beings

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:18.920
 more or less the same throughout the ages, but you know, kind of particular to the different times.

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:25.320
 Is this one of the things that did seem interesting? Particularly, you know, at first doing the

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:29.040
 practices, it's more interesting. Oh, what's the, you know, what's the text actually saying? And

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:33.000
 sometimes it's really fascinating when you start looking into like the descriptions that are also

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.720
 left in there. You really see how, you know, this was tailored to this situation in this time.

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:45.240
 It makes it very beautiful. Well, I guess that's not the part of it. It's another beautiful aspect.

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:47.760
 Maybe that's another way of saying. It's another beautiful aspect.

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:54.600
 I thought, I don't know if you guys would, I did find when someone in this Deuteronomy described

00:16:54.600 --> 00:17:01.520
 the Kama in term, I'm not really condensed. Do you want to hear that? He says, the teachings,

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:06.480
 this is regarding the Kama from might of fearless and destructive wisdom. The teachings that were

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:11.980
 passed on from mouth to ear in unbroken succession from Buddhist Sakyamuni or from Buddhist Samatab

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:12.360
hadra

00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:17.800
 up to your own Rūdvāma are known as the long lineage of Kama. The Kama teaching is vast and

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:23.360
 profound containing fifth instructions for both sutra and tantra, but primarily for the three

00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:30.000
 divisions of the Nyingma inner tantras, do, ju, and sam. The sutra which gathers all the intentions

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:37.020
 of ani-yoga, the secret essence tantra, the net of magical illusions, to the Gurya-garva of Maha-y

00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:37.240
oga,

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:44.480
 and the sende, longde, and ningate, or the vast, expansive mind and fifth instructions class of

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:51.920
 zogchen or ata-yoga. So the three inner tantras, their seminal works. In woodblock form alone,

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:57.960
 the number of tantras in the Kama teaching is over 440 volumes, and that number is far exceeded by

00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:02.940
 the Kama teachings recorded in handwritten form. From the sutra point of view, they contain

00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:08.160
 ganaya and bodhisattva teachings. From the tantra point of view, they contain Kriya-upa and yoga

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:12.600
 teachings, and from the extraordinary Nyingma point of view, they contain the three inner tantra

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:22.630
 teachings, Maha-yoga, Ama-yoga, and Ata-yoga. Then he goes on here. Therefore, this Kama teaching

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:22.840
 is

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:27.080
 the foundation and heart of the Nyingma school, and from ancient times it spread beautifully in

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:32.160
 Tibet. Study the religious history of the Nyingma school and the biography of its masters, and you

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:37.000
 will see why the Nyingma Kama is so important. The Nyingma teachings were preserved and spread

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:43.000
 through group practice retreat, mandalas, sadhanas, fifth instruction, and oral explanation of the

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.960
 gi-garva, etc. In brief, the activities of studying practice continued without decrease in central

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:56.960
 Tibet at these six monasteries, six principal monasteries. And then there's just a short excerpt

00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:02.120
 on the term on the edge. He says, "For seeing the degeneration of the teachings and beings and

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:02.320
 times

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:09.280
 to come, Guru Rinpoche kindly hid an inconceivable number of treasure troves containing the Dharma,

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:14.040
 wealth, blessings, substance, and so forth in glaciers, rocky mountains, lakes, and many other

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:19.520
 places. When the time is right, turtons emanated, open the treasure doors, and spread the teachings

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:25.240
 they contained. These teachings then are known as the close lineage of the termas. This lineage

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:31.680
 comprises inconceivable pith instructions, yogic activities, and ritual practices of the creation

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:40.310
 completion stages, connected primarily with kang-gong-pur-sum. From early on, and up to the present

00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:40.320
,

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:47.440
 more than 100 major and over 1,000 lesser turtons have appeared. And that three is the kaje,

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:53.520
 the eight Haruka teachings, the first one, and the lama-gong-du, or teachings on the Guru, and then

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:58.880
 the purva is like bhajra-kalaya. Those are some of the principal terma classes. What page is that?

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:04.720
 I'm just talking here, I've seen it. 185 of the sisas that goes in the glossary. But I thought to

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:05.160
 mention too,

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:10.080
 that the terma is not a new precedent that just started up in the ninth century, like the prasana

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:15.140
 parvita teachings and nagarjuna. Those are described as terma. The five treatises of

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:21.600
 nitraya, you know, which were given to a sangha. Those are regarded as terma. So, and some people

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:27.680
 regard the whole Buddha's teaching, which was concealed as terma. To Rott, my link post there,

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:32.400
 that it's terma because it's concealed. It's a terma because it's hidden. It's a terma. And

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:37.680
 that's the meaning of the teaching, is like the Buddha's teaching, can also be categorized

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:48.160
 according to that. It's a treasure because it's concealed. It's a treasure because it is hidden.

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:53.280
 It's a treasure because it is inexhaustible. It is a treasure because it fulfills needs and wishes.

00:20:53.280 --> 00:21:01.760
 Could you just read that one part again in the terma about what it was saying? It mentioned like

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:06.040
 three things that are in there. One of them was rituals, because just in terms of that question

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:10.600
 about whether there's actually commentary in the terma. It doesn't sound like from what he said,

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:20.240
 at least in terms of ningma terma, that it's actually commentaries. As far as the calm of?

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:27.720
 No, it was in the title of the terma, paragraph. Inconceivable with its instruction, yogic

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:28.360
 activities

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:34.960
 and ritual practices of the creation and completion. So, I guess if you include all those earlier

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:35.200
 ones,

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:41.200
 those are definitely commentaries like Maitreya's text or commentaries. Like that ongoing

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.000
 exposition

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:48.720
 of the fundamental sutras and patras, that's the calm of any of them. All the way up to the present

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:48.840
 day.

00:21:48.840 --> 00:22:16.600
 If I could say one thing about the commentaries, I heard isn't the long-chain ning dig a commentary

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:27.760
 terma on all the ningma ningjig and the calm of ningjig? I think that's Longchepa's text that,

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:34.760
 what is it, the ning-ting yao-shi? That that's the two of those, in terms of the name Longchen ning

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:41.200
 and long-chain ning-ting. But I did just recently read that the long-chain ning-ting was revealed

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:41.320
 by

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:47.880
 Jigme Lingpa in the 18th century. But it has some text of Jigme Lingpa's own writings in it as well

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:47.880
,

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:54.140
 that it's not just the things that came to him from Longchenpa, but it has some of his own writings

00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:54.280
.

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:59.460
 I just thought I'd throw that in. But what you're thinking of, when we were talking about Longchen

00:22:59.460 --> 00:22:59.640
pa,

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:12.040
 having written commentaries on the conro, that that was part of his greatness is bringing together

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:13.480
 those texts.

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:25.560
 I'll just do the summary quick and then we'll do that. So halfway through the chapter,

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:31.200
 the Rinpoches continue saying that, "Turma can only be revealed through the meditative power of t

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:32.360
urtons.

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:38.280
 There are 108 great turtons and a thousand lesser turtons, all of whom are reincarnated masters of

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:44.520
 the 25 disciples of Guru Rinpoche. They are extraordinary awakened beings who receive

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:49.320
 teachings and blessings directly from Guru Rinpoche. They have incredible powers due to revealing

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:49.560
 their

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:55.700
 inner wisdom. Turtons are able to find the turma and reveal them without much difficulty. For

00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:56.280
 example,

00:23:56.280 --> 00:24:02.280
 after they've made the indicated preparations, the turma arrives to the turma spot,

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:08.840
 and sometimes a rock will suddenly open by itself, and then the turton will remove a container

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:09.160
 holding

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:15.880
 the turma. In addition to Dharma texts, turma can be ritual objects like badras, bells, purbos,

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:21.480
 statues, and blessed clothing. All of these items are used to establish a fresh, living connection

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:28.040
 to Guru Padma Sambhava, the Buddha, and one's innermost nature of mind. The turma texts are very

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:34.680
 unusual and awe-inspiring. Sometimes they are small yellow scrolls that cannot burn or be

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:40.360
 easily damaged. The teachings are written in symbolic Dakini script, which are not Tibetan

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:46.040
 language. Turtons can look at a few of these letters of Dakini script and through their inner

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:52.600
 wisdom reveal even volumes of teachings from them exactly word for word as Guru Rinpoche originally

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:58.520
 concealed them. There are many turma in Tibet, and they are very special. They even give protection

00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:04.530
 from harm to those who wear them. Even in present day, turmas continue to be revealed and practiced

00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:04.680
.

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:14.360
 So the second point for discussion comes from that last paragraph on page 86.

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:22.280
 The turma texts are very unusual. They are small pieces of yellow paper rolled into tight scrolls.

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:28.200
 If you put these rolls of paper into a fire, they will not burn. These teachings are written

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:33.800
 in a special language called the symbolic language of the Dakinis. These scrolls have just a few

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:38.360
 small signs, which are not Tibetan letters, but when the turtons look at the letters,

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:43.960
 they can transcribe long books from them. There are many of these hidden treasures in Tibet,

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:48.440
 and they are considered very special objects. Even in present day Tibet,

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:51.240
 great turtons continue to reveal the term of treasures.

00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:08.440
 Well, I read in the book, I think, Vajra Essence, and it's about the

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:19.640
 Dajjumtursar, the part that's, I think, more on Shimatha-type teachings. It was in the introduction

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:19.720
,

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:34.120
 I think, that said Dajjumlingpa, the turton of the Dajjumturma, said he downloaded the

00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:43.160
 term from the Dharmakaya. So I wondered how that could be explained for the, or how that fits into

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:52.120
 this description of terms. That process of how the turton discovers the object, and then from the

00:26:52.120 --> 00:27:02.040
 writing gets the whole text. Yeah, or, I mean, it sounded a little bit different to download

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:13.480
 something from the Dharmakaya, or to get a translation. I think that was the editor's commentary,

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:19.300
 although I don't think they necessarily had that word "download". But it's something we can relate

00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:19.400
 to

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:28.940
 in our own vernacular, in our own experience. That choice of word. That choice of words of download

00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:29.080
.

00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:38.920
 I think it relates, like, I mean, on the study guide, if you look on the back, there's the

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:44.760
 term lineage terms, and it just lists, I mean, in the chapter two, they talk about this, but just

00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:50.520
 those three types of terma, the earth or land terma, the mind terma, and the pure vision terma.

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:56.520
 So I think, in that case, the downloading from the Dharmakaya, maybe he was referring,

00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:05.640
 meaning that the mind terma, like, really, that's my guess. Did you know that if that terma is my

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:11.640
 terma? I think it's a mind terma. Yeah, I think so. That would fit. Because he had a, I think he

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:12.440
 had a,

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:19.160
 and they don't know if this is getting off course, but I think it's like he went to pure land and

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:29.000
 received the teachings there, I think. So, yeah, but I really, I'm resting in memory of.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:37.960
 Maybe it'd be good to elaborate on the difference between mind terma and pure vision terma, then,

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:42.360
 because, I mean, I remember hearing about mind terma before, but I'm not sure I'm really used

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:47.800
 to hearing it referred to as pure vision terma. I feel as though, I seem to remember having read

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:54.520
 that that's more when, like, there's like a vision of a deity that really comes and, like, speaks,

00:28:54.520 --> 00:29:00.760
 you know, speaks to teaching directly. That's what I, right? And that's the pure vision one?

00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:05.720
 That's the pure vision. Okay. And then the mind terma is just really, like, more like that

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:13.480
 Dharmakaya, and, like, really, that the teaching just comes. So rises. The causing condition comes

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:18.760
 the right moment, and then the teaching, or recollected, is sometimes people say the another

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:25.800
 version, where the turtan remembers their past life, and the teaching comes that way.

00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:39.960
 It's so beautiful how it's a, it's such an unbroken transmission, like you were saying,

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:46.760
 Guru Pauline Sambhava was the reincarnation of Buddhist Shakyamuni, and then his direct disciples

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:55.640
 reincarnated as turtons, and those turtons, and he specifically entrusted specific teachings for

00:29:55.640 --> 00:30:03.080
 specific moments of time to be revealed by those exact practitioners when the, you know, entrusted

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:09.400
 to the Dakinis and the guardians, and then when they were reborn in a different incarnation,

00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:17.240
 that time comes about. Like, one example, Jossi Shanthantayet, I think, and he received a

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:21.640
 terma prophecy, maybe you guys remember that better than I, but he said, "Oh, there will be,

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:26.760
 you know, there could be fires in Lhasa, you know, you should specifically reveal this terma

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:34.360
 at a specific time." That's what this protector told Jossi Shanthantayet, and he didn't really

00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:38.760
 pay much attention, he didn't really do that. And then there was fire in Lhasa, and there was

00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:45.320
 damage. Later, it said, he got another kind of prophecy, and it said, "If there's going to be

00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:51.320
 flooding, you should reveal the terma to avoid the flooding in Lhasa and essential to that."

00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:56.280
 Then he said, "Oh, this time, really, I'm going to do that." So he did, and he revealed the terma,

00:30:56.280 --> 00:31:02.360
 and he did the practices and specifically avoided the flooding which Lhasa was prone to because of

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:08.280
 its location, and totally dispelled that obstacle. That's because Guru Pauline Sambhava, I mean,

00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:13.800
 the point is that he knew exactly what was going to happen in the future and how things were going

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:19.240
 to happen. And the balance of the causes and conditions, too. Like, it's not, because even

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:24.360
 too, there's so many stories where, like, we saw someone for something where one little thing's a

00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:30.040
 little bit off, and not all the terma was actually even revealed, or, I mean, there's other

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:30.600
 instances,

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:44.520
 too, with the dark red and the blended, to some degree. Yeah, I just think we should be careful

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:49.160
 at that time, a little bit, with how many, it's such a big subject. And also, maybe,

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:56.360
 some people may not be as particularly knowledgeable of what we're referencing, so there might be a

00:31:56.360 --> 00:32:04.280
 lot. But, I mean, the take home point that seems like a terma is that it's specifically a teaching

00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:10.040
 for a specific time based on, you know, certain things have happened in those several hundred years

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:10.040
.

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:15.480
 At this time, when the barbarians come and they, or whatever, you know, you should reveal and

00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:15.960
 practice

00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:22.840
 this teaching, which is particularly good to dispel these obstacles at that time. It's just so deep

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:31.320
 and profound, you know, it's like, and anyone who doesn't believe in the vastest of the nature,

00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:38.120
 being so deep and profound, if they come in contact with the terma teachings, you know, it's like,

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:44.360
 you must dispel that, you know, to help. That's what everybody says, who actually sees someone

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:48.520
 reveal a terma, or you practice that teaching, and you see how it dispels the...

00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:56.920
 Just that blazing, like, the wisdom of Padmasambhava's bodhicitta, and that, and then these

00:32:56.920 --> 00:33:08.520
 practitioners of turtons, just that, yeah, so powerful, so blazing, so perfectly, like,

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:17.400
 medicine. I have a quick question. I'm sorry, but just to put, and then too, like you kind of were

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:24.280
 referencing too, I mean, not, there's the Dharma, this, like, pure, blazing, beautiful, just all

00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:30.760
 these teachings and these skillful, these practices, which really catalyze kind of that realization

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:30.840
 in

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:36.760
 one's own mind and heart, and then, like, this display in a way too, like in the terma tradition,

00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:43.320
 how you think Padmasambhava, Keshisojala, and the students assembled, just that, you know, through

00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:50.070
 their meditation power, you know, Keshisojala recalls the entire teaching, you know, this is

00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:50.440
 probably

00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:55.720
 days and days of teaching from Padmasambhava, right, or who knows their state of realization,

00:33:55.720 --> 00:34:04.520
 like I'm human, and she completely remembers flawlessly the whole teaching. She puts it in

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:11.400
 calligraphy on a scroll of paper, like the whole thing, and then through their wisdom and their

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:18.840
 meditative ability, their realization of how flexible all this apparent things is, like,

00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:25.960
 seal it, like, without moving from that cushion, like, all over these different locations,

00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:26.680
 including

00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:32.920
 space and, like, in the minds, and then, like you said, in the future, when these times would come,

00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:37.720
 where some of the Turtons would reveal them secretly, but then sometimes they would know,

00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:43.240
 they would know when to go and where to go, and they would actually say,

00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:49.400
 I'm going to go reveal this, and you read some of those descriptions, like in Blazing Splendor,

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:54.200
 or, you know, where people who very recently, they remember going and seeing, like, you know,

00:34:54.200 --> 00:35:00.840
 the rock, like, open up, and these really hot objects coming out, and, or, I mean, that's just,

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:06.600
 you know, I mean, just like that, where even for, there has to be, I guess there must be,

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:13.160
 there's connection with everyone and one's own devotion, but to think, you know, to just have

00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:19.240
 that connection, to actually see, for example, a rock open up, and, like, all these objects come

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:24.110
 out that are, like, so hot, they'll, like, burn, you know, burn cloth and things, you know, or

00:35:24.110 --> 00:35:24.520
 something,

00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:33.480
 that's not, not your ordinary thing for a lot of us, but not to mention

00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:40.760
 what's actually in that treasure, like, what, you know, it's not just the pump and circumstance,

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:47.640
 but just that gets the attention, and, like, for those with devotion even increases it more,

00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:54.120
 so I think for us to even think about that whole lineage of, like, what, how they, how it happened,

00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:59.880
 and how the term came, and it's very, for our own, like, kind of hearts and minds, kind of

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:09.160
 softening and opening and appreciating, so inspiring. One of the things I remember appreciating,

00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:15.320
 too, I was reading through Brilliant Moon, and it was, at one point, Dougal Kinsey was talking

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:15.560
 about

00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:20.910
 how he had revealed this one particular term, and he was, you know, he had seen them on this mand

00:36:20.910 --> 00:36:21.160
ala,

00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:25.960
 kind of displayed on a lake, and he was going into this, to this particular temple, and then he,

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:31.480
 he sees the statue, like, reaches up the sleeve and pulls up, you know, this temple, which is

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:34.680
 going, you know, it's like, that statue wouldn't have been around, so then you're really starting

00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:38.440
 to realize, you know, how flexible everything is. It's not like, you know, they, they went to a

00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:38.840
 rock,

00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:42.600
 and, you know, I mean, many times, yes, they did, but, you know, other times it's like, well,

00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:46.360
 that's not quite there yet, but we know what that's going to be in a certain place at this time,

00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:55.160
 you know, and it's just kind of, it's just, okay, wow, yeah, not really, really spectacular.

00:36:55.160 --> 00:37:04.680
 Well, I have to set a quick question, just kind of, you know, you hear a lot about the,

00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:12.040
 the term of being such a big aspect of thin Anima lineage, and I just wondered if anyone wanted to

00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:18.280
 say something about just how the other schools of Tibetan Buddhism see the terma, and kind of how

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:25.720
 they relate to it, and talk about it. I mean, I think it's, that seems as though there's terma

00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:32.930
 teachings in all the schools, but such a huge part of the Ninma school. Anyone have any to say

00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:33.160
 about

00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:39.960
 that? The only person I can think of that was not Ninma is the fifth Dalai Lama, is renowned as

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:40.200
 being

00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:47.400
 a teretan, but, but I don't know. I think this, I mean, I think Kimbo Sairam, which I recently said

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:57.220
 is only Saketrasen, one of his famous reincarnations, was a great teretan, all-way teretan, or I

00:37:57.220 --> 00:37:57.640
 forget

00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:04.920
 his name exactly, and that one of his, his great termas was a red tara, like a specific term of

00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:09.320
 practice of red tara, which now is long as Saketrasen, which is like so renowned for holding.

00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:17.480
 But maybe then I'll just, just with the other schools, how they view the terma teaching, the

00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:26.120
 terma lineage. I know that all of you is like Guru Rinpoche as being a profound enlightened

00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:32.680
 wisdom being, like a Buddha, and I mean, that's for sure. I mean, Rinpoche has definitely said

00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:38.840
 how they've all, of all these lineage masters have had some direct communication, and been inspired

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:39.080
,

00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:43.240
 if not directly personally blessed, by Guru Padmasambhava at some point in their lives,

00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:48.440
 whether it's in a vision or a dream or direct perception. And so in terms of that, like the

00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:54.680
 terma being the direct activity of Rinpoche, I think there's not any kind of a contradiction

00:38:54.680 --> 00:39:10.740
 there at all, for sure, between the lineages. I mean, it's...are they practicing terma? Do you know

00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:11.390
? Yeah, like the Tibetan book of the dead, quote unquote, everyone practices that, and that's a

00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:11.640
 really famous term of karma like that. So,

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:20.560
 many different vajra kalaya practices too, from the kamma and terma, all the schools. And then Raga

00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:25.400
 Aseng, like this great kamma, like all those schools, Nyingma Master, Tertan.

00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:34.350
 There are Tertans in the other schools, not just the Nyingma. Yeah, the kagyu too. I think the kag

00:39:34.350 --> 00:39:37.880
yu and the nyingma especially too, are especially closely,

00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:44.840
 many Nyingma and kagyu monasteries are both Nyingma and kagyu, including Riwacei, where Kenya and

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:45.240
 Virginia.

00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:50.680
 But there was just a quick side note on your question, like there was definitely a time where

00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:55.640
 there was a lot of false Tertans, which they said many people proclaiming that they had

00:39:55.640 --> 00:40:01.320
 "Oh, this is a terma" and everything, so then there was like a Jangung cultural, the great,

00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:06.520
 the first cultural in the 1900s, and other teachers wrote, "Oh, how do you distinguish between

00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:14.840
 authentic Tertan and a non-authentic Tertan, and terma and this and that?" Like one example,

00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:22.120
 Chogya Lingpa, one of the great Tertans of the 19th century, so renowned, close friend and student

00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:22.440
 and

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:27.300
 teacher of Jangung cultural in the first kensei, who was one of the greatest Tertans ever, you know

00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:27.880
,

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:34.360
 all different, seven types of transmission. Anyway, he helped. But he could hardly read,

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.640
 he said Chogya Lingpa. But he couldn't write, I don't think. Yeah, he couldn't write, so they would

00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:45.240
 come, but then he would reveal the most majestic, profound terma, sometimes in front of hundreds

00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:51.320
 of people, and so the cultural in kensei were just like, "This one, you know, he's just amazing how

00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:51.880
 he

00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:56.920
 can't write, but he's like total, you know, revealing his entire scope of the teachings."

00:40:56.920 --> 00:41:02.440
 But anyway, generally, I think they say like the practice is in the pudding. If that teaching leads

00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:08.920
 you to have like more bodhicitta, more wisdom, more compassion, all those different things,

00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:16.360
 it leads to that result, and that's a good sign that, you know, that it's authentic.
