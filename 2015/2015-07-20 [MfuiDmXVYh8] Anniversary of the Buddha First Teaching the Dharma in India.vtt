00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840
 In Sarnath, he gives the teaching, so tomorrow is that day, the Buddha gives the process teaching.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:12.600
 Teaching is concentrating on his enlightenment, or the result of his enlightenment.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:19.480
 When you get enlightened, you become Buddha, and then his realisation, his knowledge and experience

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.200
 begin to share to the others.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:27.560
 That is really teaching, so it is, as we all know, teaching is allowed, kind in the completion,

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.840
 how to make ourselves stronger and make beneficial to ourselves, all of that.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.880
 So that is really, tomorrow, according to very basic, and that is considered a very special day.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:45.640
 So that's it, and so according to a kind of normal schedule level, I think Buddha is just

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.880
 approaching Varanasi tonight.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.880
 [Laughter]

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.640
 And tomorrow he is going to walk in Sarnath.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.960
 And he will meet his disciples first, and they are also a little bit grumpy.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.620
 Grumpy, and the family says, "Oh, we are not going to accept him, we are not going to do this and

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:05.040
 that."

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.400
 But Buddha came foremost to see them, and also could give the teaching at Sarnath.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:18.880
 So all that big history, things are happening today and tomorrow, so tomorrow is actually the day

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.240
 that we are going to be looking at.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.480
 So we do the celebrations after the morning, after the morning, after the afternoon, after the

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.840
 afternoon.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.840
 Thank you, everyone.
