Shama means \"peaceful or calm,\" and tha means \"letting or abiding,\" so shamatha means \"letting the mind be peaceful.\" Shamatha is also known in Sanskrit as samadhi, which is also two words put together. Sama means \"motionless\" and dhi means \"holding,\" so samadhi refers to maintaining one's mind in a constant, unchanging state. For example, if you fill a bowl with water and do not touch it, the water does not move, it stays still. Similarly, when your mind rests single-pointedly, undisturbed by thoughts, it becomes calm. In this state the mind is concentrated and focused. This means that the mind does not move or change; it is solid like a mountain.

Vipashyana is a Sanskrit word made up of vi, meaning \"extraordinary,\" and pashyana, meaning \"seeing.\" Literally, it means \"extraordinary seeing,\" but it is usually translated into English as \"insight\" or \"supreme seeing.\" Vipashyana goes further than maintaining a calm and unmoving mind. In vipashyana practice you examine the mind and its source. By penetrating the surface level of thoughts and emotions, you see that their insubstantiality is the true nature of the mind. This is the practice of extraordinary seeing, in which you realize that everything arises from great emptiness, and that the true nature of the mind is unborn, unceasing, and free from concepts. When the mind relaxes in its natural state, all of the usual perceptions of solid existence are experienced as nothing more than a dream. This is the great equanimity free from mental fabrications. ... By shamatha one maintains the mind in the natural state, and by vipashyana one sees that all appearances are insubstantial emptiness.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.380
 Hello, welcome to the 14th webcast of the PBC Morning Dawn Study Group from Padmasamy Ling,

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:12.260
 Venerable Kemperomichhe's monastery in Sydney Center, New York. Today we'll be

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:18.400
 discussing chapter 14 of the Kemperomichhe's book, "The Buddhist Path," and the title of

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.640
 the chapter is called "Shamatha and Vipassana." So we'll begin with our usual

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.880
 opening prayers, and then we'll go into the discussion. Thanks so much for joining.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 [Music]

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 Pemakkara, the 25th king subjects, sozorna, yamda, the hundred churchons, and others,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.520
 lamasa, the kamma, and tourmalineages to you, I pray. The supreme tradition of the

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.240
 glorious Buddha, Padmasambhava, which is the essential, extraordinary view and

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.600
 doctrine of the early translation school, you keep alive and spread by the light

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.320
 of wisdom. Lord of Dharma, great tempo, I pray it shall ode his feet. In the palace

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.160
 of the old man, Darmadattu, the essence of all the Buddhas of the three times, the

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.640
 one who shows clearly the dharmakāya of my own mind, we pray to the honorable

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.000
 root guru, glorious root teacher, precious one, dwelling on the lotus seed on the

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.960
 crown of my head, hold me with your great kindness, bestow the accomplishments

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:58.440
 of body, speech, and mind.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:27.680
 So chapter 24 of Shammata and Vipassana begins on page 71 in the Buddha's Path,

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.760
 and I'll give a quick summary of the first half of the chapter according to the

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.760
 Kavirimaches. The Vibhiches begin by saying that all the different meditation

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.800
 instructions given by the Buddha have one purpose, to reveal the true nature of

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.280
 the mind. Which meditation instruction works for oneself depends on one's own

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.520
 mind at that time, but all the instructions work together to help us

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.760
 continue on the path until we reach enlightenment. When we first begin to

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.080
 meditate, most people find it difficult to rest the mind so his primordial wisdom

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.360
 can shine through. The mind is restless and constantly moving. First we sit with

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.800
 a good posture and remain focused. Although the Buddha taught several

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.960
 techniques for calming our grasping mind and revealing its wisdom nature, two of

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:17.360
 the best known are Shammata and Vipassana. Shammata or calm abiding is a meditation

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.240
 technique we apply to maintain our mind in a constant, unchanging state of focus.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.780
 Keeping the mind still and alert allows the natural clarity of the mind to shine

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.980
 forth. However, most of the time our minds are moving wild like a hurricane which

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.200
 isn't calming and oftentimes causes the body and speech to create a lot of

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.560
 conflict. Although it is difficult to calm the mind, it is possible with joyful

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.120
 effort and courage. Everything in Dharma and life requires perseverance and

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.640
 follow-through. It is important for us to believe we can achieve this goal and then

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.440
 to work towards it until it is accomplished with steady continual

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.320
 effort and enlightenment as possible. There are many stages of mental

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.920
 development and calm, but whenever we can maintain a focused awareness, for that

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.640
 moment the mind is calm and peaceful. This relaxes our body which relaxes our

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.960
 mind even more. To practice Shammata calm abiding, begin by sitting in the seven

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:18.080
 point posture of Buddha Vairachana or at least have your back very straight. Keep

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.520
 your breathing normal. There are two types of Shammata practice, Shammata

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.880
 with an object to focus and Shammata without an object to focus. Shammata

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.380
 with an object involves focusing on a physical object like a statue or

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:36.560
 crystal or visualizing an object like a sphere or a syllable. You can also follow

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.560
 your breath maintaining awareness of inhalation and exhalation as they happen.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.920
 When your mind wanders, bring it back to the object of your focus. Shammata

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:52.880
 without an object has no particular focus. It is just meditating on emptiness.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:05:00.200
 Here we'll go to the first topic question. When first learning to meditate, most

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.120
 people find it difficult to rest the mind so that the primordial wisdom can

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:09.120
 shine through. Thoughts continuously arise one after another like waves on

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.960
 the ocean and the mind is constantly moving. It helps to begin by sitting with

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.560
 good posture and then to remain focused. There are several techniques in the

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.120
 Buddhist tradition for settling the mind and uncovering wisdom. Two of the best

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.280
 known are Shammata and Deepasyana. Sanskrit word Shammata is made of two

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:35.480
 words Shama and Ta. Shama means peaceful or calm and Ta means letting or abiding.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:41.080
 So Shammata means letting the mind be peaceful. Shammata is also known in

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.320
 Sanskrit as Samadhi which is also two words put together.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:50.960
 Sama means motionless and D means holding. So Samadhi refers to maintaining

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:56.540
 one's mind in a constant unchanging state. For example, if you fill a bowl with water

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:02.320
 and do not touch it, the water does not move. It stays still. Similarly, when your

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:07.520
 mind rests single-pointedly undisturbed by thoughts, it becomes calm. In this state

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:12.380
 the mind is concentrated and focused. This means that the mind does not move or

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:16.700
 change. It is solid like a mountain. Maintaining the mind in a state of

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:22.680
 stillness results in clarity of the natural mind shining forth. That's from

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:27.240
 page 71, second and third paragraphs.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:35.760
 I had a thought kind of around the Shammata which was I was just wondering

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:42.880
 what people thought about kind of a calm peaceful mind is so nice to have but

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:49.160
 then also I know for myself sometimes I have a nice calm peaceful state of mind

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:55.080
 that maybe isn't so much Shammata. So like I don't know just thought if we all

00:06:55.080 --> 00:07:01.520
 just thought a little bit about it by kind of distinguishing how just how a

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:09.560
 peaceful calm mind relates to Shammata and how how Shammata brings us a step

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:15.320
 a step further. I'm not sure exactly how to phrase my question but just kind of

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:20.840
 like what's the difference between just being nice and relaxed and calm and

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:47.560
 Shammata meditation.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:08:06.560
 I think within that holding or like that focusing of the mind brings sort of a

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:23.720
 more of a clarity rather than just kind of like oh it feels good. Yeah in that degree of

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:29.280
 concentration aspect too. There's a certain it's just interesting how it's

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:33.600
 kind of so natural we can relax but then also like you said there's that dullness

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:38.360
 aspect but then that relaxing but then that other aspect of Shammata

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:49.240
 concentrating. I mean I think there's a big distinction between relaxing in our

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:54.880
 habitual patterns or relaxing according to like our grasping minds with all of

00:08:54.880 --> 00:09:00.160
 its preferences and then versus like relaxing into this natural state of

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:05.840
 awareness or non grasping mind and similarly with Shammata we can focus or

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:10.520
 fixate according to our habits on all kinds of pleasurable things. Usually when

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:15.260
 we feel relaxed we're definitely holding on to or running after a pleasurable

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:23.200
 object that will cause us to feel relaxed. But with Shammata as a meditation

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:27.640
 technique taught by the Buddha we're seeing that in the present moment we're

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:35.040
 holding on to an object that's actually going to help us lessen the turbulence

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:42.880
 of our surface level mind of all of its strong emotions and thoughts. So in one

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:51.460
 case like the more feel good kind of or concentrating kind of under pressure

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:56.960
 usually that's really related with just habitual mind just our our common way of

00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:01.480
 understanding things and of really kind of obsessing on things that we prefer

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:07.880
 versus like seeing through the habitual mind and anchoring our awareness on an

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:12.680
 object with the intention of like actually stilling the turbulence of our

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:18.520
 habits so they can become more refined so that then our non habituated wisdom

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:23.720
 awareness or non grasping mind becomes more apparent or shines through more

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:31.400
 clearly one thing to just think of it is the term relaxing you know a lot of time

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:34.960
 that I've spent with different people doing body work they this they really

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:38.880
 kind of hammer home that difference between what's relaxing and what's

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:43.520
 releasing because relaxing can be you know you know you kind of like just

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:48.280
 plop your body and just let everything go whereas releasing is you know very

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:52.400
 specific about your letting go of certain things you know in this case I

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:55.920
 think it's more you know echoing what droplets and you're gonna you you aren't

00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:00.040
 completely relaxing the body in Shama tell you you're keeping this posture so

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:05.280
 that way you can release a lot of that grasping and that clinging you know so

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:10.160
 just just that subtle word shift over into what exactly are you releasing and

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:14.960
 then you know exactly this droplets that you know we're looking at it's still in

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:19.200
 the mind you know for the purpose of you know what's our goal you know that that

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:23.820
 bodhichitta that refuge you know that that motivation so releasing anything

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:26.080
 else

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:33.360
 I think to the the relaxing aspect depending on how it is can be more

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:39.440
 actually like the possum of I mean I know we haven't really talked about that

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:45.880
 so much yet but like mutual kenrimic a one time he said his first experiences

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:51.520
 of like the nature of mind was when he was like a sheep herder and just like

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:56.680
 looking up at the sky you know like totally relaxed but open and you know

00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:00.960
 but anyway it's just that I think there's a difference between like relaxed

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:07.480
 like daydreaming and kind of just like what everybody's saying normal habit

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:24.120
 patterns and yeah and yet and then that kind of concentration where you really

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:29.600
 recognize when your mind has wandered from the object and you bring it back to

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:34.840
 the object that you're you know and you keep bringing it back to the object that

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:49.380
 you're focusing on I mean I think a big a big point to say with this is that this

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:53.000
 is we're all responding and like saying well what is shamatha now according to

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.920
 the buddha's teachings and then roommates are really clear is that a

00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:01.240
 shamatha practices or concentration practices existed long before the Buddha

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:06.720
 came into this world I mean there's many many kinds of concentration practices I

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:11.640
 mean in a more worldly sense like if we look at that those terms on the back of

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:16.520
 this study God there's the three types of concentration the first is worldly

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:21.800
 concentration which is just developing a capacity to remain focused on an object

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:26.440
 over a period of time and that could be something like hunting or it could be

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:32.360
 something like watching TV for six hours straight or being angry we did not have

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:38.480
 an object of anger in mind for a long time it's like any like concentration is

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:42.400
 saying irregardless of what the object is or what it cultivates in your mind

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:47.640
 like there's all kinds of we it's like a culture of concentrated activity in a

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:51.680
 way our mind is kind of jumping a lot too but it's just to say that this

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:57.140
 shamatha techniques are non-liberative techniques of meditation that don't

00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:01.000
 necessarily lead to enlightenment this like these concentration techniques

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.480
 existed long before the Buddha was around and they can lead to more

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:10.480
 temporary states of peace it says in that definition the concentration worldly

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:17.800
 concentration leads to a temporary state of peace because I think it stays in the

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:22.600
 habitual type of like habitual it works with our own habits it's not uncovering

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:28.720
 their deeper nature or refining them to be less turbulent but so we're all it's

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:32.280
 all and we're answering this question in the context of the Buddha's teachings of

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:36.200
 what is shamatha and a path of like enlightenment as being the final goal

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:42.720
 for ourselves and others it's a good point to make that distinction also from

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:49.680
 a practical perspective you can't hunt for long enough at a time to achieve

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:57.920
 full shamatha or you can't do some other activity that people might consider to

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:05.520
 be sort of relaxing generally you couldn't do it for long enough to for a

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:11.160
 length of time you need to meditate to get your mother

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:18.400
 and that's a time wise one of the renowned measures of shamatha is five

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:24.400
 minutes one of the renowned like kind of big milestones if you can hold your

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:31.800
 object for five minutes without wavering on any other thought that's a that's

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:39.880
 then you're starting to get pretty good so that's that's kind of a good you know

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:48.720
 because that rolls out a lot of a lot of things just as far as you know the goal

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:55.040
 is like really to place it and it's your mind and it stays on whatever you place

00:15:55.040 --> 00:16:00.840
 it on that shanata with focus and I thought to mention too that one of the

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:06.880
 most renowned ones too like you made the distinction between shanata as like a

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:12.160
 normal worldly technique in shanata and Buddhism but sometimes I forget exactly

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:17.920
 what they call it but oftentimes an object of shamatha is like the Buddha's

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:23.860
 face or an actual statue yeah the third eye spot of the Buddha and that's

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:29.280
 considered that's really a renowned aspect of you know the shamatha in Buddhism when you

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:34.120
 have a holy object of the Dharma that you focus your attention on as opposed

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:39.900
 to a rock or a flame with a breath or whatever I forget exactly what that's

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:46.000
 called it's interesting to it reminds me of a teaching I was once hearing where

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.640
 the particular teacher was talking about you know he was talking more about

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:54.720
 aspects of the mind and saying you know kind of you know how fast it is and you

00:16:54.720 --> 00:17:01.440
 know how if you have like a piece of metal and you've turned it into like an

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:05.640
 ashtray you know you're not you're not showing a lot of respect to it let's say

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:11.920
 you took that metal and made a statue of the Buddha you know for for you know

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:16.440
 other beings to kind of come and venerate you know that you're putting that that

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:19.320
 material to the with this beautiful intention and filling it with this

00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:23.080
 beautiful intention and kind of doing it it seems almost the same way with the

00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:28.080
 shamatha you could you or maybe more so the focus you know you could focus on

00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:31.940
 something you know it could be something like an ashtray and that focus is a

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:36.000
 disrespectful focus you're taking something that you no longer want and

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.160
 kind of flicking it into it or you using your focus in a way that that that brings

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:45.240
 those beautiful qualities that you know brings the you know people to have that

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:48.920
 that piece around you and things like that you know in that same way it's you

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:53.240
 know what's the what's the intention you're imbuing into your focus is another

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:57.760
 way of distinguishing and just that ability I think like you were

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:03.400
 mentioning that's such a major step and to have that stability of mind where

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:12.120
 we're not getting distracted or we can settle our mind on one object to focus in

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:17.880
 a in an open relaxed manner you know and then just as a foundation for all for

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:23.740
 looking deeper into you know maybe into the repulsion and things or like you

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:27.040
 know I mean River Shays mentioned this in the chapter too but the whole reason

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:35.000
 calm abiding it also it's kind of implying that we're just doing the

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.520
 opposite most of the time so just kind of that or like the metaphors to of like

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:46.360
 taming a wild horse you know like when you get the wild horse and you stake it

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:56.120
 you know to a spot you know just that it's such a major movement for us to

00:18:56.120 --> 00:19:00.560
 actually I mean of course when we try to do it we see but then it is possible

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:07.880
 yeah similar point I wanted to just highlight on page 73 in the middle

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:12.640
 paragraph there's just this nice really kind of short short example of the

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:16.860
 courageous effort that is so important when we're particularly I mean

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:21.160
 particularly I think when we're beginning to meditate and just kind of

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:26.080
 seeing how like the movements of the mind and the bumpiness and kind of maybe

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:30.760
 that maybe that tendency to think oh I'm never gonna be able to do this so like

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:36.240
 how can I possibly meditate and then so they're really talking about like the

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:41.360
 importance of patience and courage and joyful effort and just continuing and

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:46.440
 that you know recognizing the importance of it and that it's that it is possible

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:51.960
 you know so they give this example of a mountain and that you know a bodhisattva

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:56.520
 told some some people that if they really tried they could just totally

00:19:56.520 --> 00:20:02.160
 take down this mountain and reach enlightenment and so some people maybe

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:05.920
 tried a little bit and I said this is impossible and gave up and then some

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:09.480
 other people really worked for a long time and just kept going and doing it

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:13.480
 and doing it and then they did achieve enlightenment so anyway I mean it's it's

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:18.720
 a you know that metaphor of a mountain taking down a mountain I mean it's a it's a

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:24.760
 big it's a big task so I mean we have all of our I mean speaking for myself you

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:28.360
 know many like so many individual patterns and like chronic tendencies for

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:34.480
 so long that it may seem really difficult in the beginning but like just

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:38.800
 like really trusting and having that joyful effort and like you know this is

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:43.240
 really good something really important and seeing that value and moving forward

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:49.760
 is really so so important and again it kind of in each session session too we're

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:54.440
 kind of where we're looking at this one chapter but it's also all in this whole

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:59.360
 book and you know that aspect too of our practice we're kind of in a way our

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:03.380
 conversations been going maybe a little bit more around the mind element to

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:10.440
 Shimata because of course that's that's the queen beer but uh but then these

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:14.400
 other things like we've gone over those five supports of for our meditation and

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:19.040
 then the winds and channels I mean just setting up all those conditions as well

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:25.680
 as the view that's introduced early in the book just how all of those things

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:33.400
 are taking place here I wanted to also mention with Shimata is that it is about

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:38.200
 staying presently aware in what's happening right now there's a lot of

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:43.960
 type of focuses where you zone out and you're like one pointedly zoned out and

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:48.040
 that Shimata is about being able to intentionally place the awareness as

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:55.440
 you're saying Andrew and hold it there freshly presently vibrantly there for

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:59.840
 as long as you want and then the overall point of the shamata at least in Buddhist

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:04.320
 according to Buddhist teaching is so that we can and it doesn't mean so that

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:08.720
 we can just keep our mind fixated on something for years and just not have to

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:12.040
 deal with all the trouble in the world because we can kind of just only pay

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:15.440
 attention to this one thing but it's about developing that ability to

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:19.320
 intentionally place our awareness and really penetrate in and see something

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:23.520
 really thoroughly without our mind just having to just jump away and be

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:27.640
 distracted like so it's developing that capacity to intentionally place the

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:32.160
 awareness and then all problem-solving in all aspects of life or dealing with

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:38.000
 relationality relationships we have that capacity that we can then apply in these

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.760
 different circumstances and be more thorough more complete and how we're

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:52.560
 engaging with what's happening question I had is I know for many people it's

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:56.960
 beneficial to do things like walking meditation mostly because it's a way of

00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:00.840
 including it into like a way of going about your day you know as you're doing

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:03.920
 things as you're as you're going different places you know walking

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:08.040
 meditation is is something you can just say okay you know from you know I'm

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:12.520
 going to this next meeting but you know for all that space in between you know

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:19.760
 I'm allowing myself to just walk is is that a form of shamata or is there a way

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:26.120
 that shamata could be used throughout a day you know and you know in that in

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:29.320
 that way where it's just simply coming back to the breath for a little bit of

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:35.360
 time in in viewing our life of mindfulness or is it more distinct it

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:38.280
 means more structure

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:46.880
 maybe both okay holding an object in mind mindfulness is you're not

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:50.960
 necessarily holding an object in mind you're aware of what your mind is doing

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:55.720
 so it's kind of - shamata is a technique you're intentionally applying and

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:59.760
 mindfulness is awareness of what the technique is and am I applying it

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:04.840
 correctly right now or what am I doing right now the mindfulness but there's

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:11.680
 all kinds of objects like Zen koans if people try to hold that one koan in mind

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:16.360
 all day long even while they sleep like that's it is like a shamata style that

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:21.440
 breaks through into Vipassana seeing the nature of what is the inconceivable

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:26.720
 meaning of the koan breaking through the non dual mind but so that is a type of

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:31.040
 holding anytime where we have a good intention holding something in mind kind

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:34.840
 of trying to release our grasping then that's a shamata in the sense of Buddhist

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:41.080
 practice so even like if we say for people on our traditions we were just

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:46.720
 reflecting on sakes another piece of wisdom that sacred crochet you know

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:50.500
 advised us on and then holding that wisdom throughout the day would that be

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:58.320
 a form of shamata that you know would think so usually people are still when

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:04.080
 they do shamata as a practice okay I think to distinguish between mindfulness

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:10.760
 and awareness and alertness it's yeah it's related we should probably go to

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:15.400
 this next Vipassana section but it's related with the different levels of the

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:20.320
 teaching they both they use shamata and Vipassana in basic Buddhism and in

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:24.780
 Mahayana and in Vajrayana and they mean different things the definitions of them

00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:29.420
 and the techniques you use are different but so there's an overarching you're

00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:33.520
 holding an object that's a shamata thing you're releasing your holding and you're

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:37.160
 just relaxing your body that's the Vipassana side but it's different in

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:43.040
 each level of the Buddhist teaching so real quickly just our times going by a

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:46.280
 little bit I'll summarize the second half of the book which is more related

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:51.400
 with the Vipassana meditation teachings the kamurimchas they say the second

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:55.920
 meditation technique is called Vipassana or supreme seeing where you examine your

00:25:55.920 --> 00:26:01.240
 mind where the mind itself examines itself and its source to practice

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:05.280
 Vipassana you also sit with good posture and normal breathing then look directly

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:09.800
 to the mind itself when thoughts and emotions appear look for where they come

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:14.680
 from and where they go the instant the mind looks to itself the nature of mind

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:20.200
 is revealed then simply relax in this nature effortlessly confidently knowing

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:24.720
 there is nothing to gain or lose the true nature of mind itself is already

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:29.800
 present and cannot be changed maintain your awareness in its natural state and

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:33.840
 all the divisions we create by grasping on the thoughts dissolve integrate

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:38.600
 equanimity this nature completely pervades your mind and everything you

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:43.900
 experience Vipassana penetrates the surface level of mind where we grasp on

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:48.520
 to thoughts and directly sees the insubstantiality of all outer objects

00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:53.480
 and inner experiences we see that all distinctions between subject and object

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:58.720
 are ultimately empty of true existence Shyamata is the basis of Vipassana

00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:04.560
 the Vipassana goes beyond Shyamata since it transcends all duality Vipassana

00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:09.820
 leads to liberation when we maintain awareness of the natural state that is

00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:14.920
 effortless Shyamata the union of Shyamata and Vipassana those two

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:18.400
 techniques of Shyamata and Vipassana are taught both in the sutriyana and

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:22.800
 Vatriyana teachings of the Buddha though they're more related to sutriyana which

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:27.880
 includes basic Buddhism and Mahayana Vatriyana includes the sutriyana and is

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:32.680
 the complete teaching of the Buddha in Vatriyana Shyamata is taught as creation

00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:37.720
 stage visualization and Vipassana is taught as completion stage dissolution

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:42.400
 where everything is seen to arise from abide within and return to the nature of

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:44.740
 the mind

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:55.920
 so the second quote is from page 74 the first full paragraph and page 75 the

00:27:55.920 --> 00:28:01.520
 second full paragraph the second type of meditation is called Vipassana

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:08.160
 Vipassana is a Sanskrit word made up of V meaning extraordinary and Pashana

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:14.480
 meaning seeing literally it means extraordinary seeing but it is usually

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:20.760
 translated into English as insight or supreme seeing Vipassana goes further

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:26.160
 than maintaining the calm and unmoving mind in Vipassana practice you examine

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:31.600
 the mind and its source by penetrating the surface level of thoughts and

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:36.560
 emotions you see that their insubstantiality is the true nature of

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:42.160
 the mind this is the practice of extraordinary seeing in which you realize

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:46.920
 that everything arises from great emptiness and that the true nature of

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:53.880
 the mind is unborn unceasing and free from concepts when the mind relaxes in

00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:59.600
 its natural state all of the usual perceptions of solid existence are

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:04.880
 experienced as nothing more than a dream this is the great equanimity free from

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:10.840
 mental fabrications by Shimada one maintains the mind in the natural state

00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:16.040
 and by Vipassana one sees that all appearances are insubstantial emptiness

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:20.920
 success with one of these practices supports the development of the other

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:28.520
 but the result of Vipassana meditation is greater than that of Shimada

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:40.640
 so what's the main difference between Shammata and Vipassana?

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.840
 what is holding in one's not holding?

00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:51.440
 can you say more?

00:29:51.440 --> 00:30:00.320
 Shammata you try to hold an object, Vipassana you don't hold an object?

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:07.320
 you looked at who's holding it seems like maybe with Vipassana it's looking

00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:10.720
 more of course they kind of ventured here like for example thinking about

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:15.920
 thoughts looking at the nature of that thought well where did it come from where

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:21.040
 is it now or where the mind itself like where is the mind whereas Shammata

00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:29.120
 maybe we've gained some stability and everything's kind of in a natural flow

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:33.240
 and peace and everything and there's that stability and clarity of mind and

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:39.960
 able to focus but then maybe that object in a way and that was a question I had

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:45.560
 but I won't jump the gun a little bit but the way mind mind in a way is looking

00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:50.040
 back at itself or the essence you know the essence of all these appearances

00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:57.280
 that are shining forth just and maybe really tangibly seeing how it is

00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:03.320
 insubstantial whether it's through an intellect and logic or like a more direct meditative

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:04.800
 experience

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:10.920
 so it is letting go but there's that vivid quality too it seems

00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:23.080
 I think almost in like a basic Buddhism the in Mahayana too so all Sutra Mahayana

00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:29.160
 is the sense of a subject holding an object for in Shammata and as it's

00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:34.560
 talked about in those traditions in Sutra Anna there's a me sense of self

00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:39.520
 holding an object sense of not-self and the technique is the Shammata technique

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:44.160
 is always in that framework even if it's a more subtle object and still within

00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:51.200
 the sense of a subject apprehending an object and the passion aspect is is

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:55.920
 seeing before the mind filters or the before the mind holds itself into a

00:31:55.920 --> 00:32:01.520
 subject object framework or a duality mind before that happens or when that

00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:06.840
 happens then you apply one of these Vipassana techniques which say okay this

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:12.220
 is arising a thought or an object or whatever and you look the mind looks at

00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:18.240
 where is that thought where is that object where is this mind and Ravish is

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:22.080
 it really clear to say that Vipassana isn't a contemplative intellectual

00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:26.920
 investigation or analysis in Buddhism there's those three types of wisdom you

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:31.120
 hear the teaching you contemplate the teaching and then you apply the teaching

00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:35.640
 and with meditation so and so then you come to see the nature of relative and

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:40.000
 absolute truth directly without intellectual mind so here Vipassana is

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:45.000
 very clearly this third level of wisdom this direct experience of how your mind

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:51.680
 is before the mind filters into a subject object type of awareness so once

00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:56.520
 it's in that type of duality framework then the mind looks back to itself and

00:32:56.520 --> 00:33:03.080
 then right after it looks back to itself you release the looking the holding so

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:07.760
 because if we just investigate investigate then it's shamatha or it's a

00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:12.360
 contemplative type of wisdom it's still within duality mind but this Vipassana

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:16.720
 that's really clearly Vipassana was an extraordinary teaching of the Buddha and

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:21.200
 it's actually what didn't exist at the time before the Buddha came and that was

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:25.360
 the complete path shamatha and Vipassana together and it's the Vipassana part

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:31.540
 this liberative it sees the nature of the perceiver of the grasp of the holding

00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:39.480
 and releases that entirely. I had a quick question just practically with in terms of

00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:45.040
 like a beginner possibly starting out is it possible like say they read this

00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:50.520
 chapter and they're thinking about how do I start practicing this is it can you

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:55.800
 just start with Vipassana or is it like always do you always have to start with

00:33:55.800 --> 00:34:00.320
 shamatha I mean you know I asked that question too from in the chapter there's

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:05.040
 they say the technique for the Vipassana begins the same as with shamatha with

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:08.360
 good sitting posture and normal breathing and then you look into the

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:12.400
 mind itself so it's almost it's almost like you just jump into the technique

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:21.360
 I'm wondering if that's recommended or okay or depending on the practitioner just

00:34:42.400 --> 00:35:03.560
 like a very profound like essential sutra on the teaching of the three

00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:08.600
 trainings Sheila Samadhi rajna we there's a whole chapter we went over on

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:14.640
 this ethics concentration wisdom it's always it's always taught in that

00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:19.040
 sequence in the sutra on the teachings first you have to get your outer conduct

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:23.960
 well then you start to look in the mind in the mind which is still grasping mind

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:28.760
 starts to get more stable and calm with a concentration technique and then once

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:34.680
 it's more calm and stable then that concentrator the looker the awareness

00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:40.280
 looks at itself with wisdom so that's the Vipassana side a ripassana or

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:49.480
 Vipassana but in Tantrayana or in the in Vajrayana teachings of the Buddha they

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:54.960
 always talk about shamatha and Vipassana as a union so and this is a big

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:59.280
 difference like here at the very end said how concentration is usually talked

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:04.160
 about as creation stage and Vajrayana and then Vipassana is usually talked

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:08.960
 about a completion stage and then when we approach them as a unity then that's

00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:13.840
 called zochen or great completion stage so it's like a lot of concepts saying

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:21.160
 here but it's a difference is in the sutra ona where you go from duality mind

00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:27.680
 and then we kind of try to penetrate into egolessness selfless awareness but

00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:35.120
 in Vajrayana we start by trying to see the Nanda wisdom awareness or the of the

00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:38.800
 three samadhi's the first samadhi the suchness samadhi we start by trying to

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:43.400
 recognize emptiness right off the bat and then we try to naturally sustain

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:48.440
 that recognition when that's the shamatha side the shamatha side is just

00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:53.580
 sustaining the effortless sustaining of our awareness of the true nature but we

00:36:53.580 --> 00:37:03.840
 first see the true nature yeah and so that scene like within that larger

00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:08.640
 framework of the Buddhist teaching there's nine yana teachings the top six

00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:14.340
 yanas are all Vajrayana they're always based on sutra anna so even that way is

00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:20.640
 a gradual approach where we have to develop sutra anna first and then enter

00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:24.480
 into Vajrayana and as it's more traditionally taught like we would

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:31.040
 definitely have put in a lot of time in sutra anna practices before getting into

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:35.600
 Vajrayana but they say to the nature is though I mean just the Rinpoche saying

00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:39.640
 the chapter the nature is what it is it's already there right now we can see

00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:44.600
 it and like they give teachings public teachings where anyone can come and get

00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:48.760
 these instructions but in terms of really developing through that as it says

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:53.640
 here it takes time and like so even if we have these direct pointing out

00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:57.760
 instructions then to actually apply them in a way where we can sustain that as a

00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:01.880
 meditation practice takes a lot of time and a lot of obstacles come up and

00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:06.280
 because all our grasping has to be released so either way is for almost

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:11.840
 everyone have to be a gradual approach have to have a solid foundation then we

00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:19.480
 build release everything and I thought on a related point with that if you just

00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:24.280
 have shavata and novapasa man it's a small point but you could read you could

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:29.800
 even strengthen your ego in your sense of grasping even more and they said that

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:32.520
 happened a lot many people would get really good at

00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:36.320
 shavata and spend long time on that but then when they come out of retreat that

00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:42.440
 even more egoic and the strong than before because they didn't have the

00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:50.040
 vipassana aspect of turning back on the mind itself and see the insubstantiality

00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:55.660
 aspect so they just solidified the mind as being very sharp but it was a egoic

00:38:55.660 --> 00:39:05.510
 and then we also have that bodhicitta I mean that aspect of Mahayana too of bodhicitta where we are

00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:10.000
 thinking not only ourselves but all beings and equally with that becoming more and more familiar

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:15.700
 with the emptiness of everything

00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:21.640
 and I think another way to do the to talk about the distinction between shavata and

00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:26.480
 vipassana or this concentration and insight is with shavata we're really holding

00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:32.320
 an object at the exclusion of all the other things happening whether it's one

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:36.880
 object a small object and imagined object a set of objects we're holding a

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:41.680
 set of something and we're not paying attention at all to all the other stuff

00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:47.480
 going on in the world and around us so it excludes all of these things whereas

00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:53.240
 vipassana can be talked about talked about as as actually investigating the

00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:58.360
 relationality of the holder and the holding like you you're not you're

00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:03.080
 trying to expand the sense of relationality of the and so it comes more

00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:09.200
 to the flexibility of mind not just an ability to stay frozen or stay fixed but

00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:14.520
 to actually see the relationality between objects including the one who's

00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:19.160
 aware of the objects and so it gets into that emptiness is the definition of

00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:24.800
 dependent origination that it's all relational emptiness can be said to be

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:30.080
 just utter relationality like the realization of utter relationality and

00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:33.080
 if we're applying a technique where we don't see the relationality between

00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:38.560
 things or only looking at a small set of relationality me and that then it's a

00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:42.200
 big difference between shavata and vipassana

00:40:44.520 --> 00:41:00.400
 so it's good to say this is a big topic all the meditation instructions of

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:04.960
 Buddha Shakyamuni fit into shammata and vipassana all the levels of the

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:08.800
 teaching fit into those instructions we just have a short period of time to talk

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:14.240
 about these but even I mean even at the love beyond about Rihanna Zochen has its

00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:18.880
 own way of talking about shavata and vipassana or their union and if you look

00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:22.520
 at like heberimache's books like they're pointing out the nature of mind their

00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:26.120
 books they talk about all these different levels of instruction and

00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:29.560
 they say one level is there's a effortless union of shavata and

00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:34.600
 vipassana at a more gross level we make the division between the two and we have

00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:38.560
 to feel like we have to like combine them at an even more gross level we

00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:41.680
 might not even think that vipassana is true what do you mean it's all true

00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:46.200
 nature balanced perfect already so we really have to anchor into shavata first

00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:50.320
 but it just really depends on what our mind is there's all these techniques

00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:55.120
 that really talk about how shavata and vipassana fit together differently but it's

00:41:55.120 --> 00:42:00.800
 just I wanted to emphasize we didn't exhaust this topic by any means this is

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:11.520
 like so profound and the best way is to actually practice it I mean this but

00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:15.360
 that aspect to help you in the book I mean that we've given so much of the

00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:22.560
 view but like how special it is when we actually with our own minds sit down and

00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:27.720
 like remember as much as we can of the teachings after having thought about

00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:34.120
 them understood and really applied in meditation on whatever level we're doing

00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:39.580
 it but just that's such an important distinction too between but like Kim

00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:44.720
 but she says between letting letting it hover kind of all of this this

00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:49.600
 treasures hovering you know or this feast before us or someone's you know but

00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:55.980
 actually engaging letting it settle into our mind and heart we're actually taking

00:42:55.980 --> 00:43:02.400
 you know taking foot upon the path we've gotten all of our supplies and our

00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:08.280
 instructions and tips but then actually go ourselves

00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:29.000
 Oh, I see it's a young to me so soon so soon she took a margin in yes or did you
