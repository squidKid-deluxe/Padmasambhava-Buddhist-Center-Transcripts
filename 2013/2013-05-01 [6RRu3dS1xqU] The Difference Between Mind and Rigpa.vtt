00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.960
 "We discover that God is the natural nature, and then everything is that all the subject or the

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.040
 subject of mind is become compounded.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:26.960
 Compounded is changeable mind, and also the subject of the mind is compounded as mind.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:34.950
 That means mind is compounded, mind and rigpa has a difference in Dzogchen teaching as you all know

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.000
, you heard many times, I mean I heard you, we all heard that.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.210
 What that means, mind is changeable, mind is not reliable, today we can think something and

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.000
 tomorrow we can think something else.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:57.140
 The same thing, that means it's changing, it's not permanent, it's not, it's compounded, unreliable

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.040
, but rigpa never changes.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:08.990
 Rigpa is refined, the ordinary nature of the mind, as Grand Master said here, you've seen the

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.040
 ordinary nature of the mind, that stays all the time.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:23.420
 So when you see that the wisdom, when you, if you interpreted that all in the wisdom as mind, then

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.040
 it's compounded.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:43.190
 And also when you interpret it or when you think that emptiness is just blank, empty, empty. So the

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.590
 component mind perceiving the blank emptiness is not the true will, that is not the true

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.040
 understanding of the meaning.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:02:00.570
 That is what the Grand Master pointed out. And also the great blissfulness is not the blissfulness

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.040
 that developed through the sensations.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:11.200
 But it's the blissfulness of all in the natural quality. That is, but if you start or if we

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:19.950
 interpret the blissfulness as like sensation combinations, sense combination, then it is changing,

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.040
 it's going to change, it's not.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:31.200
 And similarly, after the nature we think clarity is just like clarity as light or as like kind of

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:41.040
 clear, that in all those are the dramas and levels of constructions, it is not nature.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:49.240
 Nature, it is just nominated by the consumption. Therefore, whoever thinks that way, the nature is

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.040
 like that way, they are not even close to the true nature.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.490
 It is. For that reason, therefore, you have to be contact with qualified teachers and receive the

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.040
 parent instructions from the qualified teacher,

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:10.970
 that which is only transmitted as all transmission continue, that. And without that, the kind of

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:16.040
 dry, intellectual analyzation cannot reach the true nature or behold.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:23.640
 True nature, same as like the bone with the blank person, cannot behold the poor clarity of the sun

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.040
.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:32.040
 Therefore, this is.
