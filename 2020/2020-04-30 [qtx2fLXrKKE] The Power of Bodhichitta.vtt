00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.580
 Thank you very much, everyone. Thank you very much. Again, welcome. Now, we are going to

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:30.180
 go over the unconvinced heart-enstruck teaching from the Mahatma Samye Ling monastery, which

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:36.120
 is the essential teaching of the Great Teacher, Buddha Shabtamuni, Narapemma Samma, as well

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:46.060
 as all the great masters following the footsteps of the Great Teacher of the Buddha Shabtamuni

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:54.940
 and all the lineage masters in their voice, in their wisdom, in their compassion. We are

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:02.940
 trying to also brighten up our practice, our journey, in our path. And for that very reason,

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.300
 we have these opportunities and situational circumstances, so therefore, again, we are

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:20.100
 going to reactivate our joy and appreciation, and as well as both each other and a few realizations

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:28.740
 of the way reality, all these phenomena are, and which is in the Vedayana teaching, and

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:35.680
 as well as all the great masters often mentioned, it is already enlightened status, all three

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:42.260
 regular status. So activating those, or at least then opening our kind of mind and heart

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:50.620
 toward that, not completely closed, that is very important for the practitioners. And

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:56.900
 with that, we followed again in the teachings. And the teaching is then, again, we can look

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:07.820
 to this teaching, but as actually I'm going, I'm putting all the teachings, all the practices,

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:15.540
 as all the great masters of the practice lineage, all the new masters, I'm trying to do that

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:23.900
 way, I'm following that, so as much as I can, which is three nobles, three nobles, and which

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:32.520
 also encompasses three essentials of the practices. And we have these three nobility, every

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.220
 practice

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:40.850
 comes, our practice, meditation comes in everything perfect for the purpose to getting

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:41.460
 enlightenment,

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:48.380
 to benefit all the living beings. Again, to get enlightenment, to benefit all the sentient

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.220
 beings, it looks like a very long journey to help or benefit the sentient beings, that

00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:00.740
 is not the case. We are going to help and benefit for all the living beings right now,

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:09.060
 with our motivation, with our intention. That is what is known as the Bodhi Chantals. Right

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:16.460
 now, we are going to really help and support to all the beings. And now, again, as I said

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:23.020
 yesterday, this motivation is the foundation, as in the teachings said, is the foundation,

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:30.420
 and that's something we also experience ourselves with. Everything what we do, we don't do

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:37.580
 without anything, we do without intention, we thought. Thought, about everything what

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:44.660
 we do, whether we are going by the Bodhi, or whether we are verbally talking, is all

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:55.340
 initiated from our mind. That this invisible mind, or emptiness mind, is instrumental to

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:04.460
 direct our every activities. Ask yourself, or ask ourselves, it's true or not. That's

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:10.860
 the greatest teacher, but that's it. It's true. We don't do anything blindly, or without

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:19.500
 our thought. Thought, everything is really performed with mind. Therefore, to activate

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:29.780
 our mind and reset our mind on the right direction, that is the beginning of the path, the journey

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:37.700
 to the enlightenment, and the journey to benefit, to help all the living beings by compassion.

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:43.820
 That is one. So, therefore, I also discussed a little bit yesterday about that motivation.

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:49.020
 First is joy and appreciation. I discussed a little bit, and again, of course, we can

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:55.220
 discuss those things in the later, as it comes in the teaching, that. And today, I'm going

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:04.100
 to talk a little bit about Bodhicitta. How we talk Bodhicitta. Again, what is Bodhicitta?

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:13.900
 Bodhicitta is a mind. Bodhi, jeta, is Sanskrit word. And in Tibet, it's translated ancient

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:21.260
 time, those great, fast letters, emanated, fast letters. They are not regular, fast letters,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.700
 trying to struggle, trying to put the word, you know, all those things, trying to put

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:31.420
 back into the, into the kind of play, the jigsaw balance, you know. Ancient, those great, fast

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:44.380
 letters, such as, all those who came in, in the eighth century, as the disciple of the

00:05:44.380 --> 00:06:02.540
 Lord of Amalsambhava, great abode, Shandharakkita, or the Bodhisattva Shandharakkita, and Kinshasa

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:12.660
 said perfectly, all the teachings that within that short period, which means, less than 100

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:19.740
 years later, complete the body of the entire teaching of the Buddha, is the whole, completely

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:25.420
 kind of transferred in the language of Tibet, that which is, kind of maybe, according to

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:34.220
 this story, developed just a hundred years ago, hundred years before. Structural, the

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:40.220
 way they translate it, the way they put them, words, this can be immediately, even throughout

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:50.300
 the centuries, modern time too, really, really carried an exactly meaning of the word, meaning

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:57.980
 of the teaching into the Tibetan foreign language at that time, and when you perfect it. They

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:05.340
 are not just also scholars, as did, they created practitioners. The teaching absorbed and

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:05.820
 completely

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:14.300
 out in their minds, they burst with love and kindness and compassion for all living beings,

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:25.020
 they don't want the earth humble and simple, with full of common sense, in full of knowledge,

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:31.420
 caring and concerning and respecting to all living beings, that's what this great

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:39.980
 emanated task letters, they translated this Bodhisatta of the Sanskrit word into Tibet,

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:47.180
 Jangchok ji sin, Jangchok ji sin, this Jangchok ji sin, or the Bodhisatta, of course,

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:55.260
 popularly use that terminology of the Sanskrit language in the Western English. In the English

00:07:55.260 --> 00:08:03.020
 it translated mind of the Buddha, or mind of enlightenment, mind of enlightenment, so that

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:12.780
 means what, body is enlightenment, and jeddah is mind, mind of enlightenment, or mind of the Buddha

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:12.860
,

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:20.140
 so that is what is what I'm going to talk today and remind you to all of us.

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:28.940
 You all know this body, you all receive this teaching, including myself, it's nothing again

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:37.580
 new, I'm talking, but we are again, as he said many times, we are friendly and reminded to each

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:37.820
 other

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:46.780
 that our transport, our travel, our beauty, this Bodhisatta is the essential teaching

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:52.860
 of the great teacher, Buddha Shaptamuni, the entire teaching of the Buddha Shaptamuni

00:08:53.660 --> 00:09:01.260
 is the best upon both each other, because Buddha teaching is teaching of non-violence,

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:11.500
 teaching of peace, teaching of the harmony, this teaching of peace and harmony, non-violence,

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:19.900
 it's not just only selected guru, small guru, for all the beings, every beings,

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:33.180
 they are longing to have peace and calm, peaceful, performant, really every one is longing,

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:39.180
 so that is what really, this teaching is complete on that, that is what is,

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:47.500
 so therefore, the entire Buddha teaching, the 45 years of teaching of the great teacher,

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:54.540
 kindness teacher, companion teacher, Buddha taught a teaching that is best upon this,

00:09:54.540 --> 00:10:04.220
 the Bodhisatta, then in the Mahayana teaching, it is intensified that Bodhisatta, that kindness

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:04.540
 thought,

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:14.700
 very intensified, they highlight in the teaching, because again, in order to reach enlightenment,

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:23.020
 order to become benefit for all living beings, as the great teacher, Buddha said, we have activated

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:34.780
 our Bodhisatta, and Bodhisatta is like precious jewel, what great, again master, Shanti Deva

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:44.940
 said in his teachings, Bodhisatta is like warriors, when you have that Bodhisatta,

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:56.620
 can defeat all the obstacles, the negatives, the negatives, Bodhisatta is like wish-fulfilling

00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:57.900
 jewels,

00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:06.860
 it must fulfill all the wishes, for us, for our own self, for all the beings, how long,

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:13.740
 until everyone reaches enlightenment, so it's everlasting wish-fulfilling jewels,

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:23.020
 that's this great Master Shanti Deva said, Bodhisatta is like acumen techniques,

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:31.180
 that the acumen technique, according ancient time in the teaching said, well changed,

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:39.340
 that acumen change, small amount of the acumen really changed the huge iron in the gold,

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:51.420
 this is like acumen, it will change our, this deluded, obscure duality, mind, completely as

00:11:51.420 --> 00:12:00.220
 enlightenment status, and Bodhisatta, this great Master said, Bodhisatta is like sail,

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:11.980
 okay, then it will attract everyone to the other shores, save, save everyone, everything save

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:19.420
 everyone, and then Bodhisatta is like fire of the end of the eons or the volcano fires,

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:24.620
 that both will burn instantly all negatives,

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:34.780
 negatives and obstacles, so therefore what this great, great Master Shanti Deva said,

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:45.180
 for that reason everyone must be cherished, uphold this precious, the unique nature and beauty,

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:52.300
 that is Bodhisatta, this Bodhisatta is not just only have the select group heads,

00:12:53.100 --> 00:13:00.540
 we all have them, every living we have the intelligent, only one we have to do,

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:06.860
 we have to activate it with recognitions, we have to acknowledge ourselves,

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:15.340
 so now what is that Bodhisatta, what is that Bodhisatta, what is the nature, what identity of

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:25.420
 that Bodhisatta, in the teaching said, Bodhisatta is loving kindness, compassion with that thought,

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:34.060
 loving kindness, compassion for all living beings, with that intention I like to get enlightenment,

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:44.300
 I like to get, discover my own nature, and for that reason I'm going to also take care of Bodhis

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:44.540
atta,

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:50.620
 whatever the obstacle one may interfere of my Bodhisatta, I'm going to avoid,

00:13:50.620 --> 00:14:01.580
 I'm going to not going to go under those interference of the obstacles, obstacles,

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:10.060
 that is the Bodhisatta, so now that way again to simplify, Bodhisatta is loving kindness,

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:19.580
 Bodhisatta is compassion, and Bodhisatta is wisdom, wisdom, as I said yesterday, what great master,

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:29.740
 great teacher Murugamma Sambha said, these three are minds of Buddha, that is Buddha,

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:37.740
 actually Buddha, what is Buddha, the enlightenment, this love, the compassion,

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:44.780
 wisdom, this is really Buddha, this is Buddha, so where is that love and compassion, wisdom,

00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:54.460
 is within our nature of the mind, within your nature of the mind, and within the nature of the

00:14:54.460 --> 00:15:06.380
 mind too, we all have this, now we have to activate this, this spiritual time, our this nature of

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:06.460
 the

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:13.340
 mind of Bodhisatta for loving kindness and compassion, wisdom is shadowed, our caste,

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:22.460
 by all our habitiveness or the deluded, this which is known as obscurations,

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:33.820
 obscurations, obscurations is also nothing but is our mind, so now we have to use power of the

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:40.860
 knowledge in the identity of our own call it or natural call it, the mind going to defeat in a

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:52.780
 clean way our own minds in purity, this is similar using the technique as homopathic techniques,

00:15:53.820 --> 00:16:03.820
 using what in the teaching said, pile will stop the pile, iron will cut iron, okay, mind will

00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:04.380
 overcome

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:11.100
 the mind, we don't have to look situation in circumstances other conditions from outside,

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:21.180
 it's more powerful, more effective, more practical, therefore we have to activate our

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:32.220
 this beautiful intention, beautiful intention which is now the Bodhisatta, again loving kindness

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:41.180
 compassion, why we need love and compassion, first level love and compassion as I said already

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:50.300
 is the nature of the mind, nature of the mind, negative emotions are not

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:55.500
 nature of the mind according to the teaching of the buddhas and all the great masters,

00:16:55.500 --> 00:17:04.460
 they are obscurations, they're not nature of the mind, loving kindness, compassion, that nature of

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:13.020
 the mind, it's all the nature of our mind, it's the buddha nature, wisdom and compassion,

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:20.780
 compassion, so it's our nature, when we touch therefore when we touch with our nature, also

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:30.060
 what it does, it brings ourselves more calm, peaceful happiness because in nature, it's authentic

00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:38.780
 nature, when we touch the unnatural quality of the mind and then what it brings, suffering,

00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:46.460
 sadness, stressful, anxiety, worry, then we need to become stronger, anger, jealous,

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:54.940
 hated hopes, all those are coming, what it does, when we feel that, when we have that,

00:17:54.940 --> 00:18:02.380
 what are we feeling, we're sad, we're suffering, we're closed, we feel lonely, we will despair,

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:13.900
 we're isolated, isolated because it's unnatural, unnatural, pollution is the pollution created

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:21.420
 entirely our environment of the beautiful mental states, but is that creation is nothing but our

00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:28.780
 own creations, maybe somebody that created their consequences externally but fundamentally really

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:37.340
 activated by our own self according to Buddha's teaching, so therefore this loving kindness,

00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:44.140
 compassion is we're touching to the nature, our essence and that how we can touch it is

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:50.220
 again in the teaching said love and compassion, you should feel love and compassion to all the

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:58.620
 living beings, everyone what they want, be happy, they want to be peace, they will be comfortable

00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:07.340
 and then relax, calm, everyone but yet no one is achieving that goal completely,

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:14.940
 always struggling, always like kind of looks like climbing up the sandy mountains,

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:22.540
 push steps goes up and push steps goes down, that is going on and on for a long time,

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:29.420
 according to the greatest teacher, we've been doing that since the biggest times

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:38.860
 and always we challenge and clarify between hope and fears, one after another, we're hoping

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:47.100
 something but then something always appears, one after another, so that is really the how the

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:56.460
 situation of almost every living beings are that for that very reason, then in the teaching said

00:19:56.460 --> 00:20:05.180
 feel great compassion, all these living beings, we have all the similar intention, similar desire,

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:15.500
 similar wishes, therefore feel love and compassion, when we do that in our heart and mind, what we

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:15.500
're

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:22.860
 doing, we're revealing our rich treasure of the nature of the mind, the treasure of the nature of

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:30.940
 the mind is infinite, endless, when you reveal more love, it will come more love and more

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:31.980
 compassion,

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:40.210
 the resolved more joy, more peace, more harmonious, more friendships, everyone more friendly,

00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:41.020
 friends,

00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:47.100
 I will like to sorrow many friends, we should increase the more loving kind of the computer

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:52.860
 or we should activate the body together, it will bring more friends, more friendships,

00:20:53.740 --> 00:21:03.180
 more fulfillment, all that, so this is what really therefore we in the teaching said we should

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:03.580
 really

00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:09.660
 feel more love and kindness, compassion, plus in the buddha teaching of course you all know, no,

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:21.660
 there is all the living beings being our parent, everyone since the biggest time we came in this

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:31.180
 samsara, always we need parents and of course in the buddha teaching mentioned there is four

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:31.660
 different

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:40.460
 ways that we take the birth in this samsara, those are the four births, miraculous birth or the

00:21:40.460 --> 00:22:01.260
 instant birth, aid birth, warm birth, warm birth, and then mostial birth, n-o-i-s-t-u-r-e,

00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:14.220
 mostial birth, and what are those? Instant births in the buddha teaching

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:24.780
 measured happening in the hell realm and God's realm and maybe, not maybe, in also sometimes

00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:33.500
 in the part of states, those are known as instant births, but God's realm, hell realm, part of

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:33.500
 those

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:41.180
 are we don't see, ourself, human are we don't have capability to see that, maybe certain people

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:47.740
 have the capability or something like that, but otherwise we won't see, but it is there according,

00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:57.740
 then warm birth is human birth, most of the time and as well as animals are warm birth, many of the

00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:08.220
 animals, and then mostial births are also animals, so many insects are born according,

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:16.770
 buddha's name most choose, birds, most of them, so that's it, aid birth is also many kind, it's

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:17.260
 like

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:26.220
 such as animals, all those like all, yeah many animals, aid birth, those are known as, so even

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:35.580
 there is four different ways, you take the birth, but the aid birth as well as as warm birth need

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:44.220
 barren most of the time, barren, and so therefore in the teachings said, how many times we talk

00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:52.380
 birth in this samsara, from the biggest time, great master Narayana said, and we put all this

00:23:52.380 --> 00:24:03.100
 full earth of the world as like clay and trying to put the, the rolled small earth or earth like

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:12.300
 as a clay, from that clay we started rolling the clay as a size of the juniper seed,

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:20.860
 if you start, if you're trying to build, make the build as side of the juniper seed from the

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:29.340
 clay of the entire earth, still the clay of earth is not enough to put the number of our lifetimes

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:37.260
 that we talk in this world and had the parents, still is not enough, it's short, short,

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:46.700
 can you imagine how many times we talk the birth in this this world, most of that time,

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:56.860
 most of that time the parents are kind, all kept, all that they kept us, nourished us,

00:24:56.860 --> 00:25:06.380
 protect us, booking the bird, bird and so forth, really they're so kind, they have the support,

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:13.420
 they did their best, their best, they're not enlightened beings, sometimes they make mistakes,

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:23.820
 but nevertheless they did their best to their childrens, their childrens, their loved ones,

00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:31.500
 all the parents, look to the animals, how much they're walking for their babies,

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:40.620
 every cover abilities, whatever they have, they spend time, cover ability to provide their food

00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:50.380
 and make a nest, nest and then human world too, it's just, it's not just really one time,

00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:57.660
 every time like that, so therefore in Buddhism, of course you know these things, I'm not talking

00:25:57.660 --> 00:26:04.540
 something new things, therefore now we, I've got some kind of knowledge in the Muslims hiding in

00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:10.540
 my heart and the body, for that very reason I'm going to really help to all these living beings,

00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:15.580
 I'm going to remove their suffering and the difficulty troubles, I'm going to help and

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:23.660
 support, to ignite their Buddha nature, so they can be benefited and well-accepted to go through

00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:28.620
 the samsara in the world and not just to go through the samsara where they come, but get

00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:29.740
 enlightened,

00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:39.020
 totally free from the old that, that's troubles in this challenge, challenges, therefore I'm going

00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:45.500
 to really develop the body together and I'm going to have more, more equipped to help to all the

00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:52.460
 sentient beings, for that reason I'm going to get enlightened, when we have to get enlightened, we

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:57.500
 become the Buddha, you have more cover ability or when you have become the great bodhisattva, we

00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:57.660
 have

00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:04.620
 more cover ability and more tools way to help, because our wisdom is more stronger, more shiny,

00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:10.300
 our more skillful meaning, more techniques, the cover ability to breathe our loving kindness

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:18.860
 completion into the action, that's how I move, move up, most of for that reason that I'm going

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:25.180
 to get enlightened, for that reason what in the teaching said, by completion you're projecting

00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:31.340
 for all the living beings, by wisdom you're projecting to get enlightened and combined

00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:39.420
 target, wisdom and compassion, goes to target as like inseparable, as which is sometimes

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:48.220
 named skillful meaning and a wisdom, combined target, that individually will go, fly very high

00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:56.540
 and defeated all the obstacles in the peaceful manners,

00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:08.300
 they truly they will become the winner, winner of the samsaras, and that's what in the teaching

00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:16.220
 offering said, said the warriors, conquerors, name of the great teacher Buddha has many different

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:25.340
 names, conquerors, conquerors, dattagatas, dasgongs or whatever, and then as well as conquerors,

00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:31.660
 what means conquerors, it's not a conqueror that would defeat the world, commonly in the samsaras

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:40.620
 or defeated the enemies, but this sort of enemy is, the obscurations, negative emotions are

00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:48.940
 obscurations, they're not just obstacles in the obstacles for a short time, but they've been

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:58.300
 obstacles for us for the biggest times, for a long time, they're constantly making obstacles,

00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:07.580
 not just one day, two days, or a few hours, or once in a while, they are constantly obstacles,

00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:16.380
 but that is defeated by the power of the bodhicata, therefore they are known as conquerors,

00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:27.900
 jaravas in it, so that is really the bodhicata, now this bodhicata, where you develop bodhicata,

00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:34.380
 where we develop the bodhicata, those are known as, then there's three different, different kind of

00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:44.300
 divisions, I again highlight those divisions, and they pose three bodhicata, and that three

00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:52.060
 bodhicata, a chord in the intention, calling, and a willingness of the practice of the body,

00:29:52.060 --> 00:30:00.540
 or so body, body, body, bodhicata, more generally, I should say that, when you take the bodhicata

00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:07.420
 vows, when you take the bodhicata vows, with understanding and the significance and benefit

00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:15.580
 of the bodhicata, then there is, you can take the vows, you receive the vows from the linear

00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:16.620
 masters,

00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:25.340
 linear master who holds bodhicata vows, or with bodhicata vows, not just hold hold,

00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:34.540
 also who practices that, practicing the whole of the lineage of the bodhicata should receive

00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:43.180
 bodhicata vows, if situation and a sacrifice allow that, even is not happened immediately,

00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:49.980
 still, then we should practice this, when moment we develop that attitude, the bodhicata what I

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:57.090
 said to you, and of course you already know, that time, what in the teaching said, that

00:30:57.090 --> 00:30:58.460
 individually

00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:09.660
 name is changed, that moment, that individually is known as bodhisattvas, bodhisattvas,

00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:16.940
 that is a Sanskrit word, and now that translated into to be scientific, simple,

00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:23.260
 and it translated as an English, courageous one for the enlightenment,

00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:31.260
 that is the bodhisattvas, bodhi is enlightenment, sattva means courageous ones,

00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:38.780
 now maybe you wonder why we need courageous, courageous we need it because we are going to

00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:46.300
 benefit all living beings, we are going to reverse our attitude of the way we think,

00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:54.460
 until now from the biggest times, from the biggest time until now what our attitudes,

00:31:54.460 --> 00:32:03.340
 always a thinking to one's own self, one's own self or one's kind of relatives and belongings,

00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:13.100
 that, that is known as kind of self-centered mind, according Mahayana teachings, self-centered mind

00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:13.100
,

00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:19.420
 that we've been normally thinking all the time, and every sentence brings a thinking,

00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:28.380
 but that didn't achieve the goal, but really we want, always struggling, always it just fails,

00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:36.540
 and all that goes on and on, that didn't change, so now when we develop the bodhisattva in our

00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:45.260
 heart, that moment we reverse that attitude or intention from our heart, we think in certain

00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:54.220
 beings all others are more important than even ourselves, some of them, and that is known that

00:32:54.220 --> 00:33:03.500
 therefore is courageous ones, courageous one, not the timid ones, timid, self-centered mind

00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:11.580
 makes more timidness, more sharing our attitude, and our views become more closed, more tight,

00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:22.380
 when you have the body that is broke, our heart is open as the skies, our mind is open as the

00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:23.020
 spaces,

00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:32.140
 and as far as our mind and heart opens, that part, love and kindness, compassion, wisdom shines

00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:38.860
 freely every living beings, that's what is called courageous ones, how long they're going to shine,

00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:46.220
 not just the only short time, but until every living being reaching like that, until that love

00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:55.180
 is going to shine, and it's going bright up that, for that is courageous ones, and during that time

00:33:55.180 --> 00:34:01.740
 even your heart is open and bodhisattva is so open and flowing every direction, yet all the

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:09.340
 sentient beings are not necessarily going to immediately accept their situations, therefore

00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:17.660
 we're not going to feel timidly disappointed, our love and compassion is unconditional love,

00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:25.980
 unconditional compassion, not expecting something return, or not expecting something kind of

00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:36.220
 acknowledgement, it's forever, as like open sky, as like sun, sun shines every direction,

00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:44.540
 even nobody says thank you, or I know that it shines, it clears, brilliant,

00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:53.340
 sky is open, it is blowing, the earth is strong remain, as like whatever it is,

00:34:54.460 --> 00:35:01.980
 like that, the compassion bodhicitta remains, therefore is known as courageous ones for the

00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:08.700
 enlightenment, so that is now really bodhicitta, once we develop that bodhicitta, or when we said,

00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:18.060
 then according to the attitude of the individualist, there is three bodhisattvas or bodhicittas,

00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:25.100
 those are, again of course you all know this, but I'm going to list that names, and

00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:39.100
 king-like bodhicitta, sailor-like bodhicitta, and shepherd-like bodhicitta, king-like bodhicitta,

00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:46.780
 sailor-like bodhicitta, king-like, I think you, I'm sure you know that, but sailor,

00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:59.500
 s-a-i-l-o-r, sailor, sailor-like bodhicitta, then shepherd, I think you understand what I'm talking

00:35:59.500 --> 00:35:59.500
,

00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:11.340
 shepherd, s-h-e-r-p-p-b-b-e-r-t shepherd-like bodhicitta, those are the different kind of how those

00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:18.380
 individualists develop the bodhicittas, and what that now, these examples, what does that mean?

00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:25.820
 The teachings say it, king-like bodhicitta, those some bodhicittas, they are intelligent,

00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:32.140
 oh I like to, I like to benefit the help of all the sentient beings, but first I'm going to get

00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:37.180
 enlightenment, then I'm going to help, that didn't mean I'm not going to help anyone,

00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:42.220
 but they are kind of a little bit projecting, a little bit more to get enlightenment first,

00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:47.500
 and then going to benefit the help before the sentient beings, so that is known as

00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:54.700
 king-like bodhicitta, and what would that mean? Again it just says the kings, generally king or

00:36:54.700 --> 00:37:01.020
 the queens, when those people in the royal palace, both they have to be comfortable, they have to

00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:01.260
 be

00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:07.020
 settled, comfortable in a royal country, e-copyright, once that happens, then they're going to

00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:14.050
 help you, they're going to help you to the subject, so that use the example as like king-like bodh

00:37:14.050 --> 00:37:14.620
icitta,

00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:22.700
 bodhicittas, those are the king-like bodhicittas, still like bodhicittas, I like to help all the

00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:28.620
 sentient beings, I like to get enlightenment, but same time I like to help to all the sentient

00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:29.100
 beings,

00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:38.620
 so I and all together, I like to get enlightenment, and that is the cell-like bodhicitta,

00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:48.300
 why again in the example, for example, when the cell takes us in their boat, cell him or herself

00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:56.060
 were also in the boat, and there also is taking us or the travel passengers also in the boat,

00:37:56.060 --> 00:38:04.700
 and together they went or they showed, so those are named, for example, as cell-like bodhicittas,

00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:12.780
 and now the next one, third one, is shepherd-like bodhicitta, shepherd how shepherd does in the

00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:20.220
 teaching said, and of course you, we all know that, shepherd goes up the animals, and first the

00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:20.780
 shepherd

00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:28.140
 will put the animals on the grassland, nice safe places, nice areas, there's no kind of, like all

00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:38.140
 those, those wild beasts were, beasts will disturb the animals, so it puts, kind of, nice areas,

00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:46.940
 looking safe, safe, put in safe places, and then shepherd him or herself, finally going to rest,

00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:56.060
 let's sit down on the ground, and similarly these bodhicittas or the bodhisattvas, they like to get

00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:56.060
,

00:38:56.060 --> 00:39:03.660
 everyone get enlightenment, before they get enlightenment, and therefore, that's for that

00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:12.700
 reason, use the examples of as shepherd-like bodhicittas, those are the different kind of

00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:20.300
 willingness and attitude, how those individuals, what those great bodhisattvas individually,

00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:27.580
 intentionally, and that kind of, measure with, with those different terminologies to highlight,

00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:35.980
 but everyone, doesn't matter what, every bodhisattvas, and bodhisattvas, I have the bodhicitta,

00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:44.140
 bodhicitta, and to benefit all the sentient beings, to every living beings, when the moment we have

00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:49.820
 the bodhicitta, and what those are known as bodhisattva, all other names in the buddha's

00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:56.380
 teaching, in Mahayana teaching, many a time said, noble son and noble daughters, they become the

00:39:56.380 --> 00:40:04.700
 noble, we all become nobles, moment we develop the bodhicitta in our heart, before that we're

00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:13.340
 old, but now we have become the noble, because we touch our noble, of loving kindness, compassion,

00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:21.100
 and wisdom, that is being chined, chined, benefit to ourselves, benefit to all the beings,

00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:21.980
 therefore,

00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:29.580
 it is also named noble son, noble daughters, so that is again, really about the bodhicitta,

00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:36.780
 and then again, I will continually go over this meaning, and which is really so important,

00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:43.420
 bodhicitta is entirely bodhicitta, is best upon bodhicitta, but then, particularly in Mahayana

00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:51.260
 teaching, Vaidhyana teaching is best absolutely on bodhicitta, and for that reason, what is in

00:40:51.260 --> 00:40:57.900
 teaching said, if you have one things, one practices, that will be enough to get enlightened,

00:40:57.900 --> 00:41:03.900
 and benefit all the living beings, that is bodhicitta, if we don't have one thing,

00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:11.580
 which is bodhicitta, if we don't have that, no matter whatever teaching you have, whatever

00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:19.260
 practice you do, all the practices have become best upon all kind of self-important best practices,

00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:26.620
 it won't go far, far, and it really won't work what we're thinking to do, and for example,

00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:32.220
 Raziel teaching of the dzokchim, all Mahamadharic teaching, all it won't work, according to the

00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:39.340
 teachings, therefore, to make everything blended in perfectly, beautifully, all practices go

00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:47.020
 far from it, that is bodhicitta, bodhicitta is, if you use the examples of the modern time,

00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:57.420
 bodhicitta is lunch bed of space ships, space ships, lunch bed, and bodhicitta is fuel for the

00:41:57.420 --> 00:42:05.980
 space ships, without this, we won't go any further, and all again in S.N.T. teaching said,

00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:14.380
 it's all kind of, almost the best of the, the kind with self-important things, it won't go

00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:19.900
 far, and that is my talk for today, and thank you very much again for participating, and thank you

00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:25.420
 so much everyone for participating, thank you, thank you, thank you. Now we do, again, short

00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:26.140
 meditation.
