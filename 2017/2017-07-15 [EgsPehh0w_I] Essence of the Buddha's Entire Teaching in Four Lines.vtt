00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.310
 Many of you have that. In the Dharmapala practices, at the last, what we say, I just talk this part

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:07.520
,

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:25.920
 part here in the Tibet, where I say, in that is said, in English words, do not engage any

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:37.120
 negative activities, practicing with you, perfectly, and completely subjugate your own mind,

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:47.120
 this is the teaching of the Buddha. According, I think if you have this Dharmapala, it's the

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:55.760
 last page, it's the last page, because I'll talk and you sit here. So that according to many great

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:02.880
 masters of the teaching, this is the really convinced teach, the entire teaching of the

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:10.640
 Buddha Chaktamuni. Buddha Chaktamuni gave what often used to call eighty-four thousand of the

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:18.320
 teachings. They gave a lot of teachings, eighty-four thousand teachings. And those teachings are

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:27.280
 so can summarize twelve excellent teachings. And that twelve excellent teachings summarize

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:35.040
 in the three basket teachings. And I think many of you, those three baskets are Vinaya,

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:44.240
 Sutra, and Abhinavana. Why is it called basket? Because Vinaya is not just one Vinaya, Vinaya,

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:52.720
 Vinaya. It has all the richness of the teaching. So that is a metaphor, basket,

00:01:52.720 --> 00:02:01.280
 fooled with Vinaya teachings. That basket is fooled with, what means Vinaya? Vinaya means

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.080
 discipline,

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:13.680
 discipline. So that basket is filled with discipline teachings. That is what means basket.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:22.320
 And then same way, the Sutra basket. What that means? Again, Sutra is condensed teachings,

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:28.160
 more summarized teaching. More summarized teaching is also not just one item. There is

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:36.160
 many, many beautiful, again teaching. More emphasizing on the concentrations. More meditative

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.760
 techniques filled with that, that basket. So therefore, it is called the basket, named as

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:49.760
 metaphor. And the third one is Abhinavana. Abhinavana is again, of course, old Sanskrit word. But

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.800
 Abhinavana,

00:02:50.800 --> 00:03:01.840
 what means are the, Abhinavana means, means as seen exactly as it is. Or phenomena seen

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:11.200
 exactly as it is. Is, exactly on the direct perception status. So that what means, that is

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:17.920
 actually wisdom teaching, wisdom. So this is not just one kind of item of the wisdom teaching,

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:24.960
 but there is a variety of exploring of the wisdom teaching, that filled, that basket filled with

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:32.640
 that. Therefore, it is called Abhinavana basket teachings. So those are kind of three, three

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:39.440
 fitakas or three basket teachings in the Buddhism that. And now that whole three basket teachings

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:47.360
 summarize to this teaching. For everything is really teaching. So if the whole Buddha's teaching,

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:55.040
 every look, what is teaching song? Teaching song. Teaching on how to avoid negative activities.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:01.200
 Negative activities. Teaching on how to perform the positive activities.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.960
 Then primarily, how to subdue one's own mind.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:16.080
 Why is God to subdue your own mind? Because all the positive and the negatives are coming from

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:25.280
 fundamentally ignited from mind. You ask yourself, that's true. Every hour action

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:36.640
 ordinarily started from this emptiness mind. No way, we say, come from, but from the emptiness,

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:49.920
 all started. So therefore, subdue your own mind. That is that. That is it. It's like the whole

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:58.960
 practitioners really should remember, we all should remember this teaching. Do not engage

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:06.000
 any negative activities. Or try to not engage any negative activities.

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:17.040
 Perform practicing virtue perfectly or perform the practices. And now, what means negatives,

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:30.160
 of course, your own negatives. Negative is the disturbances. Disturb to our sound. Disturb to the

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:40.960
 others. It will disturb, disturbing to me, it disturbing to you. That is what the negative is.

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:51.120
 Who will disturb first? One's own sound, who activated that, will disturb it and become

00:05:51.920 --> 00:06:04.240
 heavy, burdened, loaded, emotional, uncomfortable, and ducked, eyes cold, completely. That where it

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:14.640
 started is from mind. And mind is what? In the teaching said, and we see subdue is the emptiness.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:23.760
 I mean, it's not just a way of following, Buddha said, and because we like to believe on

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:34.080
 what Buddha said. That is not only case. When you look to our mind, it's mind, there's nothing to

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:45.520
 find of the mind. It's empty. That's really how it started. So, that is how it started with that.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:54.560
 In with the, the tendence of the ego cling. Tendence of the ego. What is the ego?

00:06:54.560 --> 00:07:04.960
 Ego is a mental attitude, mental aspect, self-important, self-centered mind, self-important.

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:16.080
 That is known as the ego, commonly. Nature of the ego is darkness. It's not wisdom. Ego is

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:29.120
 ignorance. And then ego has what? Ego is as, fear, fear. Ego is frightening, frightening.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:38.080
 Because it says it becomes so, so selfish. Therefore, always have the fear, going to lose,

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:48.400
 or going to happen, something. F-E-A-R, fear force. So, it's darkness is fear force. And then also,

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:58.800
 it has aggressive qualities. That is anger. Not actually anger, but it is very forceful things

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:11.760
 to defend it. Defend it. That is what the ego is. So, ego is dark, ego is fearful, ego is very

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:12.160
 tense.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:25.280
 Anger. Anger to defend or to protect. Ego is sad. That is the ego. Prove that ego. We have this ego

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:34.160
 from the biggest times. Same time with the defense of the ego, what is? Is that negative emotions?

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:41.120
 Acting negative emotions, acting tools of the ego arising in the form of anger,

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:48.800
 form of jellous, form of ignorance, form of attachment. That sizzling in our heart and mind

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:55.200
 and begin to reflect that externally through, verbally and physically coming out.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:05.300
 Moment that study in our heart and mind activity, that individually, and we are not happy, we are

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:05.520
 not

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:15.360
 peaceful. That peace and harmony, calmness, quietness is gone. It's become only kind of names that

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:24.880
 complete this effort. Now, our mind is controlled, overpowered by this active, negative emotion

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:25.040
 that

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:31.760
 comes from the ego, ego that comes from the emptiness, our mind. And now, that reflecting to

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:39.840
 how we completely saturated all our channels. Our channels, our energies, all that saturated.

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:47.040
 That created tense to our physical, our body, our everything become tense, tense. And now,

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:54.880
 we project that to the song. So, we already, when we have become tense, we are not comfortable,

00:09:54.880 --> 00:10:01.600
 happy in peace, as I say. Now, when that projected to the others, then it created the same thing.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:07.600
 It created such a big, frightful situation to the others, all uncomfortables,

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:15.920
 frightened fools. And then, then their peace and harmony is also lost.

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:24.800
 So, that's what it's called, negativities. It created everything dark, everything emotions,

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:33.760
 everything uncomfortable, everything unpeaceful, restless. That is what the negative is all started

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:41.840
 from, from the emptiness part. And therefore, then what the greatest master is, tame your mind.

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:50.160
 Being practitioners, we should look immediately, look to the mind, try to tame the mind. Whatever

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:58.240
 method that you're going to use, Hinayana method or the basic Buddha method, or the Mahayana method

00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:58.240
,

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:06.960
 or Vaidhyana method, try to not hovering, circling, homemade that in heart.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:17.680
 That's what's called tame your mind. Taming, that is timing, taming. And we are able to do that.

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:26.560
 We are good, that is good sign of the practicing, your good practitioners of the one following the

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:33.440
 teaching and the greatest master of the Buddha chapter. Teachings, we tame, we let that stop.

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:40.240
 Not that projected, even that hovering in our mind and brain, but let that subside, let that

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:40.640
 liberate

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:50.880
 it. Where that go? It comes from emptiness. It went back to the emptiness. What it does,

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:57.360
 that it does. We need that happen. What it does, according to the teaching, the greatest teachers,

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:04.320
 it cleaved the habit dependence, sewn beneath that momentous. It reduced the habit dependence of

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:04.560
 that

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:14.320
 erupting quality of the emotions, the volcanoes. It really subsided. That's how we cleanse the

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:14.640
 habit

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:28.480
 dependence. That's how we transform the situation into download. That is what, what. So that is

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:36.480
 greediness. So therefore, the root of the negativities, root of negativities, cause of negativities

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:45.840
 is ego and negative emotions. And ego means also what? Also we become kind of over powered by the

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:56.160
 self-important attitudes. Attitudes. All over powered by the egos. Then we brought up those

00:12:56.160 --> 00:13:05.440
 emotions and then created mess to me or one's own self to the others. Then what it created?

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:11.520
 That is the truth. When we started that, that is known, just the beginning of that is known as

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:18.480
 a cold, neglectious teacher, Vadakshatyamuni, post-teaching, cause of suffering truth. Among

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:28.640
 the poor truth that this is cause of suffering truths. When it's projected out, out and it's

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:38.480
 coming, actively coming, that worry is suffering truth. That worry is suffering truth. That not

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:47.280
 ending right there. A cold, neglectious teacher. That then creates the karma. Karma. Karma is like

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:53.680
 ripple efforts. Ripple effort is started from the center of whatever that is, but it's not just a

00:13:53.680 --> 00:14:02.640
 stop there. It continually moving or a stay in the reactions. It created all our environment

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:10.480
 of the consciousness. It is filled with that energies and printed that in the self-consciousness

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:18.720
 slow house. That is known as karma. That not going, even though it subsides a little bit that time,

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:25.920
 it's not going to completely affect the disabled. Karma returns. Karma comes back.

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:33.440
 To who? Coming back to the dual itself, according to various teachers. I mean, you know, you read

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:39.200
 those teachings I read and we heard these teachings from the great masters. So they are

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:46.720
 always thoughtful with our actions. Thoughtful with actions. If we read the smallest ones,

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:53.120
 we should thoughtful. Of course, big ones we thoughtful, but smallest ones. And in the teaching

00:14:53.120 --> 00:15:01.520
 always said, even the smallest we thoughtful don't ignore the small things, even the small sparking

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:09.280
 fire. Small sparking fire can burn the whole valley in the countries. That started with the small

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:19.120
 sparking. Take that example in teaching. So therefore, that is what it is. So this is what

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:28.000
 this is, do not engage in any negative activity. That is where teachings of the according to

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.520
 positive with the teaching. It is suffering, teachings on the suffering true,

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:45.520
 cause of suffering. The next one is practicing virtue perfectly. Practicing virtue perfectly.

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:53.520
 And now, and all practicing positive. So negativity and virtuous.

00:15:53.520 --> 00:16:03.040
 And now, negative virtue comes from where? Again, from the mind. It's not coming from outside.

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:10.800
 It's your mind, my mind, the kind of virtuous. So virtue is something special. We always

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:18.960
 think of virtue as so beautiful, so special. It's true, but it's from your mind, in my mind.

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:29.920
 It's our treasure, our beauty of the name, mind. It is special, it is beautiful,

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:38.640
 but it is our heart, nature of the heart call us, our mind. And virtue is what?

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:47.040
 Virtue is, is from opposite of the ego cleanness. Even though we have the ego now,

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:52.810
 but when we have the virtue, it's completely kind of a little bit opposite or other side of the eg

00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:52.960
os.

00:16:53.920 --> 00:17:01.560
 It's more, but that's what I call, versatile. More intelligence, more origin and nature of the mind

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:01.680
.

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:09.840
 Mind is not the ego. Actually, nature of the mind is not ego. Ego is obscurations.

00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:19.360
 Ego is, is temporarily arises that we develop. Nature of the mind is, a mind,

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:26.800
 reality nature of the mind is calm, peaceful, positive, soothing, calming. That is really the

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:34.800
 mind is. Mind is. So therefore, when we have this, when we say virtues, that means we're

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:41.840
 touching to the, our really the richness of the mind. Readiness of mind, what that virtue is?

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:49.680
 Virtue is we all know, I mean, talking, joy, appreciation, loving kindness, compassion,

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:59.200
 open heart, open mind. And of course, this is known as virtues. There's nothing beside virtues.

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:06.640
 Our meditation, our meditation, our repetition of mantra, all based on this beautiful

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:16.240
 nature. So reciting mantra, visualize the deity, it's joy, appreciation, calm, peace,

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:23.120
 nature calling us that we're bringing out. We're not letting leave that under the pressure of the

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:31.840
 egos and all the negative emotions. We bring out. And when that happens, what is immediate to us in

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:42.400
 our heart and mind, it brings more calm to ourself, calm, peaceful, joy, apogeic, more relaxed,

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:52.160
 more grateful, graceful, more also wisdom. And it's also we develop more common sense,

00:18:53.440 --> 00:19:02.880
 basic, beautiful common sense. We develop them more, more respectful. Not kind of like rocking,

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:10.560
 or rocking, rocking as with emotions or ego. We calm and peaceful, peaceful. And then what does?

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:16.560
 And that is an immediate effect. But in the deep dawn, what is it? In the teaching, it claims we're

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:22.800
 obscurators, hyper-dependence, we're cleansing, we're knocking the door over the ego cleanings,

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:30.240
 the obstacles, is really softening, demolishing its strength and powers of the ego cleanings.

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:37.840
 When we have that, we do it all. So that is, when we do this, then when that happens in our heart

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:37.840
 and

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:45.280
 mind, what that has happened in the mind, again, our whole channels, our energy filled with that

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:54.800
 positive energy, calm, joy, peace, relaxed energy, all of that filled. And then that will begin to

00:19:54.800 --> 00:20:03.520
 reflect to externally. And we need to reflect to the other. Calm, it makes also others comfortable,

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:09.520
 more peaceful, more soothing, more calming, more kind of friendly environments. And when that

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:16.240
 happened, also your, our someone who had our compilations, more bright, more clay, more really

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:22.720
 beautiful, brilliant. And maybe you will see, maybe probably say, oh, you have the auras, auras,

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:30.960
 I can see auras. All those things really happen because the inner qualities. Buddha has a auras,

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:36.480
 Buddha has a life. Why this? This is not just a personally kind of reserved call of the buddhas.

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:44.160
 It is a love. It's a compassion. It's a wisdom. It's a joy. That power is the ex,

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:51.040
 brilliant, the growing external. We see Buddha and all these enlightenings in the heart or in the

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:58.330
 wisdom. Of course, Thakkad, artists like this, but in according, actually, in the Buddha's teaching

00:20:58.330 --> 00:20:58.400
,

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:05.120
 in the teaching, say, all the Buddha is always glorious. Even in the teaching, say, the darkness

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:12.370
 night is the greatest teacher, Buddha Chantia Muni is glowing as the golden mountains with it, with

00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:12.400
 it,

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:17.840
 light, really in the teaching city like that. So many devotees see that in far distance,

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:25.200
 Buddha is meditating under the trees and see that glowing call. This is not just a meditate or kind

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:32.720
 of like hallucinate. It is the call of that true nature, say, arise, arise. That is what it is.

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:39.920
 When we do this, make ourselves calm and peaceful, make happy in the calm, peaceful others that

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:47.440
 happen to the others, that is known as practicing. Practicing which is perfect. That is which you

00:21:47.440 --> 00:22:00.320
 perfect. And how to do that? Again, by mind, tame your mind. Not let that run by the force of the

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:07.680
 negative emotions. When our mind is not let run by the negative emotion, our mind is calm.

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:14.880
 Our mind is peaceful. Our activity is beneficial. Our activity is support and health that to us,

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:20.640
 to all the beings. So this is what really it is. And then, of course, so that is the principle and

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:26.640
 that is the positive. Positive is what? Positive is opposite of those negative emotions,

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:34.240
 what negative emotions? Overtures. Negative emotions, I said, ego clinging, ignorance,

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:42.240
 attachment, anger. So, egolessness. And even though we have the ego, but at least

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:47.840
 not actively involved, kind of actively engaging with that, to subside that status, kind of like

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:55.360
 more subside nature. And with that, more wisdom, more common sense, more loving kindness,

00:22:55.360 --> 00:23:01.120
 more comparisons, not too much grasping, clinging. When we do activity with that,

00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:08.320
 that is known as the positives, which is activities. And then to tame the one,

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:15.360
 completely subjugate your own mind, subjugate your own mind. So those are the ways to subjugate

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:22.480
 mind by saying right. Then subjugate mind is meditations. And meditation, as I said, there's

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:30.640
 three meditations, ekolu vediyana, visualization, repetition of mantra, and vista meditation,

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:36.480
 or vista mind meditations. And meditate, you receive the instruction, we all meditate with

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:43.120
 mindfulness. Such as then, kamada meditation, vivakshana meditation, hodzoki meditation,

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:50.560
 those all will tame, tame the mind and discover it is the origin, beautiful nature of the mind.

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:57.120
 So that is really about this, and that's my really kind of, just a little bit,

00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:04.800
 reminder to our practices, really, and trying to, trying to stay and maintain in this state.

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:10.880
 And as I said, again, I'm so thankful to everyone for coming and making time. I know everyone is

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:17.040
 difficult to, but making this time and coming, thank, okay. And then also, since we're all coming,

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:21.760
 we're trying to make this time, something really, you know, feel like the good things to positive

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:30.240
 this as we're trying to do this as much as we can do with more relaxing and calm, peaceful,

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:36.160
 and this with those motivation, atmosphere, and that is really practicing. And this then becomes,

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:42.160
 it becomes so meaningful. And I just thank you, thank you everyone. And we do again,

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:53.040
 a few minute, one minute meditation, and then we dare to get the short derogator, please.
