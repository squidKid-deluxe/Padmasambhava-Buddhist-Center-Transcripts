00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 Now, again, when Garab Dorje, the master Garab Dorje said, "reflecting the impermanence."

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 That also means respect and reflect law of the cause and condition and result.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 That is everything and what we see. Everything is dependent upon the cause and condition.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.850
 It is doing, developing the result. So that means Dzogchen practice should not ignore, in other

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.000
 words, karma.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 Karma, we should respect and observe karma. Karma is the activity of the one's own self.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 It is going to reflect. And that is not just the only one we do that is called karma,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 but everything what we see in the universal world, in the phenomenal world,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 it is absolutely best on the cause and condition and result.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.200
 This system is known as another in the Buddha's teaching or the terminology, known as inter

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.000
dependent coordination.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 Everything is dependent. There is nothing. It is not dependent.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 Interdependent means also everything is changing. Everything is moving.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 There is nothing one single object existing forever.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 It is changing. It is reflecting. Even our self changes so many times.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 We went through many different stages, one up and up.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 So this law of the karma, the cause and condition,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 we are reflecting that to the impermanence that makes us to go to the ground,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 go to the earth, our self. And it makes our self very practical.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 And also in other words, we will make our self more reasonable, more decent persons

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 and more average person. Therefore, we should respect and reflect the law of the karma

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 or the system of interdependent coordination and at the same time reflect to the impermanence.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 And the impermanence again is the openness in the teaching set.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 When you think of the impermanence, it makes you more reasonable.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 It makes again touch to the natural reality of your self.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 It makes our self more gentle, more peaceful, more calm,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 more appreciated it will bring. It is not just something that we are ignoring,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 look, try to kind of ignore the truth. We are looking to the truth as it is.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 So therefore, this impermanence reflected is so important.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 For that reason, the greatest teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 told first time, his first teaching was for noble truth teaching.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 All the impermanence caused in the kulayat, that was, and that was in the teaching set.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 That is in the lake, the path of place in the dear path.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 Dear path, which is according to the Vedic calendar, which is truly the path of place.
