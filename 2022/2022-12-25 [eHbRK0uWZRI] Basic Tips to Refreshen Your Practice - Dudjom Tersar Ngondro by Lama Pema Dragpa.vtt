00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.640
 Warm greetings. Touch your leg. Warm greetings. Wonderful, such sacred time to have together.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:20.440
 So thanks for coming. Thanks for joining. To really get to have the time to listen to,

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.680
 contemplate, and meditate on the Dharma. It's always really sacred, special time. So trying

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.040
 to reactivate that in my own experience and then offering that opportunity for you to do so as well

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.040
,

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.840
 just as the Venerable Kempa Rinpoche's and all these lineage masters. It reminded us again and

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.720
 again to try to activate these three motivations anytime we're kind of doing anything actually,

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:48.890
 but then specifically in a Dharma context to really try to bring them vividly to mind and kind of

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:49.040
 in

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:56.440
 an openness of heart. And that is renunciation or joy and appreciation and deep gratitude for all

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.840
 the amazing things that we have in our experience right now in our lives. So this renunciation. And

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:09.960
 then secondly, Borichitta, all of us, all beings, every single one, we all want to be free of

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.000
 suffering and we're all going through a lot of challenges. And so really trying to bring kind of

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.960
 a bigger view, a bigger openness of heart, a real tenderness and also a very kind of rooted bravery

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.280
 that, you know, when we're doing this practice together, when we're coming to contemplate the

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.320
 Dharma together, that we're doing this for all beings. May this be the cause for all beings to

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.680
 be happy in every way they can be happy and to be free of suffering and the causes of suffering,

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:46.480
 finally free forever, enlightened. So then thirdly, we take this even more courageous view of this

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:52.960
 kind of Vajra, Vajra view, Vajra pride or the three Vajras or pure perception, trying to really

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:59.200
 tune into the amazing qualities within ourselves and our environment within each other and to

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.560
 really see everything kind of in this more kind of sacred vision and like kind of a pure way, not

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:12.760
 so much funneled through our own kind of tightness or kind of our own in a sense like distorted

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:13.040
 kind

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.880
 of exaggerations, always kind of emphasizing what's not quite right. So instead of doing that,

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:26.560
 trying to really see what's really amazing in a very, very vast way. So this pure perception

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.520
 and as Vajrayana practitioners, we're even in the beginning, we're learning, then we should always

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.080
 try to reactivate these three points that will bring the three Yana teachings and the foundational

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:44.280
 Buddhism, Sutra Mahayana teachings and Vajrayana all together in a single kind of point and that's

00:02:44.280 --> 00:03:03.960
 so just kind of vividly bring these three points to mind right now.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:21.240
 So today is kind of a little bit of like a free flow one. So the general topic is some

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:27.880
 basic tips on refreshing our practice. So basic tips on refreshing our practice.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:36.760
 This is obviously a very big topic and then I'm really going to just kind of say reminders to

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:45.400
 myself in a just a kind of very honest, genuine way. What do I need to do to refresh in my practice

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.400
?

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.080
 And these are just things that kind of came to my mind and they're all based on Dharma teachings

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:55.800
 in no certain order. So it didn't really take the time to kind of lay out points but kind of some

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.520
 points I've thought and like my very limited experience of ways that have helped me kind of

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:07.160
 re-tune a real line with the Dharma, kind of reactivate my bodhicitta, reactivate my renunciation,

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:12.360
 reactivate kind of this sacred awareness. So what's helped me do that and what kind of teachings I

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:17.640
 remember. So just kind of repeating some teachings and then if any of these are helpful, there's

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.800
 like

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:23.160
 a I'm not sure who's watching this, who will see this, what AI will read this and just send this

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:29.960
 somewhere, whoever, whenever, forever, who knows. So if any of the little bits are actually helpful

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.960
,

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.040
 then that's good and the rest, don't worry. And so there's this vast spectrum of practitioners,

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.120
 we all have different worldviews that we're coming from and we all have different things

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.120
 we're really good at, different challenges that we're kind of occupied with or kind of we stumble

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:52.440
 on to. So that said, you know, it's kind of more of like a buffet of certain things to say so

00:04:52.440 --> 00:05:00.040
 in not a specific order, okay. Basic tips on refreshing practice, reminders to myself,

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:06.600
 that's the parenthesis there. So one, I'm just going to go out of the gate, not explain too

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.320
 much because it's more like a list and then we'll see what's helpful, okay. So not some big

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:21.000
 elaboration. Okay, number one, Dharma is not therapy, therapy is therapy. There's so many kinds of

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:29.880
 therapy and in so many ways they're so valuable, but we shouldn't mix these up. So use Dharma for

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:37.960
 Dharma and use therapeutic methods for therapeutic methods. If we mix these up, it can bring a lot

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:43.480
 of kind of different kind of confusion in our practice. It can kind of cause us our practice

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:52.680
 to do kind of all kinds of different things. So point one, there's Dharma and therapy and they're

00:05:52.680 --> 00:06:00.040
 both very valuable, really valuable, sincerely really valuable, but we should distinguish the two

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:06.120
 from each other. Otherwise it can really make the practice kind of get really kind of jumbled.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:13.400
 So that's one, to talk about that for years, but that's just one point. Two,

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:20.200
 almost all Dharma is really, there's a lot of ways to look at it,

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:28.440
 but in one way it's all about being prepared for challenges and big challenge we all face

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:36.280
 as sentient beings is when we're dying and when we die. So it's just coming and we don't know when

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:42.120
 it's coming. So something that different masters have mentioned is have some familiarity with it.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:47.800
 This is actually kind of one of the bedrock essential reasons to practice Dharma is to be

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:54.360
 able to use the opportunity of challenge such as moment of death and with really kind of amazing

00:06:54.360 --> 00:07:02.360
 benefit to be ready for that. And then a technique they say at some point in practice and that's

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:09.000
 according to the guidance of your teacher and your own connections, some degree like a PoA practice

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:09.000
,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:15.960
 being ready like I don't know when I'm gonna die, I'm planning to have Dharma practice for however

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:22.280
 many years, but I'm not really sure. So like one, the aim of Dharma and practice is to really get

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:30.600
 ready for that time when I don't control anything and just dying, can't really control anything.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.680
 And then my tendencies to be scared and freak out are going to definitely come up if I haven't kind

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:40.920
 of worked with them at all. And then these very swift techniques and Vajrayana skillful means

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:45.080
 such as a PoA practice, if you have a connection to that, you have a teacher, you have an interest,

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:50.920
 then that's something to look into at some point in your path. This can also clarify like why we're

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:57.960
 doing Dharma, to kind of bring this more freshly to mind. I am going to die and I don't know when

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:04.440
 and I won't be able to control the circumstances. So like refreshing that awareness, it kind of

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:04.520
 will

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:07.880
 like line up the practice kind of according to certain essential points.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:16.830
 And three, I thought Tonglen, so many times, Tonglen, this giving and taking, sending and receiving

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:16.840
,

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:21.320
 giving others our happiness, taking on their suffering. This is such a profound essential

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:25.960
 practice in Sutra Mariana and Bodhisattva Yana, which means it's like heart of Vajrayana.

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:33.880
 And it's also like works with the breath. So it means it's really grounded in the body.

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:41.800
 And that's something that for so many of us, myself definitely to like really bring in my body

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:47.640
 in a very kind of active conscious way. This practice can like really be a very visceral

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:54.280
 reminder of bodhicitta working with my body in the breath. And kind of it and it's like a very

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:59.080
 simple practice we can do anytime. It doesn't have to be a formal setting. And we can do it

00:08:59.080 --> 00:08:59.560
 silently

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:06.600
 without anyone knowing. So this is like a very special technique we have. And this is like a

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:12.760
 heart technique of bodhisattva path, Tonglen. And there's a lot of technique, a lot of practices,

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:17.800
 instructions on this. But in terms of it, the practice is getting stale. Oh, kind of there's

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:22.120
 a lot of funny things we can kind of start looping into our practice and kind of forget the main

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:27.080
 point. Tonglen really reactivates bodhicitta as the main reason we're doing practice.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:33.400
 May I have the ability to take on the suffering of all beings and give them every happiness,

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:40.840
 all the merit I've made, give it to all the beings. That this is the whole big bedrock point

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:47.160
 of doing dharma from a Vajrayana perspective and Sutra Mahayana perspective, this very bold

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:47.800
 compassion.

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:58.280
 So that's another point. When someone elicits a really strong response in you,

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:03.080
 grabs your attention really strongly, and a poison is so easy to come out,

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:08.520
 then it can be a good refreshing practice to really just connect again to the four boundless.

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:14.680
 That can just be a habit. You know, if we write that, "When I get mad, practice four boundless."

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:20.600
 Then we can do this four boundless prayer. It's just four lines and something we can easily

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:26.770
 memorize. So that can just be kind of like a thing we go to. "Oh, I see myself getting really

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:27.000
 jealous

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.520
 again. Oh, I see myself getting really kind of lustful and desirous again. Oh, I need to really

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:39.240
 reactivate four boundless for myself too." That can be something that all of a sudden we don't get

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:44.200
 so strongly in a groove of again and again expressing our negative emotion, our destructive

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:51.000
 emotion, and overtaking our mindfulness. So this four boundless, like that's so someone comes and

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.200
 they say something mean or something, I'll try to immediately think, "Oh, the four boundless."

00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:01.560
 Even if it's just a rote habit, then it's just a reminder to kind of reactivate the freshness of

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:06.680
 our practice. "Oh, why am I doing this practice?" Infinite happiness, generate infinite happiness,

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:13.320
 infinite compassion, infinite sympathetic joy, infinite equanimity. All beings, even all beings

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:17.960
 being equal, they all have Buddha nature. We all have the same world. We have the same human bodies

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:22.440
 amongst humans. We have the same desire to be happy and avoid suffering, to really refresh in

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:31.480
 these four boundless. It's just so essential. So I say that for myself too. Another point to

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:31.880
 refresh

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:38.680
 in practice, try to regularly talk about Dharma with your friends. It's so nice to have friends.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:44.600
 Try to make a point of it. Go out of your way, schedule some time. If you're not around Dharma

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:50.120
 people, call some people, call some friends, catch up, and specifically talk about certain Dharma

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:55.640
 things. Well, what Dharma books like, how are things going? Are you reading any Dharma lately?

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:59.880
 Have you seen any nice Dharma YouTube videos? Or what have you been thinking about? But

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:00.520
 specifically

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:07.340
 around Dharma. It can really kind of reactivate our initial kind of enthusiasm about the precious

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:07.560
ness

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:12.520
 of Dharma and the specialness of having friends, having people we care about actually to talk about

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:17.880
 Dharma with. And then we see their perspective on it. They re-clarify our perspective. We share

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:22.760
 things kind of, and it makes it a little more personal, kind of starts to like infuse our

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:29.160
 relationships. It can be helpful when our practice gets a little too lonely or a little too kind of

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:35.000
 quiet or self-contained. Just kind of freshen it up. Reach out to some friends, Dharma sisters,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.920
 Dharma brothers, and just talk about the Dharma a little bit. You can have study groups, book

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:39.160
 groups,

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:44.920
 that kind of thing too. But just even every now and then talk about the Dharma, I think is really

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:57.160
 helpful. Another point again, right? These are in no certain order. Guru Yoga. It's the heart of

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:05.240
 Vajrayana practice. It's definitely the heart essence of Zogchen. Guru Yoga. Always have Guru

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:10.360
 Yoga as a practice, especially as a Vajrayana practitioner. It's always going to be a part of

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:15.720
 Nundra. It's always going to be an important part of every single practice we do. Devotion,

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:21.080
 compassion. We have devotion for the beings, the noble ones that are free. We have compassion for

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:26.280
 all the beings and ourselves that aren't free. Devotion and compassion. In Vajrayana context,

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:31.960
 the great Turtanjatasaninkpa said these are the two pillars to boost your Vajrayana practice.

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:39.240
 Devotion to those above and compassion for those equal and below. Devotion for the free enlightened

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:47.560
 ones. Compassion for all of us circling in samsara. And the heart practice of devotion is Guru Yoga

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:47.560
.

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:54.520
 And there's so many Guru Yogas. So just kind of to remember that this is really such an essential

00:13:54.520 --> 00:14:01.840
 practice, specifically for Vajrayana practitioners. And if devotion is not coming so strongly to us

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:01.880
,

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:06.040
 then great masters say, like Zogchen, he says, if you don't have much devotion,

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:09.800
 then pray to Guru Rinpoche to have more devotion.

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:19.240
 And Guru Rinpoche will help. Pray to the Buddha for more devotion. We need to use these duality

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:26.280
 minds to help themselves get out of their duality. This is a Vajrayana method. That's what skillful

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:32.360
 means is all about. Using our relative experiences to have them undo their kind of boundedness,

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:38.280
 to open themselves up. Use duality to undo duality. So we need to pray to these beings

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:42.920
 for their help. Even if they're just in our mind, even if everything's our mind,

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:49.320
 then the display still happens. We need to work with the display. Then definitely prayer is a

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:55.400
 big part of that. Even though Buddhism is non-theistic, doesn't believe in entities at all.

00:14:55.400 --> 00:15:01.480
 There's no thing at all in Buddhism. Not even this moment of watching a video or listening to

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:07.480
 anything. So these profound teachings, even if there's no thing and everything is really

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:14.040
 empty of being stuck and fixed in some frozen way. We still need to pray to the beings, the noble

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:19.960
 ones, the enlightened beings to help us actually recognize this and thoroughly integrate it in our

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:26.840
 experience all the time to really see the fluidity, the flexibility of mind. We need the supports,

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:32.840
 secondary supports to realize the principle point, which is this nature of mind being free of all

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:41.960
 fixation. And a big practice to do that is guru yoga, which is always part of nundra practice.

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:47.320
 He's calling the lama from afar prayers, right? Which we'll do here shortly.

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:54.280
 Like so many times, Venerable Kempo, and Venerable Kenshin, Paul and Cher, said,

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:59.800
 read the life stories of the great masters to inspire your practice. See what obstacles they

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:06.360
 overcame. See the amazing qualities they achieved. Read about the Buddha. Reflect on the qualities

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:12.040
 of what an enlightened being, what's that like? This really kind of a rule, reactivate and

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:19.640
 refreshing our close connection to the Dharma. Why are we doing this? Read life stories. So someone

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:24.600
 who like immediately kind of, oh, something zings in your mind about hearing the person or

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:30.040
 your own teacher, then it's kind of, you know, don't have just every now and then, or just when you

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:30.040
,

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:35.240
 especially when you're really kind of feeling flat or dry or stale in your practice, read the life

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:42.200
 story. And now there's so many avenues of media where we can refresh in connection to teachers

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:46.360
 in the lineage. So it doesn't just have to be a book, but it could be a book too.

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:55.960
 In terms of all that media, we really, I think it's called like, there's different ways to talk

00:16:55.960 --> 00:17:03.480
 about it, but we have to determine how we filter what we kind of take in. So we have to be really

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:10.360
 discerning about that. In terms of practice, it's going to shape us, what we eat, you know,

00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:17.320
 it becomes our bodies. What we, what our mind eats, the experiences we feed it, it shapes our mind.

00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:25.560
 And there's so many things to choose from. And it's getting bigger every day. So regardless,

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:29.480
 we have discern, we're making these choices anyway. So we need to really clearly bring to

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:34.040
 mind what actually helps boost my practice. What can I take in more that's nutritious for my

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:40.120
 practice? What do I know about myself that really shuts off my practice or stunts my practice and

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:45.960
 gets, makes me a lot more confused than that's called discernment. To see that about oneself,

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:52.600
 to have that self knowledge or self awareness. And we can't just expect someone else to always

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:58.920
 filter everything from for us like Google, or just some other person always having to be there to

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:04.040
 remind us what to do a certain be your own master, as the Buddha said, at certain point, we really

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:04.200
 do

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:09.800
 have to take on that responsibility to self filter to really consciously choose like what am I

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:10.200
 taking

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:16.120
 in? What am I available? What am I ready to be able to handle where it won't disrupt make my

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:23.160
 practice it won't make it shaky. Then only we know ourselves best. As the campus owner which

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:27.320
 I said many times, and we need to have the mindfulness to kind of check in with that.

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:33.640
 Otherwise, it's easy for our practice kind of sidetracked with so many distractions.

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:42.040
 I very much know about that. All the distractions. A big point to refreshing practice is really

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:42.520
 always

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:49.240
 returning to the basics. Basic means essential, it means bedrock, it means it's always important to

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:55.320
 include. It's the nuts and bolts of the of our practice of our study of the path. So these four

00:18:55.320 --> 00:19:01.720
 thoughts that turn the mind to the Dharma, or that turn away from samsara, preciousness of human

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:11.640
 embodiment, impermanence, cause and effect, samsara life is really challenging, conditioned mind is

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:16.600
 very challenging. That again and again we should come back to this, contemplate this, read about

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:21.880
 this like words of my perfect teacher or Shantideva's way of the bodhisattva or to spend time at

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:21.960
 the

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:27.640
 beginning of our nundra practice, the common nundra, really spend extra time. We can zoom in on one

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:27.720
 of

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:32.680
 the four thoughts or just repeat all four of them more and more and more and repeat them and then

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:38.440
 pause and let our minds kind of be with it. It's really important this is really part of the

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:44.680
 renunciation, foundation of our practice or cultivating joy and appreciation.

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:53.160
 So we should really come back to these basics, basics meaning always important, every single

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:58.040
 moment, every single session. They'll really reinvigorate our practice, doesn't use a lot

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:02.840
 of complicated logic, we don't need it's very common sensical, we don't have to take anyone's

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:08.360
 word for it, it's impermanence for example, to really highlight that again.

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:16.040
 It'll really reinvigorate the point, our direction of practice, the point of our practice.

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:22.360
 Part of that is just again and again if we can recite refuge in bodhicitta prayers.

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:28.440
 Again refuge prayers four lines, bodhicitta prayer, they can be very extensive or very

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:32.440
 simple. It's really good to memorize some of these simple practices because so many times in our

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:38.200
 lives are these in-between times where we're moving from one thing to another, a place to another,

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:44.280
 a project to another, moving between meals, in a car. These we have so many in-between times,

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:49.880
 these transitional times. Then if we have a certain memorized prayers we can do these prayers

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:54.280
 and connect to the dharma and why is memorizing a prayer good? Because these are the words of noble

00:20:54.280 --> 00:21:01.160
 ones. They weren't just invented recently. Even to repeat their words we're connecting with the

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:07.080
 vision they had, the realization they had, the power they had, the goodness, the skillful means.

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:12.520
 Now that pattern is in our mind. We have their words in our mind. It's in our alaya and we

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:18.520
 connect to that and just go for refuge again. Say the bodhicitta prayer again, say four boundless

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:24.440
 prayer again. You could be in the car waiting. If you memorize your nundra practice, just recite

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:30.340
 the nundra practice again or go to a certain part of the nundra practice. If we memorize these

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:30.600
 short

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:35.240
 prayers it can really be a big enhancement for our practice with all these in-between

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:41.480
 times we have in life. That often time we just don't pick up a phone and fill the time that way.

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:48.460
 We could just pause and you know there's so many so many things we could do that are really wholes

00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:48.600
ome

00:21:48.600 --> 00:22:00.040
 with that time. Three things we always have in terms of like trying to think of things. How can

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:06.680
 we bring all the practice into a single simple set? The master Patra Karmiche said some time ago,

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:15.180
 always kind of bring together the gut, the heart and the head. The head is this wisdom,

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:15.800
 intelligence.

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:23.960
 The heart is compassion and bodhicitta. The gut is one's integrity or this even vadriyana context

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:31.400
 vadra pride. The essential goodness that one has to reconnect to that goodness and with kindness

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:37.560
 and genuine concern for others activate that heartfelt bodhicitta. Then with discernment

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:44.830
 and clarity and a flexibility and openness of mind to like brighten the wisdom of not necessarily

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:44.920
 the

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:52.500
 head but is just an easy way to kind of remember. Head, heart, gut, wisdom, compassion, and dignity

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:52.520
.

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:56.680
 A certain sense of internal strength, a resolve.

00:22:56.680 --> 00:23:04.440
 It's like a simple way to kind of, oh if I reframe my practice, oh it's something's not working,

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:10.760
 oh am I including my head and my heart and my gut? Okay a head, heart, gut, okay I'm doing that.

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:16.920
 All right now practice. It's kind of some simple reframing can sometimes really help.

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:23.160
 I find it good if you there's certain points in a teaching or certain instructions you've

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:28.680
 received from your teacher over the years or recently to write them down somehow. Write it

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:36.200
 down and come back to those. Pull out that paper and read it again later. Week later, month later,

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:41.080
 year later, five years later there's a connection you have to that teaching you receive directly

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:48.360
 from your teacher. Pull out that paper, really reflect on that instruction again. This can be

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:53.640
 incredibly impactful that we have this personal instruction we've received from a teacher.

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:59.640
 And then secondly another way to receive which kind of related like to receive the teachings well

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:07.320
 is to take every teaching that you're at as a personal instruction. It's not an instruction

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:13.880
 for the neighbor. It's something immediately you want to take it into your mind stream as if this

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:20.920
 is advice for me and even if it's not immediately relevant to me the future is a very vast big

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:29.870
 project and at some point it's going to be relevant and helpful for me on my path. So to receive

00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:30.120
 the

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:37.000
 teaching as like a personal advice doesn't mean we have to do it all at once but to be open to have

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.600
 an openness of mind where we're not immediately we take a teaching and we're like kind of

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:45.880
 letting it stream and oh this teaching's for that person and this teaching's for that person and I

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:50.760
 know this other person has that problem and this instead of doing that we're take it to me

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:57.560
 and like have it like really sink in my heart so that it can open up my own ego grasping

00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:04.760
 and if not now then for the future time. And also it becomes a set of skillful means on a

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:11.000
 bodhisattva path that we're learning things so in the future this becomes another way that we can

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:17.080
 like kind of very intelligently communicate and be with others if we're kind of in that

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:21.480
 moment of receiving a teaching to kind of receive it with that kind of openness and willingness to

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:28.680
 absorb it to let that shock the kind of shock of that goodness like sink in us instead of

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:29.160
 immediately

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:33.480
 kind of like water off a duck's back just kind of redirecting it somewhere else.

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:43.960
 Like a mundane thing I found with practice I have like many pages of this but I'm not going to get

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:49.880
 to all of it but a main thing a mundane thing I found is you know check in with the news what's

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:57.480
 going on in the world but don't do it every all the time because this can actually I mean

00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:01.960
 there's a lot of reasons around this but in terms of for practice it can be very disruptive.

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:08.040
 We need to know what's going on we care about the world we care about beings we want to know

00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:15.560
 what's happening but at a certain point it's just kind of like gossip because if we can't really do

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:20.200
 much about it and it just kind of putting us in a really agitated state of mind where we're always

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:26.440
 upset or we have this kind of standard for ourselves so we're always have to know about

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:32.680
 everything because otherwise I'm not really proficient enough I'm not good enough I'm like

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:36.720
 kind of shirking my duty as a responsible citizen to not know about every single thing that

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:37.000
 happened

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:43.480
 in the world today that's a really unrealistic goal we can't know that we've never known that

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:47.960
 as human beings a Buddha is ready to know that information that's why they're omniscient

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:54.600
 because their bodhicitta is limitless but I'm personally not ready but to know a little bit

00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:59.800
 know what's going on really immediately because that's where mainly I can like actually help

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:06.040
 beings I as a limited being have more kind of availability to like show up for what's immediately

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:12.520
 around around me because it's just right happening in front of me but then the larger framing of

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:12.680
 the

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:20.360
 world and other things it's just touch in but don't don't make it so that that's like your

00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:26.360
 job to know about the news and not really ever do much about it just be upset because that it'll

00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:31.720
 really kind of undermine our our gut and our head and our heart it can really cause us to be in a

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:37.160
 very pretty destructive state of mind way too much of the time where we become broken-hearted

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:44.360
 practitioners instead of soft-hearted practitioners we need that tenderness of heart but we need

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:44.760
 that

00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:50.680
 bravery of gut and we need that open flexible illusory kind of like engagement with life

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:56.600
 the wisdom otherwise it's just heartbreaking to listen to all the bad news

00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:05.150
 and it doesn't kind of like it won't be a long-lasting strategy on the buddhist path too much too

00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:05.480
 soon

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:14.280
 another thing with that all these updates we always get I found it really helpful to like

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:19.320
 I don't have a smartphone but I have an ipod to like turn off most of the notifications

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:25.560
 it's all mundane stuff but constantly your mind has to go to something else

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:30.680
 you constantly break frame of your what you're working with the practice you're doing you're

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:34.120
 practicing you're trying to do some mantras for example you're trying to sit there quietly and

00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:42.040
 every few minutes is bing bing whoosh bing bing bing no I mean who can handle that

00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:49.240
 it's so disruptive at least silence the phone but if you just turn off some notifications it makes

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:54.040
 it I mean just your phone's there you can look at all the things but it's not controlling you so

00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:58.600
 much I really found that really helpful when I turned off a lot of these notifications on my ipod

00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:03.720
 this is not a dharma thing this is just a regular everyday thing some more regular everyday things

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:07.240
 is our body and our minds really like regularity

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:12.440
 they it just really it's just a fact and like natural systems like rhythms

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:18.120
 they don't like it when it's always disrupted now it's 40 degrees now it's negative five

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:24.760
 the what the natural systems can't handle these jumps so well and our minds are similar and so

00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:31.560
 are our bodies so regular rhythms say that for myself regular eating regular sleeping

00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:37.160
 regular exercising all these mundane things that are like caring for our body our vessel

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:43.720
 there's stuff that like I know the shoulds that I know I should do eat more greens eat more whole

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:48.900
 foods eat less processed foods these simple things you don't have to be a really sophisticated

00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:49.320
 doctor

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:55.240
 they're simple basic things people have known for a long time but then the question is doing them

00:29:55.240 --> 00:30:00.520
 I know camperomache once was really strong in the 2011 his mountain retreat instructions he was

00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:05.480
 giving commentary on those of his homeless dude rumba che and he said that really clearly we know

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:12.200
 for the most part what we should do our buddha nature knows our intelligence knows this is a

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:16.120
 question of like aligning that intention our motivation our knowledge with our action

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:23.960
 so to have the gap between the intention and the action lesson so what we know is the good

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:28.680
 healthy bodhisattva move for ourselves and others then we kind of do that and regularity can really

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:34.920
 help avoid some of the disruption and distraction that comes with just kind of being out of sync

00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:39.560
 it's just difficult to manage that kind of juggling when it's irregular

00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:45.000
 um one thing is try to keep open mind

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:54.120
 with stuff we don't understand yet and buddhism is filled with that as for sentient beings all the

00:30:54.120 --> 00:31:01.160
 teachings on the six realms pass in future lives and like super powers and metacognitive abilities

00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:08.680
 and all this subtle level causation just keep an open mind maybe at least maybe like maybe

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:17.640
 maybe mind or at or a what if mind well what if that is possible at least pause leave some space

00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:23.160
 in the room where we haven't let made a firm decision on as if we know we're like capable to

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:30.840
 no for sure 100 something is true or false with some of these subtler level causation things

00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:38.520
 if we keep a little space maybe or maybe it allows room for us to grow

00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:43.560
 it's like even being a scientist being an open-minded scientist

00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:50.040
 it's really important to have the open-minded part otherwise we really limit what we can learn

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:57.000
 new things we can learn things unknowns that we didn't know about patterns that we didn't see yet

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.120
 so like kind of have this fresh open mind like hold it lightly

00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:07.400
 and if it's if it's inspiring for us to think of past and future lives which it is for me

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:13.240
 definitely very much so then let that inspiration be fuel for your practice

00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:18.680
 it's the openness that's kind of this main point here

00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:27.480
 the open mind not not soggy mind and wish-washy mind but open maybe and then if you really get

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:35.000
 interested in something look closely research discern test it taste it check it out if it's

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.520
 really something that's very activating for you like how you have a connection with it

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:50.360
 this is a long list and i'm just jumping around a lot but i found some of these things really

00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:56.520
 helpful for me i think one of them is realistically we have to go deeper somewhere we can't go deep

00:32:56.520 --> 00:33:01.480
 everywhere that means at a certain point we really do have to choose what we want to really

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:09.320
 hone or care for or really deepen whether it's a certain practice a certain kind of field of study

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:15.400
 anything any educations like that we can't learn everything at once we have to like specifically

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:20.920
 go deep in certain spots and so in terms of buddha dharma then like having those bedrock

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:27.720
 essentials be clear if we go deep in those it'll give us a good foundation for all these other

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:33.080
 things we could explore because it'll keep things lined up with the dharma with the teachings of

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:33.240
 the

00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:39.160
 buddha but at a certain point we really do have to decide to go deep somewhere we just can't get

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:45.240
 around it if we try this practice that practice and we keep moving around like the ribbon shades

00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:51.320
 it said so many times it's like transplanting a plant too much it doesn't take a root really

00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:57.880
 strongly anywhere and eventually it makes the plant very very weak so we just kind of have that

00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:03.240
 reality life is short and we have to choose to go deep somewhere at some point so you kind of

00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:08.280
 really investigate for yourself and then go deep and then check in with other people with your

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:13.720
 teachers your expert other experts and see if it's working out for you wherever you chose to

00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:15.720
 go deep like you know check in again

00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:26.760
 in buddhism it's such a long path there's so many things to study there's so many practices

00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:33.880
 so learning some of these essential frameworks is really helpful to have the practice keep on track

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:41.160
 like the four noble trues four seals three turnings of wheel of dharma four boundless

00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:46.280
 quality it's four boundless qualities it's not as if everything with a numbered system

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:51.800
 is a what's called a metaheuristic or this a framing that like holds all of reality and like

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:57.160
 very easy things to remember without kind of leaving anything out buddhism's filled with these

00:34:57.160 --> 00:35:02.680
 techniques but we should really learn some of these basic frameworks it'll help us from getting

00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:09.720
 too lost because the mind is a vast place to explore and the world is a very big playground

00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:16.600
 so having some essential frameworks like four noble trues and spending some time with four

00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:23.560
 noble trues the four these are essential dharma teachings can really help our practice stay on

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:28.360
 track and when we get in deep somewhere and we kind of lose our footing we can always pull back

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:33.320
 to these essential frameworks and they'll recorrect or realign our practice and our

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:37.560
 motivation really stably in a reliable way according to the buddha dharma

00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:45.320
 there's simple things like that can refresh in practice like having a prayer wheel like just

00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:50.520
 spin the prayer wheel sometimes or like simple practices like say the mani mantra of chenrezig

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:57.240
 if you have that transmission like as well as do as only as do go cancer is it hard of compassion

00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:03.970
 or heart treasure heart treasure of the enlightened ones is this whole big book is just on how

00:36:03.970 --> 00:36:04.360
 special

00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:10.520
 the mani mantra is in all these ways he unpacks it this nunye practice reciting the mani mantra

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:17.240
 i mean it's so powerful but it's so simple too let's have a prayer wheel say oh mani peh meh

00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:23.960
 oh mani peh do that some it'll kind of can help kind of get merit fast because this is all it is

00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:29.240
 a lot about getting merit we need a boost of the merit of good positive qualities our own buddha

00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:36.200
 nature qualities we need to awaken them enlighten them boost them clarify them spin a prayer wheel

00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:40.520
 if you have a teacher have the teacher blessed a prayer wheel all of a sudden you're spinning a

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:46.760
 breast blessed prayer wheel see ding and then all these mantras are going out it's so simple

00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:52.920
 say the mani mantra this sometimes just keeping it simple is so much is so much more reliable

00:36:52.920 --> 00:37:01.800
 it can really help to zoom out and be simple and at the same time fadriana is filled with skillful

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:09.240
 means all these techniques like soak ceremonies and llama dances and san mandalas and making light

00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:14.440
 offerings and hanging prayer flags and making real essential smoke offerings there's such an array

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:21.880
 of ways that we can these secondary qualities techniques we can use to boost our practice to

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:27.480
 boost our intelligence and our awareness our heartfulness our bora chitta there's so many extra

00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:27.640
 like

00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:32.590
 extra practices we can do so if you have one that you really connect with and you feel your

00:37:32.590 --> 00:37:33.000
 practice

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:39.560
 getting flat a little bit then go to these extra practices too and boost them and ask for help for

00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:43.560
 your teacher ask them is there any other things any things i can do that will support me to kind

00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:49.160
 of get back on track or kind of brighten my practice there's so many skillful means in

00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:54.840
 the vajriana path of skillful means and liberation so we should like we don't have to do all of

00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:55.240
 them

00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:59.160
 but every now and then it's really good to do some especially on these certain days

00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:05.560
 10th day 25th day but in between time too liberation upon seeing it's so easy put some

00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:12.760
 liberation upon seeing every now here and there like the the meritorious impact of these techniques

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:16.120
 these skillful means is so deep according to what the buddha taught

00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:26.040
 a simple thing with practice is we should i should don't mistake what's good for me

00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:34.520
 being good for everybody because dharma is context sensitive it depends interdependence

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:39.320
 what's good for me is good for me right now but what's good for someone else could be good for

00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:43.800
 them so just rejoice in what what's working for someone else even a non-buddhist thing

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:49.720
 be so happy if someone's happy they have something working for them celebrate that oh you're just

00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:49.880
 so

00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:55.240
 happy rejoice don't make the mistake that fundamentalists move where oh this is the

00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:59.720
 best thing this is so good for me now everyone needs to try it too because it's a one-size-fits-all

00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:07.320
 approach the buddha was really strongly against this kind of thing because of interdependence

00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:14.280
 one thing isn't it's nothing is permanent like that it's where it's the same in all cases

00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:21.080
 depends on the situation on the context so i should look to my mind what's working for

00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:25.800
 my mind now and it's not necessarily what is everyone else needs to do too i shouldn't have

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:30.280
 that kind of timidity of my own mind where i need everyone else to agree with me in order to be

00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:30.520
 okay

00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:35.160
 with my decision i should have this kind of confidence in my own decision without having

00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:43.080
 to have everyone just say yes drop but you're right because this i mean not gonna happen

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:53.000
 see right all right i'm not going on i mean right now i've like cut two more minutes

00:39:53.000 --> 00:40:04.600
 okay some sara chores are endless it's endless endless so we shouldn't sacrifice our practice

00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:11.240
 for our chores we don't need to have a balance there's be responsible citizen responsible wife

00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:17.480
 husband friend partner uh co-worker all these things we need to show up with responsibility

00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:23.960
 in our commitments for sure but these the ways to show up in samsaric world is constantly changing

00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:31.720
 in so many details it's endless so at a certain point we really do have to say oh i can't keep

00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:37.320
 sacrificing kind of the principle thing like doing dharma things for all these things there's

00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:43.080
 always more dishes to do there's always some other project we can like rumba say right when

00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:48.280
 you sit down to do your practice if at that time you think oh my dharma books are a little messy

00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:53.080
 over there i should stop my practice and go straighten up my books that's an obstacle

00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:59.800
 that's not a dharma activity so we should see that for ourselves just not don't be swept away

00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:07.240
 in endless chores because they really are endless and then no one what they say no one dies and no

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:11.960
 one when when people die no one dies having accomplished everything they wanted to there's

00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:17.400
 always things left on the list but when we die the only thing that really helps is the dharma

00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:21.800
 how much goodness did did i get familiar with in my life

00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:31.320
 how kind did my mind come become how open did my heart get how flexible is my mind

00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:38.520
 how resilient is my awareness how really like kind of how loving is my approach to experience

00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:45.000
 how much am i still fighting against reality instead how much am i embracing it well this

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:50.440
 experience is happening now that's what will actually help us in the time of death and then

00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:56.280
 that's what will actually continue after we die anyway we don't get to keep all these things

00:41:56.280 --> 00:42:01.720
 and our status and names and like you know i mean it's like a few weeks after we die we don't even

00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:08.200
 remember our own name let alone the names of the people we were around that's what the barto

00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:19.080
 teaching say we can't yeah i can't even remember my own name but my mind is still there and the

00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:23.720
 the winds the karmic winds and the wisdom winds that came with that mind they were influenced by

00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:30.200
 the merit i did and the wisdom that i opened they're still with me so those are kind of keeping the

00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:37.000
 main part of meaning like principle of the practice like in the front and ask for help

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:44.520
 pray to the buddhas ask your teacher ask good friends that you trust you know have trustworthy

00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:52.120
 friends that you care about and they care about you be a trustworthy friend that really when we

00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:56.360
 get stuck or flat or just gets kind of you know life kind of we get into these habit patterns you

00:42:56.360 --> 00:43:00.840
 know we're just we kind of start not paying attention so much to what's around us that's

00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:06.200
 awesome and we always look grass is always greener you know but like just check in with

00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:12.600
 friends with our loved ones with our teachers with our guides to help clarify that they can

00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:16.120
 give us some more perspective what we might be overlooking or taking for granted

00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:23.160
 because so much of it is in our favor already we have so many good things that are already in our

00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:29.640
 favor this human body this mind these good friends this special opportunity with the dharma living

00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:37.080
 lineage living lineage masters it's all right here for us already we get to stop here and

00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:41.960
 listening to me go on and on and now we get to practice the dharma it's such a sacred special

00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:48.600
 thing and then at the end of all these all the practices we do any good little things always

00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:56.770
 dedicate the merit even if it's just this four-line tsunami but this merit may all obtain omnis

00:43:56.770 --> 00:43:57.080
cience

00:43:57.080 --> 00:44:05.240
 we just seal every good deed just take literally four seconds to just seal the deed with that

00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:11.560
 genuine heartfelt dedication and take that drop of goodness and put it in a vast ocean of goodness

00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:16.680
 that all these beings sentient beings and enlightened beings all this goodness we dedicate

00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:20.600
 that for the happiness and enlightenment of all beings and then seal it it'll really boost our

00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:27.160
 path now and long into the future on the kind of our bodhisattva path so those are a few kind of

00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:33.240
 random things that are coming to mind there's like four more pages of them but the time is short

00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:40.200
 so we're just kind of get jumped to the point um and i really if i'm saying too much there was

00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:45.000
 just something needed there's a lot of a lot of points could say a lot about them and i'm just

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.640
 kind of zooming in and throwing things out i know it's like a special kind of like family friends

00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:56.680
 time and we just ate such good yummy food here so my mind's a little like so a little soggier

00:44:56.680 --> 00:45:01.800
 as on the soggy side plus a little little coffee so it's on the caffeinated soggy side so it's a

00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:08.040
 little kind of odd but really i hope this was help if i said stuff wrong oh yeah floss

00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:17.640
 don't forget the flaws in sunscreen i'm going to go with kurt vonnegut sunscreen use sunscreen

00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:22.840
 not really there's a really all these mundane things help our practice too because they prevent

00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:27.880
 these common worldly obstacles that end up if we don't deal with them go to the doctor regularly

00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:33.400
 we don't do that small things can become big things later like they said with these things

00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:38.680
 small negativities we really try to eliminate them and purify them quickly small positive things

00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:44.040
 just do that right away if you see you can do a good thing just do it don't second guess it just

00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:49.960
 do it because on them in the mundane level too these small little things if we try to care for

00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:54.440
 them as they come up then they don't avalanche into these big things later creating a lot of

00:45:54.440 --> 00:46:00.200
 obstacles that were fairly preventable life is precious and really thank you friends thank you

00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:06.840
 darman family thank you thank you all love you thank you all i'm gonna do some do some

00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:19.240
 do some tears are under practice thank you friends

00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:33.400
 a few little wrap-up things so

00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:39.800
 in terms of the topic of like boosting our practice refreshing our practice

00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:46.440
 our practice has to be honoring the human parts of ourselves and also the like deep buddha nature

00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:52.520
 parts of ourselves and then the same with others the humanness of others and the buddha nature of

00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:59.080
 others so we're constantly have these two sides we're trying to honor and care for so to refresh

00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:05.320
 in our practice we can like we have to boost both sides me as a me a specific human being

00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:11.880
 what helps me relax and kind of like open up and brighten and soften and be courageous and

00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:18.840
 playful and helpful and caring so that's all the me human stuff and then if we go deeper it goes

00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:23.000
 into buddha nature those are all natural kind of threads into the buddha dharma the buddha nature

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:29.800
 in ourselves and so then these deeper qualities that aren't so much about me the unique me and my

00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:36.200
 unique habits but more the like unchanging nature of my mind and that kind of the deep kind of

00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:41.880
 richness of myself so like these in terms of boosting practice like anything that kind of

00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:47.960
 hooks in and locks us into a certain kind of humanness of me or a certain idea i have of my

00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:52.920
 buddha nature like our practice is trying to loosen that and freshen that kind of like have

00:47:52.920 --> 00:48:00.360
 that flow both sides better so just as a general kind of idea in the end but those places we get

00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:05.160
 stuck like say we're keep thinking about something that happened to us someone wronged us we have

00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:12.360
 this ongoing grudge then part of our something to loosen that because it really can stifle our

00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:18.920
 practice loosen that like dedicate some merit of your practice to that specific person or that

00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:24.280
 situation that resolve made that person have happiness in the causes of happiness and really

00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:28.920
 try to change that our connection to them our connection to our memory of what happened

00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:34.040
 like forgive that but i also do that with a practice where we dedicate the merit specifically

00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:39.720
 to help lighten that and resolve that and open that so it doesn't keep dragging us down

00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:46.520
 and i thought specifically for all the young men out there i wanted to say this because i'm a guy

00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:52.120
 a dude right and then i'm not that young anymore but youngish but in terms of freshening your

00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:56.760
 practice and i speak in generalizations and stereotypes and stuff please do make your bed

00:48:56.760 --> 00:49:02.920
 clean your room you know wash up and all the good things like being a person

00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:09.240
 good person who shows up like because that's just like caring about the situation you're in

00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:13.720
 and if you're a young guy and you think you're a toku you're probably not

00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:18.760
 it's probably the indication you're definitely not a toku if you think you're some special thing

00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:24.760
 so that can really get you mess up your practice if you think i'm so special i'm so special look

00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:30.840
 at me i'm doing this part of that usually comes with a lot of like first strong kind of very

00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:37.960
 militant enthusiasm like i'm going to practice so hardcore and it always pops i've seen it pop so

00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:46.040
 many times it's much more slow and steady pace and i think that's like that'll really soften the

00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:49.880
 practice because in the end we're trying to reframe the practice just isn't about me and it's not

00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:50.120
 just

00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:55.960
 about this life and it's not just about the stuff i can see really tried a long term really open

00:49:55.960 --> 00:50:02.280
 vision this is much more about future lives in terms of the buddhist conception what's this life

00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:06.440
 is just the result we're mainly experiencing the result of what happened a long time ago

00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:11.960
 we can't really change much of that we can just change how we respond to that and to plant seeds

00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:17.320
 for what comes next in the future so if we have a little bigger view of our practice more beings

00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:23.320
 not just me but more beings not just this life but more lives at least like open to the possibility

00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:29.080
 of that it'll kind of like help our practice soften and be a little more paced a little more

00:50:29.080 --> 00:50:35.080
 kind of like in touch with reality in a way and natural we should kind of get out of nature some

00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:42.040
 and like have playful time too not so serious not so trying to save all the world and do all this

00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:47.800
 i mean it's we want to have this urgent really deep concern for beings but at the same time like we

00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:54.040
 really didn't start this story i mean it really stuck in my mind we didn't start this this samsara

00:50:54.040 --> 00:51:00.200
 thing now this version our experience now this is a long time ago and like whatever we do with

00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:04.240
 our practice and the whole like freeing all beings of samsara it's not going to end in the next

00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:04.520
 year

00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:10.120
 this is a long-term vision we need to like actually give ourselves a little bit of a break

00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:17.320
 a little bit more open view like we're not going to just fix something this is like a bigger view

00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:23.000
 and like with that way like our practice i think becomes much more realistic more about natural

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:28.360
 rhythms there's ups and downs and easy times and hard times and joyful times and sad times and

00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:33.640
 this is just kind of how life flows so amidst all that flowing let that flow happen that's about

00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:39.240
 being human but then in terms of what goes up and what goes down what is born and what dies

00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:45.800
 part of the practice really is recognizing what is undying what doesn't change

00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:52.120
 and that's like a really core aspect of the practice and the more this absolute buddha

00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:56.840
 nature aspect of the practice that we really shouldn't forget amidst all the changing

00:51:56.840 --> 00:52:03.320
 appearances that we experience and then try to we shouldn't forget that the absolute guru

00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:11.000
 the absolute bodhicitta too so a few little things thank you all really thank you it's

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:22.440
 precious time thank you appreciate it thank you

00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:27.340
 you
