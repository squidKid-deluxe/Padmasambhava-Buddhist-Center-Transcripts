00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.780
 "In this realm, inseparable within our own teacher Murpema Samba was regulated. In front of that, I

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.720
 am acknowledging that I have had these mistakes, mistakes."

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:24.350
 "Then what restores that? And when you acknowledge that with strongly, and then to restore that

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:33.650
 with the convergence or commitment that I am not going to repeat such activities again, again, by

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:39.790
 the blessings of the Buddha and all the Buddha's bodhisattva, by the blessings of Murpema Samba and

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.880
 Vaidya Sattva, may I never repeat that again."

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:52.480
 "With that wish and prayer and have strongly attitude that I am not going to repeat that again."

00:00:52.480 --> 00:01:20.200
 "With that attitude, the fourth power, then a fire, may Vaidya Sattva practice it as one can stop

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.200
 it. According to the teaching, we are clearly activating those Vibhavadi for powers, and practicing

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.200
 the Vaidya Sattva for power, applying the Antedos of the man. Then it will put a fire, it will

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.360
 clear it."

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:28.220
 "Unless that karma is so close, right, with us than that, but otherwise if that karma is led apart,

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:36.170
 less than from us, and going to happen, we will reverse, we are good, true, and cleansing, and

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.400
 purified. And that is really about the Vaidya Sattva practices."

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.670
 "The next one is then Guru Yoga practices, which is number three, I think. Guru Yoga practices is

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:54.920
 so important in the teaching field, particularly the Vaidya and the teaching field. Generally, Guru

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:01.280
 is important all the time. Even you are not practitioners, even you are non-believers. Guru means,

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:08.430
 in one way, is a teacher. Teacher is important. Even you do not believe well or even you don't have

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.280
 any belief, but if you like to get a duty, you can do it."

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:18.200
 "BHG, or the MD, you have to contact the teacher. You are not going to get a duty and learn

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:27.380
 everything. You have to contact the teacher. That is common knowledge in India. This is what is

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.280
 really important. Teachers are important."

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:39.230
 "We are not going to contact the teacher because they are payables. We are going to contact the

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.280
 teacher because of our payables. That is what is standing."

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:50.800
 "Then in the Vaidya and the teaching, I am beginning to go to the teaching everywhere. Teachers are

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:59.280
 able to say the way. Teacher, one is showing the directions. Teacher is guiding us, guiding us,

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:06.710
 helping support to activate what we deserve or what we desire, what we are thinking to get. That is

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.280
 what really teaches."

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.750
 "So therefore, teachers are always important. And then particularly in the Vaidya and the teaching,

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:21.220
 it is always important. Without the teacher, there is no history that individuals get the Buddhah

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.280
ood of enlightenment.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:33.340
 And based in Buddhism, they are teaching, known as "shyaraka-yanas", or "bharthi-buddhas", solitude

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:41.280
 in light beings. So they get enlightenment without the teacher. See, except that.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:47.100
 But even that solitude in light beings, according to the teaching, I mean not the oldest, according

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:53.280
 to the teaching, in the teaching say, that solitude practice, you know, that who is practicing,

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:59.730
 they contact the teacher, they practice and meditate, they just for a long time, long time, all the

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:00.280
 time.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:08.910
 Last time, before they get enlightened or become a part of the Buddha, then they choose to be

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:17.340
 solitude. And then nature was always solitude, nature. And therefore, they choose, they like to be

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:24.630
 enlightened, when there is no teaching, there is no teaching, no teacher, and during that time, I

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.280
 like to get enlightened.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:32.230
 That's the one of the DTS. But otherwise, all to get Buddhahood, enlightened, perfect, true,

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:37.280
 enlightened, there is no history that you get enlightened without the teacher.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:43.670
 And then the teacher, we are talking about his study. There is a qualified teacher, and then there

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.280
 is also some crowd, they examine him as good.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:56.360
 There is so many stories I said to you, and you all know that. But once you counter, we have to

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.280
 practice. We have to close the contact.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:07.680
 That teacher is known as the teacher, which is great kindness. Even something in the teaching says

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:15.170
 that the realization level, that teacher is equal with all the Buddhas, but personally kindness

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:20.280
 level is more kindness than the Buddha, more kindness than the Buddha.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:28.280
 Don't say it. You know, this s훮rya kunde nyam n훮yen, god is s훮rya kunde tath훮 kul jus.

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:36.130
 We call it, the realization level, you are equal with all the Buddhas, but kindness level is more

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:41.280
 kindness, that teacher is more kindness than the Buddha.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:48.490
 What the kindness did, they called it vedira teaching. The first level, when you enter to dharma,

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:56.280
 dharma, guided of the what is negative, what is bad for us, us taught that.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:02.480
 So that means, it struck the door of the Lorentz, a birth to the Lorentz, and the samsara. It

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.280
 struck, helped to stop that.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:14.040
 At the same time, that teacher taught what is good for us to learn, practice, meditate, and do

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.280
 virtues. What is that?

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:24.280
 Show that heart, so that means, that teacher is open the door of the higher realm in the Lorentz.

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:30.280
 So shut down the door of the samsara, open the door of the Lorentz.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:37.280
 Then that teacher also helped and gave the teachings on the bodhic.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:41.280
 And bodhic are the words, teachings on bodhic.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:50.020
 So that means, that nurtures our Buddha nature, so that we can bloom or grow beautiful our Buddha

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:51.280
 nature.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:07:00.360
 Then what next? According to vedira, according to zogki, zogki teacher, that teacher pointed out

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.280
 our inner nature of the dharma kaya.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:13.280
 So that means, that teacher helped to recapture our inherited, our inherited traditions.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:21.280
 Therefore, that teacher is very kindness, kinder than the Buddha.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.280
 That was the teaching said.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:33.280
 And then vedira teacher also said, teacher is very kind, because teacher gave us involvement,

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:37.280
 explanation, and big instructions.

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:45.910
 Those all, what I listed, every second to get enlightenment, every last giant enlightenment through

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:52.280
 the Buddha teaching, those are so precious, so important.

00:07:52.280 --> 00:08:08.430
 More precious than the teaching said, than the wishful dual. Wishful dual is in the Buddha's

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:08.960
 teaching said, one who granted all the material wishes, wishes, there is dual that granted all the

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:13.060
 material wishes of wealth, wealth granted, there is such existing in the Buddha teaching mentioned

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:14.280
 so many times.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:25.750
 But that, these instructions, these teachings is more precious, more, more special than that we

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:28.280
 should call a dual.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:33.280
 Therefore, teacher is kind, qualified teacher.

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:41.230
 And how we conduct with that teacher, with full of joy and devotion, and observe the teaching to

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:47.280
 the heart, not leave that intellectual air we like to get enlightenment.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:54.910
 Air we like to get changed and bloomed our Buddha nature, as we really like to do, have to practice

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:55.280
.

00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:03.620
 And that means observe the heart, with full joy, full of appreciation, full of respect, and full of

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:13.280
 determinations, and also full of loyalty, loyalty to the teaching, loyalty to the practices.

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:22.260
 But strong then, then you will get great results. Exactly as Lunkhima got, exactly as the great Mas

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:30.340
ala Maharaja got, exactly those eight Mahasiddhas of the Indians, or twenty-five disciples of Tibet,

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:32.280
 you will get.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:40.270
 This real attention, achievement is not designated or not owned by someone, or is not driven or not

00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:42.280
 reserved by someone.

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:54.280
 It's open to all. It's our share, our share, our opportunities, our share and our inherent.

00:09:54.280 --> 00:10:02.280
 That we are the scholars. And therefore, then we're there and practice. Practice.

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:10.870
 Again, in the teaching said, that practice of, what is it, teacher is, as I said, guide, guide,

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:14.280
 guiding to, and helping to support.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:21.860
 There's outer guidance and inner guidance. Outer guidance is teacher. Teacher is outer guidance

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:23.280
 that was guiding us.

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:32.280
 Inner guidance is our completion. Our love, our sympathy to both each other, our devotion.

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:41.280
 Those are the inner guidance and courage in commitment. Keep up that with that.

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:48.200
 Combine that our inner guidance and our guided, combined through it, that truly we will become very

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:52.280
 performant, a brain very performant into our lives.

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:57.280
 As all those great practices, past ancient times.

00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:03.280
 And then here, when we do the Guru Yoga, that is His own Durya Mataji.

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:09.540
 So up there, the brain here is the foundation, and I'm going to give last minute of these wonderful

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:10.280
 practices.

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:16.660
 Maybe tomorrow or everywhere. Those people who would like to get this and leaving soon, I will do

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:17.280
 that soon.

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:22.280
 Otherwise, I will give this Saturday. This Saturday is a very special day.

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:27.280
 It's called the Vedyan Buddhism. I think it's dakini.

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:30.280
 So I will do that. At that time, I will be there.

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:34.280
 Last minute. And here. Sit here.

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:57.280
