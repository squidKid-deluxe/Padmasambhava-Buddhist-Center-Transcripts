00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.560
 Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.880
 We continue again. So again, we begin with teaching. The teaching...

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:29.480
 And so, now we continue. Again, the teaching says that, for example, as I said yesterday,

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:38.720
 the Grand Master Vasubendu said in the teaching that to uphold the teaching of the Buddha,

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:48.440
 to benefit to ourselves, then there are two things. That scripture, upholding the scripture

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:55.240
 and upholding the realization or the yah, meaning of that teaching. In order to do that, uphold

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:05.080
 the teaching, then the scripture teaching, again Vasubendu said, studying and contemplation.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.920
 And then upholding the realization or the meaning of that teaching, that means practicing, not

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.920
 just only left on the intellectual level, but really observing that, applying that to

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:23.480
 the heart, and those are known. Then, by that, you are the very beautiful holder of the Buddha

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.960
 Jesus. Anyone who does that, that is what the teaching says. So, in order to begin with

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.920
 that, whether we are studying, whether we are contemplating, whether we are meditating

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:40.160
 or practicing, always, in the teaching, it is activated with the motivations. Motivation

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:48.760
 of those joy and appreciation and both each other. And then, also, by perfect attitude

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:54.040
 and understanding, that which is explained in here, too. But in all, this is like pure

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.600
 land of the Buddha Chhachamunya. In all, great masters are at us. Everyone is really surrounded

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:06.160
 to us, as we have so many beautiful images of that. Not just image, but not just a whole

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.720
 kind of image, but really, truly, as a living great masters, masters kind of feel that we

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.320
 are part of that whole assembly. And with those beautiful thoughts, intention, bodhicata,

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:23.240
 and then we reflect on the teaching. So, yesterday, we discussed the first one, which is the whole

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:30.840
 view of the whole three worlds. And today, we go pacifically now, how that started. And

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:37.240
 that is here, and I think you will, if you look today, but I will again go here, here

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:42.440
 with the root text, and how that began. And that, of course, gracious teacher, Buddha

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.560
 Chhachamunya, it begins with the gracious teacher, Buddha Chhachamunya. Buddha Chhachamunya stayed

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.720
 in the palace for 29 years, and then he left. I won't go over all those details. But, however,

00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:02.360
 Buddha, all major activities are highlighted into 12 deeds that I think everybody heard,

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:09.960
 and we all heard that, and know that. But what are those 12 deeds, such as descending from the

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:10.920
 heaven,

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:17.000
 or to hit the heaven, enter the Chhachamunya, the guardian and the poet, and flaps the shoulder,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.480
 and enter in the, mayadee, which is warm, warm, warm, Chhachamunya, the guardian and the poet,

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.480
 flaps the shoulder, and then taking rebirth, or taking birth, third is I think birth,

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:37.080
 or maybe it first, maybe I missed it. Suppose that from the, to hit the heaven, he transformed as a

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:43.710
 white elephant with six tusks, tusks, so that is the first, and the second is the descending from

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.880
 the,

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:51.800
 from the, to hit the heaven, and third, to the, to the, enter in the, mayadee, which is warm,

00:03:51.800 --> 00:04:00.920
 and then kind of learning all the art and the skills and the knowledge existing at that time,

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:07.000
 the everything that you become very youthful, athletic, and the knowledge for everything,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.640
 and then next one is enjoying the royal palace, or the wedding ceremony,

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:28.120
 married with a queen, and then living, living the kingdom, kingdom, and age 29, and then doing the

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:36.520
 six-year ascetic, ascetic practices, ascetic practices, six years, and then walking toward the

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:45.960
 body tree, and then defeating the old maras and obstacles, and reaching enlightenment,

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:55.320
 and turning will of dharma, and then entering the Mahabharic Naranas, and that is the harmony,

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:02.840
 is 12, yeah, so that is 12. Those are known as a highlighted like activity of the Buddha Chakra,

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:10.360
 which is explained in the, in the book, the book that, in his own real books, and now when he

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:17.400
 reached enlightenment at 35, and according to the very calendar, fourth month, month of the

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:25.800
 daily calendars, and in full moon, and he reached the enlightenment. After that 49 days, he did not

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:31.800
 give the teaching, or seven weeks he did not give any teaching, teachings particularly, and by the

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:42.840
 recursiving of the Indra and the Brahman, then he turned the will of dharma, first time in a

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:52.360
 dear path, modern time is known as Saranath, and that, from that on, then Buddha began to give the

00:05:52.360 --> 00:06:03.640
 teaching. According to Mahayana, that is the great master, that he gave from age 35 until to age 44

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:03.640
,

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:13.720
 sorry 43 or 42, 42 he gave mainly teachings on the Vinaya teachings, Vinaya teachings he gave that.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:21.240
 So that is just the kind of like, or post turning will of dharma, that kind of, or that categorized

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:29.800
 as post turning will of dharma, and post turning will of dharma is mainly teachings on the Vinayas,

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:37.720
 or many teachings on the relative truths, where, how it should be, relative truths. So that is here

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:37.720
,

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:44.200
 here, great master must not depend on the same, so Buddha gave to him, and first we give the

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:52.120
 teaching to that, and principle meaning of the Vinaya is what? Teaching principle meaning of the

00:06:52.120 --> 00:07:00.600
 Vinaya is morality or the conduct. Morality and conduct teachings, and to whom he gave that

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:12.600
 teaching first time is five human students, and 80,000 celestial beings, and as well as many

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.400
 animals

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:19.720
 of the deer box, the deers and so forth, they call the teaching. Because Buddha's teaching is a

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:27.910
 teaching for all living beings, nothing is excluded. As we mentioned yesterday in the Koda teaching

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:28.040
,

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:34.760
 the best thing, the foundation is zhi, what we say zhi is inherited to every living beings.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:42.200
 There's no difference of the zhi or the foundation, which is formally or properly named as Buddha

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:50.840
 nature. Everyone has Buddha nature or waking nature, a wake up nature, everyone, and that wake

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:59.880
 up nature have to be revealed by as that nature of the wake up itself. Nature of wake up is,

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:06.760
 I'm using the wake up, but it's Buddha nature. Nature of Buddha nature is what is the nature,

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:14.840
 it's loving kindness, compassion, wisdom, and when you allow the compassion, wisdom,

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:24.040
 what is grace, harmony, peace, respect, and appreciation to all, everyone. That is the nature

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:30.440
 of the, in call it the radiating energy of this Buddha nature. That what we're talking yesterday,

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:37.400
 zhi, zhi is equal to everyone. Therefore, what Buddha give the teaching, how to reveal that

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:46.120
 cause, how be us in that natural state. And we bring that up there and our all the difficulty

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:54.920
 troubles, sufferings goes away as nightmare goes away. When we begin to wake up or we begin to

00:08:54.920 --> 00:09:03.160
 recognize or that illusion, illusion will be dispelled, removed by itself. So that is what,

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:13.640
 so therefore so many, so many animals also attended to the teachings and 80,000 in the teaching

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:13.800
 said

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:20.920
 the select things, prior human students, prior human students, the name, again, I'm going to

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:29.480
 say the names, names. Post name is Quixi, maybe I see if I can write this, I would have like to

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:33.880
 just have a pronunciation because it is difficult for me.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:10:04.360
 Quixi, Quixi, C-K-U-N-S-H, H and that is, is a long name. Quixi, con dene, co-K-U-co,

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:20.600
 co, maybe co, co, con, co, coni, con, maybe sorry, con dene, con dene, co,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:36.760
 so that is number one, con dene, co, con dene. And then second one is sambolata, T-H-U-L,

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:54.760
 tatara, that is number two, number two, tatara, lanka, l-a-n-g-g-p-a, lanka, three, lanka, mun-chin

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:57.240
, m-i-n-g, mun-chin,

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:06.120
 mun-chin, number four, co, co, con dene, tatara, lanka, mun-chin, sambol.

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:18.840
 So that, that's it, the fifth one, fifth one. So those are the post-pipe students,

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:26.760
 five students, human students. When the teaching said when buddha rated enlightenment and after

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:34.760
 seven weeks and when brahmana entered the corset and please share your nectar, what you achieved,

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:42.360
 please share. And then buddha accepted the corset and he told true home I shall give this nectar,

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:53.160
 share, share this nectar, true home. Among all the individualists, buddha saw these five are

00:11:53.160 --> 00:12:02.520
 ready to mature, ready to mature. That means their karma is less, karma obscurations are less,

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:10.760
 their emotions are less, less. They are also not caught in samsara, busyness and all that. So they

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:18.600
 are kind of everywhere read that they are all that clear, less, less. And then what they have,

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:26.520
 their wisdom is quite sparking. Their also readiness is sparking. Their enthusiasm is sparking.

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:35.480
 Because of that, then buddha saw they are the post-student to share this nectar. So even though

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:43.000
 they in the teaching said that I'm sure you read this, this, and these five are actually like the

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 subject of the buddha. When buddha was king, for instance, their subject. And for king sutta,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:56.440
 the father sutta then very much worried his only son left to the jungle and he really worried that

00:12:56.440 --> 00:13:03.320
 he will have so much difficulty troubles. So he sent so many servants. And buddha returned

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:10.280
 all of those servant go by, I don't need any help. And then he kept because of father so much worry

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:16.840
 that he kept this five, five students. Five students in the teaching said three from the

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:25.160
 father side to from the mother side, he keep this five, five. And when they kept it, they kept it.

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:30.200
 And they are also expressed and restricted to practice. And then there's nothing to do buddha.

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:35.080
 I'm just meditating. So nothing to do that. But then in the teaching said that when they are

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:41.560
 always kind of appreciate how our royal prince is so courageous and so determined,

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:45.560
 committed to what he like to do during the ascetic practice, all that they're really

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:53.080
 nearby they're doing practices. But then in buddha, after six years of ascetic practice,

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:59.960
 he get up from that ascetic practices. And then he went to the religious

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:07.160
 and resilient that delicious milk pudding, rich milk pudding from the beautiful young ladies

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:14.360
 within the golden balls, golden balls. And they says, Oh, now this is a good amount.

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:20.520
 He practice for six years. He didn't achieve something. Now he's falling back to the like,

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:28.440
 the samsara lectures, lectures. He's accepting and accepting such a, this delicious

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:39.240
 pudding from beautiful lady in the golden ball. And I'm sure now he will ask us to do walks and

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:45.960
 keep us busy. And therefore, before he asked us, we should leave. We should leave him. And we go

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:52.520
 away. This otherwise he will really demanding so many things to do for us. He's really now kind of

00:14:52.520 --> 00:15:02.360
 falling apart. So they left. They left quietly, quietly and went to Varanasi. Varanasi. So meantime

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:02.360
,

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:09.800
 Buddha went and had those beautiful delicious rice pudding. And then he, he take the shower.

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:16.280
 Of course he take the shower and the teaching said, and then he have the rice pudding. And then he,

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:23.080
 he throw that golden ball in the, in the Narayanjana River, which is Narayanjana River runs near

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:23.160
 the

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:30.290
 Bodhgaya. Bodhgaya is still there in the river. And he throw that, and that moment that ender

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:30.600
 picked

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:37.240
 up that ball and talk to the guards to hear the heavens in the teaching said, to hear the heavens.

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:45.640
 And then Buddha, when the Buddha granted that, the mug, this mug, mug pudding, and his compilations

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:45.800
 and

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:53.800
 this just completely changed. He becomes then the, the brilliant brightness of that 32 major marks

00:15:53.800 --> 00:16:01.640
 and 38 manual marks began to shine. So perfectly beautiful and become the golden colors. Perfectly

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:09.800
 beautiful. Then, so that after that, then he went to the, get enlightenment. So that's the story of

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:09.960
 the

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:15.960
 five of these students. So now, when Buddha saw, they are ready everywhere, ready to receive the

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:23.720
 past teaching and Buddha went to Varanasi. And when Varanasi came and he heard, they heard

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:31.160
 that Buddha is coming to Sarnath or the modern time Sarnath, ancient time Deva. He's coming there

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:38.280
 and therefore now because he's like, since we left, he's chasing us and he will demanding us to go,

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:44.840
 to put us in war, war. So we should just going to ignore him when he comes to us. We're going to

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:49.960
 ignore, we're not going to speak, we're not going to even look to him. Okay. And we're going to

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:50.440
 play

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:57.960
 what they call the sole person game. That's really like, like the series looking, we're going to do

00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:06.680
 that. They met that kind of angry that among them. So now Buddha is walking toward them. The moment

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:15.000
 they see the Buddha, it's just glowing. It's just radiating. And that couldn't keep their,

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:23.560
 what they discussed. They won't receive it. They won't complete it. And somebody, some are get up

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:29.800
 and oh, you welcome. You look so beautiful. What happened to you? And all that, what happened? And

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:36.040
 sit here and they kind of receiving him and offering the seat and all these things. And they said,

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:41.400
 what do you, what do you, what you just looks gotama. And the Buddha said, another client,

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:46.840
 client name is the gotama. He said, gotama, you look so beautiful. You look just changed.

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:55.560
 What that happened to you? And Buddha said, should not call me gotama. I am the waking ones. Call

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:55.960
 me

00:17:55.960 --> 00:18:03.290
 waking ones. Call me waking ones. And so should not call me. And I said, I reached the

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:03.880
 enlightenment.

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:09.720
 I've got the perfect realizations. Now I'm going to share to you that. So then they walked,

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:15.880
 walked together from that where they meeting supporters to Sarnath or the, where they,

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:21.240
 this modern times, if you went to Sarnath, you see there's like sport, sport where,

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:27.320
 where they give the teachings. And also there's like the place that in India, Varanasi, there's

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:32.760
 sport where the first time, five students and Buddha met, met first time. That sport, they met

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:39.000
 beautiful monuments. Later maybe came, I showed all who ever met that. And our course is ruined,

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.360
 ruined that. So walk there and give the first teachings. And first teaching was vulnerable

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:50.200
 truth teachings. For noble truth teachings, among that vulnerable truth teachings, Buddha said

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:50.600
 first

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:56.440
 for noble truth teaching and which is vulnerable truth teaching is, I mean, you all know that

00:18:56.440 --> 00:19:02.680
 suffering truth, cause of suffering truth and the cessation, part, cessation of truth and part

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:03.240
 truth.

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:09.880
 When Buddha said the first time, that one time of that and that moment, this kunshi,

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:19.160
 kundini, kundini, he become the Ahad. Immediately, he really reached, immediately the realization.

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:28.600
 So in the teaching said that time in the world, there is officially two Ahadas, first is the Buddha

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:36.200
 and second is this one, kushi kundini. And kushi means and even he said all great teacher,

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:41.400
 I understand everything he said. I understand everything. Kushi in the Tibetan world means,

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:49.800
 I under, not I, I know all. I and all understood, all understood kushi. So he's never announced

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:57.080
 the kushi kundini. Then Buddha repeat the part three times that that and we need to repeat the

00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:04.520
 third term, all this rest whole become the Ahad, reach the realization instantly. So those are

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:04.680
 known

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:13.320
 six Ahadas, Buddha and five students. So that is what it is. Then Buddha meet the continual

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:13.960
 teachings

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:21.080
 on the Vinaya teachings. Vinaya teaching is what? I said principle meaning of the Vinaya teaching

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:30.040
 is moralities. But generally, entire Buddha teaching has three principle meanings. Those are known

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:30.200
 as
