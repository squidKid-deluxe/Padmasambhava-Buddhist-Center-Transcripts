 Again, another great Terton, which is Lady Terton. But her, she came very early. So really,

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:24.480
 these teachings are not so much existing, kind of like disabled. But however, he was one of the

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:24.800
 very

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:35.760
 famous Lady Terton, and her name is, I think maybe you heard or not, and her name is Jomo Menmo,

 or the real name, her name is Jomo Menmo, it's called a nickname, and the real name is Pima Tsogy.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:25.520
 Pima is you know, Tsogy, T-S-O, and Tsogy, C-H-I-D, Tsogy, or C-H-E-D, either way, Pima Tsogy.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:41.760
 And he was emanation of the Yichin Togya, her soul, her soul, soul. And he came in the 13th century

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.760
,

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:55.840
 century, and 1248 came, 1248, Jomo Menmo. And so, and that how that explaining,

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:04.240
 teaching, and how all of them are teaching, said, and that is which is in the, in the,

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.760
 what, in the Gopin Masambas, the Yichin Togya is saying, in the 8th century. In the future,

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:22.240
 there is one beautiful porcelain girl, born in the monkey ear, monkey ear, which is blessed by the

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:31.200
 rakinis. And she was a kind of human, as a hidden Yogini, Yogini, her name also could be Jomo, Jomo

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.280
.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:42.000
 At that time, these teachings will be revealed and shared by her to the others and get

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.640
 lot of realizations. At that time, maybe she won't do too many activities with this,

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:56.160
 but whoever connected to this teaching, they will go to the building of the great blissfulness.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:04.480
 And many, also people who practice it, they can reach, reach enlightenment without leaving

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:13.360
 warning behind. That's what the teaching said. As it said, said, and then he was born in this

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:25.640
 1248 and also in the center Tibet, center Tibet, and father's name was Maka Duryajarpur and mother

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.760

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:34.960
 name was Pima Pandan, Pandan. And father was also Maka, Maka, mother was has large beautiful nature

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:47.840
 call it. And both parents gave this young girl's name Pima Sotint, as I said, and her family was

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:58.560
 not rich, not poor. And but however, at the age of five, mother passed away, mother passed away,

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:09.440
 and the father remarried it, remarried it. And then soon after, the family asked her to look up the

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:18.320
 animals, animals. And she's working hard, hard, hard, hard jobs as like almost a kind of attendance

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:27.680
 of the families. This, this, this, so she becomes a little bit difficult. And one time at age 13,

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:36.960
 when she reached age 13, nearby her, nearby her house, or the village, there is beautiful again,

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:48.800
 there is like Rocky Mountain, again known as Garuda Line Rocky Mountain.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:58.640
 And there is very old sugar cave, which is the known sugar cave of Muruga Masambhaka. So he was

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:08.480
 around age 30. And she, she is an animal, he's a grating, grating animal in the springtime. And

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:15.350
 then after he grazed the animals, animals, she rest a little bit, and he fall asleep, he fall

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.680
 asleep.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:23.430
 When he fall asleep, sleep, and she in this in a dream, no, no, not dream, sorry, when he fall

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.920
 asleep,

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:33.040
 and then from that Rocky Mountain, or from that cave, there is such beautiful song came, the music

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:40.800
 came because of that, I woke up, I'm sorry, she's still sleeping, but that song wake up,

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:48.080
 song wake up, song wake up. And that stroke, the cave is kind of completely wide open,

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:55.600
 open. And her mind is completely changed. And they know, particularly, they know,

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:02.160
 immediately she got up and walked in that cave. When she came inside the cave,

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:09.520
 there's the beautiful, prideful display of the cemeteries. So kind of frightful,

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:18.240
 every fist for kind of displays, all is in that cave. When she then, when we entered in that cave,

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:23.760
 cave, and this prideful, yet there is so many dakinis, so many ladies gathered,

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:29.760
 they performed in the big Ganachakra ceremonies, soft ceremonies.

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:39.520
 And middle of that, that Ganachakra fist, there was that ladies, that woman, and there is the

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:40.240
 principle

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:49.990
 dakini is the Vaidyavaras. She is still, and Vaidyavaras is all noble daughter, welcome, welcome

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:50.080
 you.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:59.500
 And she said that, and in backside of her hair, in backside of her hair in Rocky Mountain, she both

00:06:59.500 --> 00:06:59.600
,

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:10.640
 both small, volume, volume, and put in Pima Tsoji's head. And I'm giving you the complete

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:19.840
 empowerment, transmission, with instruction, all that in one single status. And she said that,

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:28.800
 and she put in her hair. And she also handed it to her. This is your treasures. Treasures,

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:36.320
 you must take care of this teaching very secretly, quietly, and you will achieve the

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:46.640
 highest realizations, and then, and benefit. That she said, and then she become naturally,

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:53.040
 kind of wake it up, she becomes part of all that gatherings, gathering all that ladies,

00:07:53.040 --> 00:08:00.800
 ladies. And she joined with Chokusei Moon and Ganachakra fist, fist. She enjoyed all that.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:10.000
 After that, all that, this, all that displays a completely, kind of merged completely. And she,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:18.000
 then she went, came out and looking, looked after the animals, and she went, she went back to her

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:24.800
 home with the animals even. Because of that circumstances of that presence, her attitude,

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:32.640
 her kind of activities are not become same as before, before. She's singing occasionally,

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:39.200
 probably singing, dancing, and then as well as also she's reading the mind where others

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:45.360
 kind of instantly telling them this and that, that things. And all the villages, everyone says,

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:51.760
 oh, she's become some, completely something wrong now. She's become cuckoo, cuckoo. And because in

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:59.640
 that area, there is called Danapala, the mountain deed, you know, the chomu bimu, chomu bimu. And

00:08:59.640 --> 00:08:59.760
 so

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:07.600
 means the lady, lady of the bimu. I mean, that's to be the name. In the mountain deed, there's,

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:14.000
 that mountain area is like one, invisible, where he goes like, representing or had that. And so,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.760
 kind of every village that you used to, she's so powerful, that invisible deed is so powerful.

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:26.800
 And that's why this, this chomu bimu, that mountain deed, female mountain deed goddesses,

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:36.000
 influenced this bimu bimu. That's why she's become kind of a regular attitudes, attitudes.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:43.200
 And so then, then Nick named her chomu bimu, which is the name of that mountain deed.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:50.000
 Because of all those reasons, she didn't feel really comfortable to stay in her abilities.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:56.080
 She decided to go different place. And she came to the center, again,

00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:00.720
 center to bed, looked up. That way, Renan was born in that area.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:08.880
 Area, and she met, then, the bimus, this tekum, that way, other day, we're talking, the Renan

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:14.240
 pakopi of that life story of Gaurapai Masambhava, which is the demo of Gaurapai Masambhava. So,

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:20.880
 she met Gaurapai Masambhava. The moment she met Gaurapai Masambhava, she accidentally burst up the

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:32.240
 inborn, great, wisdom, blasphemous. And also, Gaurapai Masambhava, Gaurapai Masambhava,

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:32.720
 she and Gaurapai Masambhava, she and Gaurapai Masambhava, she and Gaurapai Masambhava, she and

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:39.980
 Gaurapai Masambhava, she and Gaurapai Masambhava, she and Gaurapai Masambhava, she and Gaurapai Mas

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:40.160
ambhava,

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:45.140
 she and Gaurapai Masambhava, she and Gaurapai Masambhava, she and Gaurapai Masambhava, she and Gaur

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:47.520
apai Masambhava,

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:50.720
 she and Gaurapai Masambhava, she and Gaurapai Masambhava, she and Gaurapai Masambhava, she and

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:58.030
 Gaurapai Masambhava, she and Gaurapai Masambhava, she and Gaurapai Masambhava, she and Gaurapai Mas

00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:58.720
ambhava,

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:06.720
 she stayed quite a long time with him, with him and teaching and practicing that.

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:14.430
 And then, Guru Ching Hai said, great that Guru Ching Hai said, what you discover, this teaching is,

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:18.720
 is truly, is your Yixin Surya say,

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:26.670
 that their heart practices, her personal heart practices with your previous birth or previous

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:27.720
 incarnation, Yixin Surya,

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:35.860
 and it is another time to immediately to share that with others, keep this sickly and practice by

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:36.720
 yourself.

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:44.720
 Now you go different areas of the will and some, and as much as you can benefit to the others

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:45.720
 through that,

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:55.720
 that you must help. You help. In the end, you will go will and without your living body behind.

00:11:55.720 --> 00:12:02.120
 So he said that, he gave instructions to you. And then, because of that, then he went all the

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:03.720
 different places,

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:11.720
 up to the mountain, near the Kelechi Mountains, and to all that. And then he also met that time,

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:19.720
 that time, Bhimusu, Dhupakaji Master, known as Lingyalepa, Riva, she met him.

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:29.880
 And also that instantly increased her realization, as well as his also realization is bursted,

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:31.720
 bursted, and bursted.

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:37.720
 And so she really kind of stayed as hidden in Yogini and benefiting to all the beings,

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:46.680
 means through her conduct, through her activities, and he kept these teachings, teachings very sick

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:46.720
ly.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:58.720
 And at 35, at 35, he and her three disciples came to the center of the Dari Mountain.

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:04.720
 Mountain, in the mountain, they all came, and they did a big ceremony of the Ganachakra.

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:14.720
 And the Ganachakra, once that ceremony is completed, and all of that flew away in the sky,

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:23.720
 and to the Kapaglori Mountains. And that area, many cow herds, saw that, what happened, they saw,

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:29.720
 and then suddenly they came to that area, where they leapt up in the sky.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:34.720
 They saw there's a lot of, many left our pools, and they had those pools.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:39.720
 Immediately, they were able to stay in the beautiful merit of the status.

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:45.720
 So this is what, how she described, they came.

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:54.720
 And even though her teachings are, this event, that time, kind of so long time ago,

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:57.720
 there's no continuation, many holders of that.

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:04.720
 But however, in the 19th century, or early 19th century, and, no, not early 19th century,

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:10.720
 but in the 19th century, in the 19th century, this famous theorem, the post-Chenze,

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:13.720
 as I'm talking yesterday, [inaudible]

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:20.720
 of post-Chenze, then he able to rediscover this head, that teaching,

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:25.720
 which he handed by the [inaudible]

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:33.720
 He's able to rediscover, and he gave the teachings, transmissions to post-control,

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:35.720
 and as well as many others.

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:41.720
 And then now, which he is, is within the collection of the treasure,

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:45.720
 the [inaudible] treasure collections that teachings are existing.

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:51.720
 So this is the life story of the great [inaudible]

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:53.720
 or the [inaudible]

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.720
 [inaudible]

00:14:55.720 --> 00:15:00.720
 So that's, that's the one.

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:03.720
 Now I want to talk about another one, because she is so early,

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:06.720
 and there's no personal experience that she wrote.

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:11.720
 But I'll talk again, maybe another one, which came recently.
