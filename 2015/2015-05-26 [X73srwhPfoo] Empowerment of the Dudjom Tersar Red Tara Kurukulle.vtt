00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.770
 Good morning. Thank you. Good morning. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. You're welcome.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:08.000
 Thank you.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.190
 And as you all know, this morning I'm offering the involvement of the Western Dakini Kurukulli, a

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:30.000
 current lineage of the His Holiness Dudjom Rinpoche, who was one of the great masters in the region

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 of the Murappear Masambhava, and a great teacher, the master of the 41st, 20th century.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 And so, the following is a lineage I'm offering to the involvement of the Kurukulli.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 Before to begin the involvement of the lineage teaching, I'm going to give brief introductions.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.170
 Again, of course, before we give the introduction, or give the introduction, we should re-stand our

00:00:49.170 --> 00:01:04.580
 virtual motivation of the bodhijeta, the vastness motivation of the bodhijeta, and as well as also

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:04.670
 purely the motivation of the Vedayana teaching, kind of combined, targeted to the motivation, which

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:05.000
 is the foundation, the very foundation of the empowerment and the teaching.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 And also important to benefit all beings.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.420
 So therefore, how are we going to think that today I'm going to receive the empowerment of the Kuru

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:19.460
kulli, which is the mother of all the Buddhas that I'm going to receive this empowerment, in order

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.000
 to benefit to all living beings.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.710
 And not just only benefit it, but bring everyone to the enlightened state, to their ordinary

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.000
 natural status.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.220
 And with that thought that I'm going to receive the empowerment, and also mature my mind, and

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.000
 liberate every living being with that beautiful thought in the heart and mind.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.180
 At the same time, the Vedayana motivation, which is Vedayana teaching, is known as the three Vedya

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.000
 status.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 Everything is enlightened status, Vedaya form, Vedaya song, Vedaya mind, and space status.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 So bring up those realizations there.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.070
 And now, with that thought, I will be very introduction, which is part of his own, his own teaching

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.000
.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.740
 So I will go roughly this translation, things, and just tell you that how the great master, his own

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.000
, he said, which is his Vedya world, his blessed world.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 It's not just a conceptualized world composed by the different kind of sources of photography.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 It is his enlightenment nature.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 It is his enlightenment world that reflected into this way.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 So I will again go really in that, in that, according to that senses.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 And what you're going to receive today is the teaching of the Vedayana teachings.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 Again, this is the teaching of the Buddha Shakyamuni, originally.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 Buddha Shakyamuni came in this world 2,600 years ago.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.650
 Give variety teachings to all the disciples and send it based according to their need, according to

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:54.000
 their readiness.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 You give the teachings.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 Those old teachings can be summarized into nayana teachings.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 Nayana teachings, this teaching belongs to the Vedayana teachings.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.910
 The old Vedayana teachings can be divided into two groups, which is known as outer dhanthara

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.000
 teaching and dhanthara teachings.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 This is an dhanthara teaching.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:25.090
 An dhanthara teaching is known as Mahayoga teaching, Anoyoga teaching, Adiyoga teaching, or Pada D

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.000
hanthara, Mother Dhanthara, neutral dhanthara.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:33.200
 And among those teachings, this is, in a way, really combination of all that inner dhanthara

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.000
 teaching, inner dhanthara teaching, and highlight with the Anoyoga teachings.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 And then, together with the Adiyoga teachings, so that, and this, so.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:49.280
 And among that teaching, as I said, this is like, as there is Pada Dhanthara, Mother Dhanthara, and

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.000
 neutral dhanthara, this is Mother Dhanthara.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 Mother Dhanthara is a teaching of the worship of Dakinis.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 And generally, there is no difference between male Buddha and female Buddha.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 Everyone is in light and steady, all this.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.670
 But however, according to the scopes of the Vedayana teachings, male Buddha is more represented as

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:17.000
 a skillful means, and female Buddha is more represented as a worship aspect of the teachings.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 So therefore, for us, for us, what we need?

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 We need more wisdom so that we can understand the skillful meanings.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 Therefore, in the Buddha's teaching, often said, Mother of all the Buddhas, the Pandya Paravata,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:38.570
 and as well as all, because all Buddhas reach enlightenment because of knowing the nature of the

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:39.000
 worship.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 They are knowing the nature of the great answer that Muslims and just Mother Pandya Paravata.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 In that sense, the wisdom is very important.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.560
 For us, because we are very much deluded, generally mostly, as deluded by the kind of surface

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:00.000
 activities of the skillful means, the spirit of the nature, we cannot carry with that force.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 And because we didn't have enough wisdom, can't get just to that realization.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 So therefore, in that sense, wisdom is very important.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 So therefore, again, this is one of the very important practices.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 And then, generally, what the Gurukali is then totally enlightening.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 It's also not just a past Buddha or future Buddha, it is living Buddhas.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 This Buddha can be understood in three different levels.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 Dharmakaya level, Sambokaya level, and Dharmakaya levels.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.590
 Dharmakaya level is the Buddha's Sambodha Badris or the great Mother Pandya Paravata, which is

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:45.180
 beyond the conception, beyond the complex cities, as a transcendental organ in nature, unbound, un

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.000
ceasing, un-natural in the by-sky.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:55.550
 As Buddha Shakyamuni said, or as great Master Rahula said in his teachings, so that is where nature

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:56.000
 is.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 This nature is residing all the time.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 Whether we understand this nature or whether we didn't recognize this nature of Dharmakaya,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 nature is always here with us, and that is the pervasive nature.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 Every way we don't have any ideologies, that is what its essence of that nature is.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 No, that's the meaning of the great wisdom and compassion.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.110
 Great wisdom, compassion, combined flow, in the transcendental, what's the nature state as

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:28.000
 transcendental, what's the language or what's the state.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 So that is Mother Dharmakaya Buddha of the Guru-Gurus.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:38.610
 From that nature state, as such, it is the union of the wisdom and compassion, and then arises such

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:46.720
 an active energy, active energy, unceasing colleges, and that is not as then, like Sambokaya Budd

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:53.300
has, such as Pimann Buddhas, Sambokaya, Pyaapai, Dhyana Buddhas, all those are the Sambokaya Buddhas

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.000
 of the Mother Guru-Gurus.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:01.890
 And which is a combination of the wisdom and compassion, more actively engaging the clarity of the

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:04.000
 compassion, arising energy,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:10.190
 and helping to all the sentient beings, but regularly those highly enlightened state beings that

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:12.000
 are class meeting, teaching,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 toward the symbolic class mission of the energy systems, to all the enlightened beings.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:24.010
 And from that Sambokaya status, then arises such a great Muslim Rakhini, Rakhini, and in order to

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:26.000
 benefit all the living beings, again, Ramakaya Buddhas,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:33.400
 such as one emanation of Taras and so forth, all those Muslim Rakhinis are the Muslim Ramakaya

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.000
 status.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 Among that, this which is also Mother emanation of the Mother Guru-Gurus.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:46.750
 So therefore, again, Mother Guru-Kulay is the embodiment of all three Gaius. Gaius and she

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:47.000
 represent all.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 And particularly what she represents in Mother Guru-Kulay, representing all Sambokaya energy, Samb

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:54.000
okaya nature,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
 which is also known other than the Buddha Amitabhas and Amitayas.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 Amitayas, Amitabha emanation, so many Buddhas emanations one after another,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:11.780
 and then this is also also the emanation of the Amitabha, or is another Sambokaya status of the

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:13.000
 Mother Taras.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 And so this is the brilliant understanding of the Mother Guru-Kulay, and he is, then, as he said,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 the embodiment of all,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:31.240
 or as he is known to do, he is the nature of the Padia Paramata, and which is the Dharmakaya state

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:34.000
 of the Mother Kuru-Kulay.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:40.380
 In Sambokaya state, he is known as, then, five Nayan female Buddhas, which is also surrounded by so

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:42.000
 many female Buddhas,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 and as well as male Buddhas. And then in the Makaya state, many different emanations,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:54.830
 and such as the Tara, and a re-emination of the Tara, known as, then, or Kuru-Kulay, known as, then

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:55.000
,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:01.000
 question of Dakini, Hidsoja, and so forth, all this is. So that is really about the Kuru-Kulay.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 Then this teaching, where this teaching come from, as I said, is come from the Buddha-Kakamuni,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000
 but who bought this teaching to the, to the, to the Tibetan, is then great master,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.460
 Gaurapayama Sambokaya, who bought these teachings, teaching to the Tibetan at century, and Gaurapay

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:17.000
ama Sambokaya,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:23.990
 a variety, a variety of teachings, so many different teachings, but this is one of the very essence

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:24.000
 teachings

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 of the Gaurapayama Sambokaya, and he shared two, many, two, so many disciples,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.540
 particularly among the twenty-five, or particularly twenty-five disciples from Gaurapayama Sambok

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:34.000
aya.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 Particularly this teaching came to then, to the great, one of the twenty-five disciples, known as D

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:41.000
obi Chechong Nosa,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 Dobi Chechong Nosa, and he received this instruction, so this is like, the hard practice of the,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 hard practice of the Gaurapayama Sambokaya and the person of Dakini Hidsoja,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:02.500
 and previously, ideally, over-handed to the great master and their disciples, such as the Dobi Che

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:03.000
chong Nosa.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:09.000
 So, Dobi Chechong Nosa was the predecessor of his own, Dobi Chechong Nosa,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000
 and so he was one of the twenty-five disciples of the Gaurapayama Sambokaya.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:21.000
 So, as Dobi Chechong Nosa incarnated so many great, one after another,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 and throughout the great history, or the Nima history, and then, among those reincarnations,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 his only Dobi Chechong Nosa, one of the great reincarnations of growing Chechong Nosa.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000
 And in the teaching also said, his only Dobi Chechong Nosa,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 the body emanation of the Chechong Nosa, and the speech emanation of the Gaurapayama Sambokaya,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 and the mind emanation of the Gaurapayama Sambokaya himself.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:56.250
 So, the three great enlightened beings come together, one single state as his own Dobi Chechong N

00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:57.000
osa,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 and his own Dini Rupachis, and how he discovered his teachings.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 And again, I will briefly talk that as his own words, that which is again he said that.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000
 And here, in the teaching, his own Dini Rupachis have said that.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 I want, I who is recognized as the reincarnation of the Dini Rupachis,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:29.000
 which means the predecessor of his own Dini Rupachis, now I am known as Jugra Yishidori,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000
 all known as also given by the Gaurapayama Sambokaya as a name to me,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 is Kaurui Raunal Nanga.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000
 And I had beautiful connections in the past lives to the Gaurapayama Sambokaya,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
 and the Gaurapayama Sambokaya nation.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:50.000
 Therefore, throughout the lifetimes, I was compassioningly, kindly,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:56.000
 they observed, and they carried me, carried me all the times.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 And I had also, therefore, I had beautiful Karmic donations.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
 I had beautiful Karmas.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 And since they have been so kind throughout the lifetimes,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 they carried me all the time, and since I was born as a child,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000
 I had such great devotion, unfailing devotion to him,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000
 to Gaurapayama Sambokaya, and indestructible devotions.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 And, and appreciation to them.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000
 Because of that, also in this life, that was his own Dini Rupachis talking,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 I received so many times, signs and blessings,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
 that received so many times, again and again, sign of their blessings.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:41.000
 And then, also, I was predicted by Gaurapayama Sambokaya himself.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
 In the teaching, he said, in the Gaurapayama Sambokaya's own prejudice,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000
 that means, 8th century, Gaurapayama Sambokaya predicted upcoming

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 the great teacher of his Dini Rupachis in the 21st, sorry, 20 centuries,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 the beginning of 20 centuries.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 He said, in the future, future, like in parts,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 sorry, maybe I should say this way, in the far east,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000
 east, that means Samyen, monastery is as central locations in the debate,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 and major in from there, in the different directions.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
 From the east direction of the Samyen monastery, if I use,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 and passing nine glacial mountains,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 there is naturally imitated pure land of the Vaidyavarahi,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000
 sacred land, which is referring to the Pimaku.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 Hidden land of Pimaku is always referred as Vaidyayovini, sacred lands.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:40.000
 And that pure land, in that land, they will be named Jhana,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 Jhana, which is dibraj seat of the Yishi, is named as Jhana.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
 And the one who had the name Jhana,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 and he is the emanation of the Ravi, Chachamalosa,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 welcome the bird in the same family of the cactus of Debzi,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
 and he will be maintained the Vaidyana vows,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 or Vaidyana vows of the crazy Vasnu activities.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 The activities, even his activities are not so always,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 he can't relax regularly, and then he will carry,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 as the kind of the very Vasnu yogi star, yogi star activities.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
 And it will reveal the new dharma,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 and at the same time, we will protect it,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 and preserve it, and spread it, the ancient dharma teachings.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000
 Whoever according to this teacher, these beings,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 will go to the pure land of the Gopaglorimond,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 or Gopagmasabha pure land.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
 That was the predicted by the Gopagmasabha.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 As, this is his only religion, he said, "As you see that, see it?"

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000
 And I had many opportunities when I was young.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.000
 Many of those rocket of the three rocket came in my mind, head,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 so many times, so many times.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
 Particularly when I was 13 years old,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 old I had directly vegan,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000
 direct vegan of the sea in Gopagmasabha,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:08.000
 some of them, and also played with many young girls.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 Some of them I had, we all played.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000
 They handed me, me directly, again,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 clearly open stairs, many scored peppers,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
 yellow scored peppers, peppers.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 And as well as upper world, I had many times,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 that similar experience, similar kind of like,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 occurence, occurence, many times.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 But however, due to the situation and circumstances

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 and prejudice, I can't really neglect it.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 Just because of those old reasons,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
 I can't really neglect it to remove the new dharma.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
 And so I guess that, and then therefore,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 all these yellow scored peppers, many of them,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 I offered to them, (speaks in foreign language)

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 (speaks in foreign language)

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
 (speaks in foreign language)

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 I offered.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 Offered, that means, is the female Buddha.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
 Female Buddha of the west.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
 West, (speaks in foreign language)

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
 and which also referring to the pie,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
 so he offered to the pie.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 According, of course, realization level,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000
 old, again, as we speak about the Vedayana teachings,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
 in the Vedayana teachings, five aggregates,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 the five dying Buddha, five elements,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000
 the five people Buddha.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
 Among the element, pie is (speaks in foreign language)

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.000
 or the (speaks in foreign language)

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
 So he offered to the (speaks in foreign language)

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 And after that, I decided to continue to preserve it

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
 and spreading the (speaks in foreign language)

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
 dharma teachings, and as well as other Buddha teachings,

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
 and I won't make effort to remove the new dharma.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
 Then my thought, I thought, that's what I will do.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
 With that thought, I said,

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 but however, when I reached the age of 25,

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000
 five and 25, and the 25th day,

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
 the (speaks in foreign language)

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
 and the Yogi, (speaks in foreign language)

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 who was one of the very famous, again,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
 Yogi and the disciple of his (speaks in foreign language)

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.000
 himself.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000
 He received the indication and encouragement

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 from the (speaks in foreign language)

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
 and then he came suddenly to me, asked me,

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
 "You have to revere the Dakini teachings.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
 "Dakini teaching, you have to revere right now."

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 I heard that Thurya Durya was very kind of a powerful,

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 powerful, even yet he is disciple of his (speaks in foreign language)

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
 but he is very kind of like,

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
 "He like to do things very fast and quick,

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
 "quick as you don't like to delete."

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 So he came kind of forcefully right in front of

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 his (speaks in foreign language)

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000
 and asked, "You have to revere the Dakini teachings."

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000
 And so then he said, "You have to revere."

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000
 And as he said that earlier to me, kind of earlier to me,

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
 and all this teaching what he wrote

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 came clearly in my voice and mind.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 Clearly came, and then I described that in the one sitting

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000
 and handed it to him and he taught that so dearly,

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 dearly, and he went to the single room,

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 came in a Yadong chapter in the center of it.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.000
 It's the one of the very famous, famous cave

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000
 where (speaks in foreign language)

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 and as well as a great translator, (speaks in foreign language)

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 is also this, the one where he's really blessed,

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000
 where he reached enlightenment and realization

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000
 of where (speaks in foreign language)

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000
 status or where (speaks in foreign language)

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000
 status.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000
 So, he went there and did the retreat.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000
 And as he did the retreat, he got a lot of signs

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 and indications of realization of these teachings

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.000
 that he did.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 And then he come back again,

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
 "You have to revere all these teachings."

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000
 As he originally, and then he revere all,

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
 this is one after another, this Dharma teaching,

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000
 and this is what all of these teachings are,

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.000
 related with the (speaks in foreign language)

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 related with the Dakini, Dakini.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000
 So, that is the brief, kind of, history of how

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
 he's only to the (speaks in foreign language)

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
 revere these teachings.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 And from this cycle of the teaching,

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000
 it has a lot of practice, a lot of teachings.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
 It's like (speaks in foreign language)

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 It has a lot of practices.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000
 Among that, this is one of the great teaching,

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000
 is called the Kaurukula teaching,

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.000
 and the Kaurukula practices,

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
 that what I'm offering you to do.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 And then this, so therefore, again, of course,

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000
 in the Myanmar schools of Tibetan Buddhism,

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000
 there's the (speaks in foreign language)

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
 and of course, Tibetan is mostly Buddhism.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 Among Tibetan Buddhism, there is a four-grade schools,

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 and among that is the (speaks in foreign language)

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.000
 (speaks in foreign language)

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000
 There is two different major lineages,

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.000
 as many of you know, those are known as the Kama lineage,

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000
 the Therma lineage, and this particular teaching

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000
 is as we discussed already, is Therma lineage.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000
 And this is the, this teaching,

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000
 reverent by a great (speaks in foreign language)

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000
 and the region of (speaks in foreign language)

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
 as we're speaking that.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
 And as he reverent this teaching,

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000
 he shared the first time to this (speaks in foreign language)

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
 and as well as (speaks in foreign language)

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000
 he shared this teaching, gave two minutes disciples,

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000
 and I was one of those 14 disciples,

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 a student had the opportunity to direct this teaching

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000
 from his own (speaks in foreign language)

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
 and as well as received this teaching

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000
 from also (speaks in foreign language)

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000
 and so many other (speaks in foreign language)

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.000
 so this is the brief history of how this teaching came.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:45.000
 And now, so that is what history and this teaching

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000
 or within this (speaks in foreign language)

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 then I will offer the empowerment

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000
 that which is known as maturing the mind

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000
 or maturing our (speaks in foreign language)

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000
 so that is the brilliant history

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000
 and as his own teachings,

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000
 that I follow the kind of roughly translation,

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000
 so now with that understanding,

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 then we follow that the empowerment

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
 or the ceremony itself

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000
 and so now,
