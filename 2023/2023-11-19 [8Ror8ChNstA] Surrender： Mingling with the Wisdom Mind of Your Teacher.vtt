00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.440
 Thank you, friends. Thank you. Always. Thanks for joining. As we know, we have like a fleeting

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:24.140
 little shared time together. It's always so impermanent. And somehow we have the conditions

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:31.880
 to come together to be here, to reflect on the living teachings of the Buddha right now.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.840
 So as we do that, to make ourselves kind of really receptive or kind of ripe or attuned

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.720
 to the living Dharma, the living nature of reality. And there's always these three things

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.840
 we do with our heart and our mind, these three motivations. So first, we turn on our joy

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:56.160
 and appreciation, our gratitude, our renunciation mind, really bring up a sense of being grateful,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:14.400
 supported, nourished. I've really highlight the wonderful things we have going for ourselves.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.040
 And secondly, we bring up the idea that this path, this time, this reflection is not fundamentally

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:26.680
 about me. It's about all beings. We try to really turn our mind with kind of genuine

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:34.840
 kindness and concern for all beings. So we all want to be happy. Every single moment,

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.880
 we're doing something to try to be happy. And no one wants to suffer. And so, like we're

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.480
 going for refuge, we're bringing up this gratitude, we're really trying to connect to the Dharma

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.640
 so that we can actually become enlightened and therefore like have the ability to really

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:57.800
 help beings, to serve beings in skillful ways. So this bodhicitta, this heart mind of enlightenment

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.800
,

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:04.080
 try to really turn that on. It's such a rare thing, a rare moment to actually try to intentionally

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:14.080
 consciously turn on bodhicitta. I'm here breathing, thinking, reflecting right now so that I can

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:38.640
 become enlightened so all beings will be free of suffering. And thirdly, generate a pure

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:47.600
 perception. I know it can be hard to do. We're sometimes called sacred outlook, or the three

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.480
 vajras, pure body, pure speech, pure mind. So temporarily, we're kind of like suspending

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:59.960
 our disbelief and entertaining the possibility, actually with kind of like a little bit of

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:12.040
 a delightful kind of like presence. Everything I see is actually the guru, is Padmasambhava.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:23.000
 Everything I hear is Padmasambhava. All the movements of my mind are Padmasambhava. Everything's

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.330
 body of Guru Rinpoche. Everything's sound of Guru Rinpoche. Everything's wisdom mind of Guru Rinp

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.600
oche.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:39.080
 There's nothing that can happen that's not Guru Rinpoche. We boldly try to turn on that view. Pure

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:45.880
 perception. Everything is sacred. It's all the wisdom mind, body, speech, Guru Padmasambhava.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:57.000
 You can turn that on with the great bodhicitta.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:44.960
 So the topic today is called surrender, mingling with the wisdom mind of the teacher. Surrender,

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:58.000
 mingling with the wisdom mind of the teacher. So this in general is a topic of guru yoga.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.880
 This is a heart practice. This is the beating heart practice of all the highest teachings

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:14.520
 of Buddhism. Zogchen, Mahamudra, all these teachings, these heart essence teachings taught

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:26.520
 by the Buddha and Guru Rinpoche. Inseparable, it's always about the inseparable connection to the

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:35.040
 guru, to the teacher. The wisdom mind of the teacher. All, I mean just anything I've come across,

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:42.400
 all the teachings of Venerable Kambhramachas, there's always the heart, guru yoga, mingling

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:47.920
 with the wisdom mind of the teacher. So this is the topic we're going to explore a little

00:05:47.920 --> 00:06:08.920
 bit today. Surrender, mingling with the wisdom mind of the teacher. Vajrayana is bold. It's

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:18.320
 easy to say three vajras. It's easy to say everything's pure. It's all sacred. It's easy

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:28.800
 until it's not. Every single thing that happens to us is the activity of Guru Padmasambhava.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:40.760
 That's a bold view. It's quite a bold view. So from the start off, the great master, just a couple

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:45.760
 days ago, Zogchen Sirimachay is giving a live teaching. And he said, someone asked him about

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:51.640
 Buddhism in India currently, how it's kind of a resurgence now. And he mentioned an interesting

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:59.040
 idea that was really helpful for my mind. And he talked about shallow swimming pool Buddhism,

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:07.560
 shallow swimming pool Buddhism. It's lovely if people get interested in Buddhism. Deliberative

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:14.080
 teachings of the Buddha Shakyamuni. But if the introduction is like going into the shallow end

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:26.160
 of a pool, we need that. It's safe, accessible, mindfulness. But it goes so deep. Buddhism goes

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:36.280
 so deep. Everything is the wisdom activity of Guru Bhajay. This is so deep. Everything is the

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:45.760
 Guru. Even on the Sutra level, everything's your mind. Chidamatra mind only is firmly established

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:52.240
 that in Sutra level, Bodhisattva Yana, everything you experience is your mind. Vajrayana assumes

00:07:52.240 --> 00:08:00.120
 that as a base. So this is deep end of the pool Buddhism. This is the vast expanse of Vajrayana.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:07.560
 So this is where we're playing. Okay, this is Guru Yoga. This is Vajrayana. I'm assuming that. Okay

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:07.680
,

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:12.520
 so that's where we get to play today. Because we're about to, we're practitioners, right? We're

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:12.760
 doing

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:18.120
 do some, do a Teresar Nundra practice. If we're not allowing our minds to entertain the possibility

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:23.800
 that everything is the wisdom mind of the teacher, I don't know what we're doing in Nundra. I mean,

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:30.600
 I'm not saying I can do that. But it's really clear. That's, that's like the ground of Nundra.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:42.240
 That's the view. So I'm just saying that's where we're opening. So as a, you know, setting the

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:51.520
 table properly. This is a deep end. So why Guru Yoga? Why surrender? But I was specifically talking

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:51.520
,

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:56.520
 I'm really the I'm assuming audiences more Vajrayana Tibetan Buddhist and practitioners,

00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:01.920
 people are really trying to transform their negative habits to reveal the wisdom within,

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:09.520
 to see the wisdom without. So that's the assumed audience here. So why Guru Yoga? Three Vajras,

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:15.240
 it's very practical. The idea of seeing three Vajras, all form, all sound, all space,

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:22.880
 everything we could possibly experience is perfectly pure, 100% perfect. That is a very

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:31.280
 big view is a very high view. So it's just practical. Instead of trying to swallow that

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:37.160
 view or open that wide, because we have to stay open that wide, it has to be stabilized. In the

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:43.360
 end, we have to get familiar with that kind of a view in Vajrayana. So a practical step before

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:54.120
 that is to see a single person as having pure body, pure speech, pure mind, just one. And what

00:09:54.120 --> 00:10:00.120
 do we look for? We look for a qualified teacher. And there's a lot of teachings on what a qualified

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:06.000
 teacher is. But this, and I'm not going to go over that now, maybe perhaps another time. But

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:13.040
 qualified teacher, then all of a sudden we say, okay, maybe I can't, I'm not ready to really like

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:18.360
 allow the kind of mega power that every single thing that happens to me, regardless of whether

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:25.840
 I like it or not is the guru is the Dharma. Maybe I'm not ready for that. So just what about one

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:33.160
 person? Everything they do is an expression of Dharma. Everything they say is the expression of

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:42.320
 Dharma. Everything I think about them is a way to connect to the Dharma. This is so practical. So

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:49.080
 this is one of the practical aspects of relating to a qualified teacher, someone who actually is

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:57.520
 motivated by bodhicitta. And they see the Buddha nature within beings, and they see it within you,

00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:03.880
 they see it within me. And their main aim is to help bring out that Buddha nature, to help it

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:10.840
 shine more brightly. And they don't enforce anything. We ask for their help. We ask them,

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:18.160
 please help me. I'm so lost. I have so much suffering. But I also have a little glimmer

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:23.120
 of confidence that this is not the end of the story. I'm not just some wandering, deluded,

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:30.200
 horrible being. I think there's a glimmer of goodness there. There's actually maybe this Buddha

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:36.840
 nature in me. And I can see it in you. So if we look for a check to see if someone's a qualified

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:42.120
 teacher, there's a lot of indications that someone's a qualified teacher. If someone really

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:46.880
 is shining out bodhicitta all the time, you'll see there's a lot of indications that their

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:52.280
 bodhicitta is on. Because in the end, the simple thing in the end, you're around them, people are

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:59.160
 around them. And people are more inspired towards the Dharma. People become more confident. People

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:10.520
 become more loving, more kind, more courageous, less games, less fickle in the wind. Rimechit says,

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:16.040
 not so sensitive. Oh, one day wind that way, one day wind this way. People become more kind

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:23.040
 of anchored, rooted. And that this is an effect of being in the presence of these great wisdom

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:27.400
 beings, these masters. There's a lot of outer indications of someone who's very stable in

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:34.240
 bodhicitta. And here we're talking about a Vajra master, like a Vajrayana teacher. And we ask, we

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:39.810
 look for them very carefully. And then when we kind of have confidence, and we've looked thoroughly

00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:40.000
,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.280
 and we're kind of developing trust, and we're checking them, then at a certain point in the

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:51.400
 Vajrayana view, we ask them, oh, will you be my teacher? Will you be my guru, my Vajrayana teacher?

00:12:51.400 --> 00:13:00.480
 We request it. And so they, you know, it's their bodhicitta. They're here to the endless end of

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:08.040
 time and space. All they're interested in doing is serving beings, serving the teachings. But if

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:13.280
 they accept us as a student, if we kind of fit the bill of a qualified student, there's a lot

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:20.240
 of teachings about that too. But so if that meets a qualified teacher and a qualified student, then

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:28.520
 we have this Vajrayana bond, a mutual commitment. Until all beings are enlightened, we are gonna

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:33.440
 stay around. And I'm gonna, as a student, I'm gonna rely on your help, your guidance, and I'm

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:40.390
 gonna try to follow it the best I can. And as a teacher, that person that Vajra master is promising

00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:40.400
,

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:46.680
 they'll stick it out too. Until I'm fully awake, until their student is fully awake, they will keep

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:54.470
 showing up for them. This is like a basic Vajrayana bond, connection between a teacher and student.

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:55.320
 So

00:13:55.320 --> 00:14:02.760
 this is such a sacred relationship. And it's just very practical. What are they helping us see? The

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:13.160
 outer inner secret ultimate, or the three Vajras, body, speech, mind, space, sound, form, it's all

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:20.280
 pure. It's all pure. All sentient beings have Buddha nature. And all the activities of sentient

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:29.480
 beings is just a mandala. So we say this one being, their Buddha, and all the activities around

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:29.680
 them,

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:35.240
 their retinue, their close ones, more distant ones, their students, their objects, their home,

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:41.680
 their activities, this is all just enlightened activity. And their mandala. This is a view we're

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:47.200
 trying to hold. And we do that critically with logic. And we do that more relaxedly with like a

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:53.440
 deeper logic, a more opened kind of post logic awareness, trying non conceptual wisdom, we're

00:14:53.440 --> 00:15:00.080
 trying to do both of these approaches. analytic analysis, also non conceptual wisdom. And we're

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:06.960
 trying to constantly see this and return on this vision called pure perception. This is Vajrayana

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:20.110
 view. This is all standard stuff, right? Standard radical stuff. Isn't it? Okay. So there's all

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:20.640
 kinds

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:26.880
 of textures in this conversation, because, okay, so we're asking, we're trying to see the guru as a

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:36.600
 pure as Buddha. And we'll get into this the definition a little more thoroughly. Their Buddha. And

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:36.640
 it's

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:42.160
 tricky. So I have like a sampling of tricky, interesting nuance textures with this topic,

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:48.400
 to like a little poke at a little bit and inquire and open up a little bit. So the first one is

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:56.320
 everything is pure body, speech and pure, pure body, pure speech, pure mind, everything. We don't

00:15:56.320 --> 00:16:00.640
 get to play preference games, we don't have to, we don't get to have favorites with which part

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:05.600
 of reality we're going to see as pure and which part we're not going to see as pure. In the end,

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:14.320
 the big view is, it's all pure, everything is pure. So we can't play the game is all the outside

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:22.320
 stuff. That's kind of fake. What's really real is in inside my mind. We can't play that game.

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:35.360
 Outside's pure, inside's pure. It's all pure. It's outer, inner, secret, ultimate. All of it is

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:39.840
 included, not just the part we like, or the part we're comfortable with, or the part we're most

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:45.600
 talented with. In the end, we have to include it all. Because this is about the nature of reality,

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:53.760
 of everything. So there's so many books. This is not just me talking about things. The Wish

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:58.160
 Fulfilling Jewel. This is Guru Yoga text by His Holiness Dhu of Kensei Rinpoche,

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:06.320
 in the long-changing tradition. Page eight. Guru Yoga, the union with the nature of the guru,

00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:10.880
 forms the foundation for all practices. There are many different techniques for its practice.

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:17.520
 Within Guru Yoga, there are outer, inner, secret, and most secret methods. The text at hand

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:18.080
 explains

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:23.280
 the outer method, which briefly is to visualize the guru dwelling above our head, and to pray to

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:29.280
 him ardently with fierce devotion. The inner method is to realize through the practice,

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:34.880
 that our own body, speech, and mind are inseparable from the wisdom body, speech, and mind of the

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:40.800
 guru. In the launch and ninctic cycle, the inner method is a Guru Rinpoche sadhana called Rigsan

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:47.600
 Dupa, or gathering of the awareness holders. The secret method is to meditate upon the guru in his

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:53.170
 Sambhogakaya form, the body of divine enjoyment, which in this cycle is the practice of Guru Rinp

00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:53.440
oche

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:58.640
 in the form of Chenrezig, and is called Dunya Rongral, or self-liberation of suffering.

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:03.760
 The most secret method introduces us to the natural state of awareness,

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:08.880
 and here involves the visualization of Kunchen Langchempa, with the primordial Buddha Samantabhadra

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:14.560
 in his heart. This most secret sadhana is called the Tiklejalchen, or the sealed quintessence.

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:19.760
 On the absolute level, the teacher is one with the very nature of our own mind,

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:25.440
 which is itself the essence of Buddhahood, the tatagatagarbha. What then is the method

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:30.960
 for realization of this absolute teacher? Through the outer, or relative, teacher and his pit

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:36.720
 instructions, we can bring ourselves to the realization of the inner, or absolute, teacher,

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:42.240
 which is awareness itself. The foundation, and thus the very basis for the accomplishment of

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:48.000
 this realization, is the present guru yoga, which belongs to the outer method, and is classified

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.840
 technically as a part of the preliminary practices. Since the actual heart of all the other stages

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:54.000
 and

00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:00.000
 practices is precisely this guru yoga, one would be quite mistaken to think of it as just a

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.200
 preliminary practice and, therefore, unimportant. Rather, we should realize that if we practice

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:05.360
 this

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:10.800
 guru yoga continuously throughout our entire life, then all the blessings of Guru Rinpoche himself

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:16.480
 will easily enter our being. Essentially, the practice is to remember the guru in all our

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:22.320
 activities, whether in meditation or in post-meditation periods. Thus, the actual sadhana

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:26.880
 does not require that we remain within the boundaries of a retreat, and it is appropriate

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:32.240
 for all occasions and circumstances, as well as for practitioners of all levels.

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:43.840
 So here, the point I'm just kind of emphasizing is, like skillfully, we use an outer guru, the

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:44.240
 outer

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:52.000
 guru yoga, to, in the end, realize ultimate guru, the absolute guru, which is the wisdom mind of

00:19:52.000 --> 00:20:00.800
 ourselves. And the wisdom guru, the inner mind of ourselves, includes the secret and the inner

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:07.760
 and the outer. It includes all of it. So it's not true to think the main thing is just the absolute

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:15.760
 Guru Rinpoche, my mind. The secondary, less important thing, is the outer guru.

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:22.080
 That's just, like, a means for me to recognize the real thing, because even in the middle way,

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:26.800
 Madhyamaka, they don't have preference between relative and absolute truth anymore.

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:33.840
 They're the same. Absolute is not more important than relative. Relative is not more important than

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:41.920
 absolute. They're not separate like that. This is in Sutra Mahayana. We can't denigrate the outer

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:48.880
 in favor of the inner. We can't forget the inner in favor of the outer. Full spectrum Buddhism.

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:54.560
 This is deep end of the pool Buddhism. We have to include all of it, not just the favorite part.

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:59.280
 If we don't like an outer part, we don't get to throw that away.

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:05.120
 If we don't like an inner part, we don't get to throw that away. We're talking about pure nature

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:11.600
 of everything. So that's a strong point for guru yoga, because if we just hold part of reality as

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:21.360
 pure and the rest is impure, this is not Vajrayana at all, and it won't work. So that's a strong

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:25.920
 point. And practically speaking, because I also really care about them making this try to be

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:32.160
 practical, when we're dying, this is also a zung sargasar Rinpoche said, "When we're dying,

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:39.360
 what's such an easy practice?" Guru yoga. Devotion.

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:45.280
 When things get really hard in life, really, really challenging,

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:54.880
 all the philosophical ideas and somersaults, they all stop. They become games. We get to see what

00:21:54.880 --> 00:22:00.640
 we've trained our mind in. How open is my heart now? When all of a sudden we can't control things.

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:08.160
 We can't move our body. We can't say anything who's in the room or not. We don't have any control

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:12.720
 over the outer environment. Even our own sense doors, they're failing. It's all getting kind of

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:23.200
 like disturbed and uncontrolled. Then at that point, devotion becomes a much easier avenue to

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:29.200
 recognize our wisdom mind through the avenue, like the skillful avenue of the outer teacher,

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:35.760
 of Guru Rinpoche, of Buddha, of our own personal lineage teacher. This is very practical.

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:43.120
 And this is like practical when we need help, when it's really challenging.

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:55.360
 In this way, Guru yoga is very, very practical. We can practice it at any time,

00:22:55.360 --> 00:23:00.560
 in any circumstance, for all levels of practice. In fact, in Venerable Kemper Rinpoche's book,

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:05.920
 The Nature of Mind, there's nine levels of zogchen practice. They go through each of the

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:10.400
 methods, each of the views and each of the methods related to those nine levels of zogchen practice

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:10.640
.

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:16.320
 The outermost level of zogchen practice is the Guru yoga that we do at the beginning of

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:24.480
 every single practice. That's the outermost practice for zogchen. Visualize Guru Rinpoche

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:30.000
 in the sky in front. Supplicate Guru Rinpoche. Receive the blessings of Guru Rinpoche. Mingle

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:37.200
 your mind with Guru Rinpoche completely. That's the outermost approach of zogchen. This is

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:41.120
 foundational. It's really foundational for zogchen, for these highest teachings,

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:46.400
 the great completion teachings, great perfection teachings. And we have to, just the point,

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:51.440
 it's very practical. And like actual mundane reality, when things aren't going our way,

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:58.830
 this is a much more practical thing we can actually connect to. Philosophically, it's so subtle. It

00:23:58.830 --> 00:23:58.880
's

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:05.520
 so thorough, this Guru yoga. And so we kind of open this a little bit more. What is this devotion?

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:13.200
 Have devotion when things are bad. When things are good, have devotion. What is this devotion?

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:18.720
 Because Buddhism's not theistic. We're not worshiping anything.

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:26.480
 I mean, it's just really, there's no Buddhism fundamentally saying there's not even a me here.

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:35.360
 There's no you there. What is a devotion in the non-theistic context?

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:39.920
 Kim Po-seung, Don Yung Rinpoche always mentions it, and he always demonstrates it so lovely.

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:47.200
 A close, warm-hearted connection to the Dharma, to the lineage, to beings.

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:53.600
 Like this deep, like Ninjae, this compassion for being so juicy. It's so tender.

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:59.870
 We know we've been, those who've had the fortune to be around great masters like Kim Po-seung Rinp

00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:00.240
oche,

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:08.080
 Ken Chipotle and Cher Rinpoche, they're so, it's just so rich. Their kindness is so rich. It's like

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:18.000
 squishy. It's so like ripe, you know, so kind, so just beautiful. They're so mingled with Dharma.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:24.800
 Close, warm-hearted connection to the Dharma. They have such a close reverence for the teacher,

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:29.520
 like Kim Po-seung Rinpoche. His teacher is Holiness Duch Rinpoche, so close. He had many

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:34.240
 teachers, but his Holiness Duch Rinpoche, he wrote his biography, Fearless Light of Indestructible

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:38.480
 Wisdom. You read that biography, it's such a perfect example of what it means to be a qualified

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:46.720
 student, how he wrote that book, how he saw his teacher. It's just so juicy. It has juice,

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:53.840
 so alive, this warm-hearted connection. You feel like you're a part of it. The devotion,

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:58.400
 it makes it sizzle, like Rinpoche says so much. It's like sizzling. The Dharma is like so ripe,

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:03.600
 it's so happening. I'm a part of this, this lineage thing. It's not some gone,

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:09.440
 ancient museum piece. This is it. We're in it now. This is living lineage. We're all going to be a

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:16.800
 part of living lineage right now. Then how do we maintain this sizzling connection? The sense of

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:21.990
 like, wow, I have this responsibility, this living lineage. I have this opportunity to become

00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:22.400
 enlightened

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:30.320
 with this life, this very life. I could get out of cyclo samsara and actually be of tremendous

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:38.080
 benefit for beings forever. This life, it could happen. For all the future generations, what I'm

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:44.240
 doing now, what we're doing now with the Buddha Dharma, I don't want to mess this up. I don't want

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:52.560
 to break anything. This system's worked for thousands of years. Countless beings have achieved

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:57.520
 enlightenment from this system. What's the heart of this system? Guru yoga.

00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:06.800
 This is such a special opportunity we have to connect with the wisdom mind of a teacher.

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:15.920
 Why? To connect with our own wisdom mind. See the wisdom minds of all beings. To have a real sacred

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:22.400
 outlook of ourselves and others. We're a part of this living lineage. This is devotion.

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:32.720
 Devotion is not you're good and I'm bad. You have power and I need help getting a new car.

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:39.040
 Devotion is like this living, we're all in interdependence, all these connections with

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:44.640
 each other. Close ones, near ones, middle ones, far ones, really far connections, but we're all

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:50.160
 connected, interdependence. Devotion is really feeling a part of the field of connection

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:58.800
 and lining ourselves up, attuning, aligning with more connection in a way that's going to be more

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:05.760
 mutually boosting or anything I say, anything I think, anything I do, it's going to be

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:13.920
 more supportive, like more nutrition. That ripple of energy, of cause, condition is going to merge

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:20.000
 out and be more supportive, like nutrition or beneficial boosting supports for other beings

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:29.360
 that come across that, that mind wave I created, that word I generated, that kind of movement,

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:32.880
 these great masters, you can see they become so elegant.

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:40.320
 They're so attuned, they're so aligning with the situations, the circumstances,

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:46.880
 and we're asking them in Guru Yoga, like line up with me so that I realize my wisdom more quickly,

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:52.720
 so that my compassion turns on more brightly, and all the things blocking it, just remove that,

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:58.000
 help me remove that, show me how to remove that for myself. I can get myself out of the mud.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:04.480
 I can see that it's just a wisdom, it's just Guru Rinpoche happening all the time.

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:11.280
 This is all mind, mind is emptiness, everything is mind, it's all pure, these are all big ideas.

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:17.520
 We're asking with this connection in Guru Yoga to help us actually get really familiar with this,

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:22.240
 we may get so intimate with these ideas that they become like our default mode,

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:29.920
 they become just the water we're in. This is all Guru Rinpoche happening, three vajras,

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:38.720
 pure perception, and the trick is with all this, is that there's some truths we don't want to see,

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:42.000
 we just don't.

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:49.760
 We can say everything's pure, but when we really open up everything,

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:52.640
 there's a lot of everything we don't want to look at,

00:29:52.640 --> 00:30:02.160
 just for different reasons, but since we're like kind of in playing the space of Guru Yoga,

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:06.480
 I opened this book, it's now becoming an old book,

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:15.760
 the Vajrayana Seminary teachings of Vajradhara Shoryam Trumpermache,

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:24.320
 Tantric Path of Indestructible Wakefulness, this book is amazing, this book is amazing.

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:36.800
 Okay, here's where we go, Guru Yoga now, some truths we don't want to see, page 95,

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:46.640
 anyone entering into the Vajrayana needs such a Vajramaster, it is said that you need a Vajramaster

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:53.760
 who's like a crocodile, who only knows how to accept, once anybody enters into the crocodile's

00:30:53.760 --> 00:31:00.720
 mouth, it accepts rather than rejects, the crocodile never lets go, rejection is against

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:06.800
 the principle of crocodile ship, and that quality of not letting go is also one of the Vajra

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:13.120
 principles of the Vajramaster, you actually find that image in the iconography of the

00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:22.320
 Buddhist iconography, the five pointed Vajra scepter or the Dorje, the four outer prongs of

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:32.320
 the Vajra arise out of the mouth of four crocodiles, the principle of Vajrayana is non-flinching,

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:44.320
 you never let go, but you accept and hold on, that is Vajra nature, and the same thing applies to

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:49.040
 the Vajramaster who's actually and literally the spokesperson of the Vajrayana teachings,

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:55.200
 in fact the Vajramaster is the only spokesperson, even the books that present the Vajrayana

00:31:55.200 --> 00:32:01.120
 teachings cannot be regarded as independent from the Vajramaster, books can speak in some sense,

00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:05.920
 but books have to be worked with, interpreted and elucidated to be suitable for you,

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:11.520
 I'm going to keep reading this because this is really important, the Vajramaster has two

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:17.200
 expressions relative and ultimate, the relative expression is how the Vajramaster manifests

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:23.520
 something according to Kunzop or the relative phenomenal world, sometimes Kunzop can fool you

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:28.320
 a great deal and sometimes it can inspire you to see the flawlessness of the truth,

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:34.080
 in order to deal with your apparent phenomenal world, to deal with your fascination of this

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:41.520
 world of facade, you have an external guru, a Kunzop guru, this external guru or Vajramaster

00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:47.680
 of Kunzop actually exists outside of your body and mind, this guru is manifested externally,

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:54.320
 the Kunzop guru shares the same roof, the same sky, the same floor and the same earth as you do,

00:32:55.760 --> 00:33:02.640
 the second type of guru, the ultimate guru or tundam appears from the memory or the example

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:08.480
 of the external guru, from that you begin to have a sense of inner guru or inner guidance,

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:14.960
 this is often subject to misunderstanding because the inner guru could be misinterpreted as a part

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:21.680
 of your expectations, if you do not have a complete and proper relationship with a Kunzop guru,

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:26.960
 you could misunderstand the inner guru according to your own wishful thinking,

00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:33.120
 I repeat that last line, if you do not have a complete and proper relationship with a Kunzop

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:39.440
 guru, an outer guru, you could misunderstand the inner guru according to your own wishful thinking,

00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:47.040
 the guru of Kunzop is also called the guru of example or impression, when you have enough

00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:52.160
 impression of, sorry, when you have enough of an impression of the Kunzop guru imprinted on your

00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:58.970
 state of mind, then the guru of the ultimate reality within you can shine through, otherwise the

00:33:58.970 --> 00:33:59.280
 inner

00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:05.440
 guru could be regarded as just pure hoax, just your own expectations, that kind of inner guru

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:11.680
 is much phonier than the real Kunzop guru who actually exists outside of your body physically

00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:18.560
 or geographically, continuing just a little bit longer, the way in which the Kunzop guru becomes

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:22.880
 imprinted on your state of mind comes from something more than simply observing the guru

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:28.400
 or just gazing at the guru, admiring him or her and hoping for the best somehow does not work,

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:34.720
 the impression the guru makes on you is a question of how much communication takes place between

00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:34.880
 the

00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:42.800
 guru and you, it is a question of how much the actual message is getting into you, if we return

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:47.920
 to the analogy of the guru being like a crocodile you could say that the impression of the teacher

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:53.600
 that makes on you is the same as when the crocodile has swallowed you, digested you and

00:34:53.600 --> 00:35:00.720
 shat you out and afterward you still have teeth marks on your neck, as another analogy it is a

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:06.480
 bit like relating to your dying father by having to put him in the coffin and put flowers around

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:12.560
 his corpse rather than just watching the ceremony, you take part in the funeral service for your

00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:12.800
 dead

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:20.640
 father and it makes an impression on you, you have a sense of reality, in talking about the Kunzop

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:26.210
 guru we're talking about a living guru, the guru is sending particular messages to you and manifest

00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:26.240
ing

00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:31.920
 their liveliness to you in all kinds of ways, the living power of the lineage is taking place

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:37.490
 channeled through your guru, some of the guru's messages may be verbal while others are

00:35:37.490 --> 00:35:37.760
 communicated

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:44.000
 in silence, it could be any form of communication but it has to be realistic rather than imaginary,

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.800
 you cannot stretch the logic by thinking that since your guru gave you an apple this morning

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:53.600
 you've attained some kind of fruition, the guru might give you an egg but that does not mean

00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:59.440
 you're in an embryonic state, the communication is more sophisticated than that, the guru is aware

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:04.480
 of your intelligence and any communication has to work within that individual intelligence.

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:14.240
 So we have to really actually be vulnerable

00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:24.080
 when it says mingling with the wisdom mind of the teacher in guru yoga this is not at a distance,

00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:30.720
 this has to be like felt and we have to be moved, we have to be moved by this connection,

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:35.680
 we have to let it shape us, we have to be exposed,

00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:46.240
 we have to be exposed, there's truth we need to see, if we don't see certain truths

00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:52.000
 we'll never deal with them, there'll be parts of reality we just don't go, we just like leave in

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:58.240
 the corner, I'm not saying we need to see all the truth at once because then most of us will just

00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:06.080
 explode, I would explode definitely but little by little we have to we have to become more

00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:12.880
 receptive, more vulnerable to actually having the dharma mingle with us to change ourselves

00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:24.720
 and I'm just saying what is the wisdom mind the wisdom mind of a guru is not my idea of it.

00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:31.680
 I can't possibly know the wisdom mind of a guru, I don't have wisdom mind like that,

00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:36.960
 I don't know what it's like to be an omniscient or beyond the boomies,

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:44.640
 it's way it's beyond my current blind spots, so I'm relying on someone who's not doesn't

00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:51.800
 have those blind spots who sees a way around that corner and they're helping me see what I don't

00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:51.840
 see

00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:57.920
 yet, they're pointing out something I can't see that's there right in front of me, it's like a

00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:02.800
 piece of your nose when you close one eye there's always a piece of your nose there, you close

00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:08.880
 another eye there's a piece of your nose, there's always you're always looking at your nose and in

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:15.280
 your view but it we blend it out our mind just overlooks it every single moment like I don't see

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:21.440
 my nose but it's actually you close one eye there's a piece of your nose there we constantly like

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:21.680
 not

00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:27.120
 seeing these things that are right in front of us literally we need someone to help point that out

00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:33.520
 to us who we can trust and rely on so this is a big topic so quite a big topic and I thought to

00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:40.680
 open up certain things because it's also the heart essence of Adriana and we're doing it all the

00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:40.880
 time

00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:47.360
 this is the this is the the practice of zogchen but if we do it in a way we have to let it make

00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:55.280
 us tender you have to let us make make us kind of juicy and cozy and that can be very raw like very

00:38:55.280 --> 00:39:03.040
 uncontrolled very exposed when we see the parts of ourselves and the world we don't want to see yet

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:07.760
 and then we need supportive circumstances to actually be able to see these things too

00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:13.280
 we're not kind of being silly and just like showing ourselves the blatant truth we're not

00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:19.120
 taking some giant heroic dose of mushrooms and just show me reality you know because for the

00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:24.320
 most part that happens and a lot of people don't come back together they get ripped open

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:29.360
 then they have to do physical therapy mental therapy the whole rest of their life to

00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:34.880
 at that this is too much too fast too soon we're trying to be a little more delicate and a little

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:43.040
 more kind of masterful than that it's not Adriana and bodhisattva yana hero hero heroine ship

00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:48.880
 it's not one time in a battle we're not like i'm a hero if i go in the battlefield and do it once

00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:54.320
 this is i have to keep showing up every single moment for all beings that's the kind of hero

00:39:54.320 --> 00:40:00.320
 her here warriorship talked about in the bodhisattva yana every moment i'm at serving beings

00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:09.840
 forever this is such a courageous view vadriana view just makes this more approachable honestly

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:14.160
 because it doesn't say there's these impure stuff that we need to remove

00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:18.560
 it says look at that stuff a little more closely it's actually wisdom

00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:25.120
 look at the emotions a little more closely their source is actually wisdom before we twist it

00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:33.280
 it's actually wisdom this is such a heroic view to not throw anything out how non-violent this

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:41.920
 is such a non-violent view there's no garbage to remove there's nothing to fix there's nothing i

00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:49.600
 have to judge and fix someone else's thing either it's all pure this is a very very bold view

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:54.960
 but we need the support of circumstances for this view which is an immense view

00:40:54.960 --> 00:41:02.240
 and it really is destabilizing and dismantling this view because in the end i want to this

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:07.840
 quotes good devotion that closeness that warm heartedness this is not any way a sense of servitude

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:14.720
 it's not some small view of right and wrong up and down good and bad your special i'm not

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:20.800
 this is the guru drinks bourbon looks like cancer image page

00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:29.440
 194 it may sound as if you have devotion first in order to have an understanding of the view

00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:35.200
 the devotion ignites the practice of the dharma but as you become more seasoned in practicing

00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:41.280
 the dharma especially the vadriana the gap between devotion and the goal of the devotion

00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:47.600
 becomes very small as you become more skilled in practicing you'll see that devotion is the

00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:53.920
 awareness of impermanence devotion is the renunciation mind devotion is compassion for

00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:59.760
 all beings devotion is none other than the experience of dependent arising most important

00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:05.040
 the moment there's devotion you have the view and there is the awareness of shunyatta

00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:13.280
 the great master took origin which he said the two principal points of vadriana are devotion

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:19.760
 and compassion we have devotion to those above the awakened beings who are further much further

00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:25.120
 along than ourselves in compassion for ourselves and all beings like us and those suffering even

00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:31.280
 more these two devotion and compassion great jot something posted the same thing with these

00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:41.280
 two all the practices stay on track devotion and compassion there's these simple things we can do

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:48.090
 to keep coming back as a simple practice devotion guryoga is so simple it's so elegant is not

00:42:48.090 --> 00:42:48.560
 really

00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:55.760
 there's it's very simple as like what we need to do in the practice is quite simple and it's

00:42:55.760 --> 00:43:01.040
 actually very practiceable in all the circumstances but we really do need to like ready ourselves

00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:01.200
 for

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:10.240
 the immensity of seeing everything is pure so i'm kind of out of time but there's books like karma

00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:17.120
 chagme great master kedav karma chagme there's raga asai he said in his quintessence union

00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:25.760
 absorption and mahamudra is song seven there's four enhancements to any practice the first one

00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:33.840
 is guryoga second one is yidam practice the third one is tung lien and the fourth one is tricha and

00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:42.720
 togol but the first is guryoga when the practice is getting stale guryoga if you're interested in

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:49.520
 learning more song seven union of mahamudra and zogchen again his only is duga kensa nirmuche

00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:57.120
 a hundred verses of advice it's teachings on the great master parampasanjay verse 98 sometimes you

00:43:57.120 --> 00:44:02.320
 may get discouraged your practice is not working and you worry that it will never become stable

00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:07.920
 nothing seems right and you ask yourself whether you might not make the swifter progress by

00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:08.320
 changing

00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:14.720
 to another practice during these moments of doubt and hesitation if a deep and yearning devotion

00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:14.880
 for

00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:19.760
 your teacher wells up from the depths of your heart the obstacles that are impending you will

00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:25.760
 dissolve and your practice will be invigorated unshakable faith and devotion act like a magnifying

00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:32.080
 glass that can concentrate the rays of the sun and easily kindle a heap of dried grass into a flame

00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:38.160
 real progress on the path comes from the blessings of the guru and these blessings are sparked by

00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:43.040
 your devotion most of the great teachers of the past attain realization through devotion to their

00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:48.800
 own gurus for example so great was the devotion of some of gumpopas disciples that they realized

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:54.000
 the nature of mind simply by laying eyes on dagla gumpo mountain where he lived

00:44:54.000 --> 00:45:03.280
 just repeating these things this is devotion is the heart of this it's the way that most masters

00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:09.600
 in the lineage achieved accomplishment is devotion so we can't take this lightly

00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:14.480
 we really have to kind of open and look at this and then they say this

00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:18.240
 this is such an amazing book guide to the words of my perfect teacher

00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:25.360
 by kempo naong paozong then he was said to be emanation of vimalamitra the great master of

00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:31.200
 vimalamitra this is such a beautiful book it goes through words of my perfect teacher the the from

00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:43.280
 the ati yoga view yeah so this is in the sangha house this is now getting older 2004 so in the

00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:49.760
 ati yoga section of guru yoga it's talking about how we see our teacher in order so this is the

00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:56.400
 key thing in order for guru yoga to actually be a complete path how do we have to see our teacher

00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:04.800
 so this book goes into this quite a lot so quote 258

00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:12.080
 what is the most important thing here it is to pray to the teacher with such devotion that we

00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:17.360
 see him as a buddha if we do so the wisdom of realization will take birth in our minds

00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:23.200
 quote within six months of unwavering devotion you will reach the level of vajradhara

00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:30.080
 also quote through devotion to the teacher even the graded levels and paths are accomplished

00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:39.360
 within months or years so we must see the teacher as buddha how in the pratimosa tradition whether

00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:44.000
 or not the teacher is a sublime shravaka or pratyaka buddha it is sufficient to see him as

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:49.760
 an ordinary person with good qualities in the bodhisattva tradition it is enough to see the

00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:55.200
 teacher as someone with bodhisattva qualities whether he is on one of the sublime bodhisattva

00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:59.920
 levels or a nirvana kaya buddha or simply someone on the greater path of accumulating

00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:06.720
 in the tradition of the great perfection seeing one's teacher as an ordinary pandit a sublime

00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:13.280
 arhat a sublime bodhisattva a nirvana kaya buddha or even a sambhoga kaya buddha will not do

00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:20.560
 you have to see him as the dharmakaya buddha if you're able to do so and pray to him thus

00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:25.760
 with unwavering devotion the wisdom of realization can arise in you in your mind

00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:32.320
 without your having to rely on any other factor as a path this manner of realization has been

00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:39.200
 borne out in many cases in the noble land of india those of naropa nagabodhi and master gandapa

00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:44.800
 and in tibet those of sampo lapel the great omniscient langchampa the vijadara jingme lingpa

00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:52.480
 and others in order to see the teacher as buddha there are five things you should know one that he

00:47:52.480 --> 00:48:00.160
 is a buddha two that everything he does is the activity of a buddha three that for us he's even

00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:06.480
 kinder than all of the buddhas four that his immensely kind that that this immensely kind

00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:12.800
 teacher is the embodiment of all the refuges and five that if you pray to him with all of this in

00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:18.240
 mind the wisdom of realization will take birth in your being without your having to depend on

00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:25.600
 any other factors as a path and then the next several pages go over these five ways that we

00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:34.000
 need to know about our teacher being a dharmakaya buddha so this is like standard zogchen like for

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:41.280
 guriyoga to work in zogchen we have to see the teacher as a dharmakaya buddha so that is the

00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:48.800
 statement made by ken kenpo naum pelsang so this is all in patra rambhache's words of my perfect

00:48:48.800 --> 00:49:00.240
 teacher he's just unpacking more subtle layers of the meaning so yeah then there's a lot of ways to

00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:03.760
 like make this like really light too and then i'll wrap up

00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:10.400
 this in the presence of masters this is a compilation of quotes of buddhist masters

00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:15.600
 from the three yanas foundation of buddhism mahayana bhajriyana and it goes all just

00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:23.040
 quotations from different masters and so i looked in there and there's different one of the

00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:23.760
 quotations

00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:33.200
 by his son's duo kensarimbejai again page 172 on metaphors of the guru the teacher is like a great

00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:39.280
 ship carrying us on the perilous ocean of existence an unerring navigator guiding us to the dry

00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:39.520
 land

00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:45.440
 of liberation a rain of nectar extinguishing the inferno of negative emotions and actions

00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:52.880
 a bright sun and moon dispelling the darkness of ignorance a firm earth patiently bearing the

00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:53.280
 weight

00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:59.360
 of both good and bad a wish granting tree bestowing both present and ultimate happiness

00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:06.160
 a treasury of vast and deep instructions a wish granting gem providing whatever beings need on

00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:13.120
 their path a father and mother loving all beings equally a great river of wide and swift compassion

00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:18.560
 a great mountain of joy rising above worldly concerns and unshaken by the winds of emotion

00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:25.440
 a great rain cloud raining down its benefits impartially everywhere uninfluenced by like or

00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:34.000
 dislike so how to see the teacher so there's just like okay so if we're supposed to see the teacher

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:38.960
 as dharmakaya buddha then how like how do we warm up to that and then that's on us for study and

00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:45.120
 practice i mean really there's a lot of teachings and a lot of sangha we can kind of warm up but to

00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:50.720
 like get that sizzling devoted kind of juicy connection is the responsibility of practitioners

00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:56.640
 vadriana practitioners i'm talking about to have this be a fresh kind of living experience

00:50:56.640 --> 00:51:01.120
 this is kind of what we're trying to do but then in the end it becomes so simple

00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:07.440
 like matchy rickard and big end of his big memoir he's saying about his own path

00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:17.200
 345 notebooks of wondering month

00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:22.160
 he's talking about a retreat he was in more than any other form of practice

00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:26.400
 i engaged in guru yoga a union with the teacher's nature of ultimate enlightenment

00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:29.760
 a practice that has always been at the heart of my spiritual path

00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:35.440
 the union of your own mind with the teachers allows you to rediscover the primordial simplicity

00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:41.760
 of the nature of your mind in which you need only rest without hope and fear because he ends up

00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:48.240
 being so simple the union of your own mind with the teacher allows you to rediscover the primordial

00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:53.920
 simplicity of the nature of mind in which you need only rest without hope and fear

00:51:53.920 --> 00:52:02.720
 there's nothing to accomplish it's already done it's already pure then what a relief that's such

00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:09.840
 a big relief actually in the end this view but then we have to get kind of so cozy and familiar

00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:15.410
 with it that when all the kind of turbulence comes up this becomes a reliable way that we can

00:52:15.410 --> 00:52:15.760
 engage

00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:21.040
 with experience with life with ourselves with others and this is the path this is like badriana

00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:28.560
 path and we happen to already be in the crocodile mouths of teacher if we happen to have taken like

00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:34.560
 act you know asked requested teacher to be our vajra vajra master and padriana teacher

00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:40.880
 if we were to take empowerments then we're in this which is a big benefit it's like tremendous

00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:47.120
 benefit and at the same time there's all kinds of caveats

00:52:52.400 --> 00:53:00.240
 one this is by subni rubiche in the same presence of masters 182 of course we need to follow a

00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:04.720
 spiritual teacher and of course we need to receive instructions of course we need to put those

00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:09.920
 instructions into practice but if one spends one's whole life trying to follow spiritual teachers

00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:17.070
 something is also wrong there we need to supplicate our root guru in order to discover the indiv

00:53:17.070 --> 00:53:17.120
isible

00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:24.610
 nature of his mind and our mind that is definitely necessary but it's not good to think quote if I

00:53:24.610 --> 00:53:24.720
'm

00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:29.680
 not with my teacher I won't know how to practice if I'm not with my teacher I can't deal with

00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:37.360
 disturbing emotions if I'm not with my teacher I'm lost and I don't know what to do so this is

00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:44.800
 theistic buddhism we use the teacher to make an impression and then we have that impression that

00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:49.600
 memory there's habits there's good habits that kind of impression the guidance we've received

00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:54.400
 and we're trying to apply it in our life and rely on it but it doesn't mean we always have to be

00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:59.600
 right next to them we don't have to call and ask what color to paint the bathroom or something you

00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:07.040
 know I mean it's it's good if we really need the support sometimes that is the support we're in a

00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:12.240
 spot where like we're just like basically really fragile condition and that's the kind of support

00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:19.440
 we need but this is a dharmakaya buddha we're asking about pink or green

00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:27.600
 you know in the end the path is liberation of all beings not just worldly concerns

00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:31.840
 last thing

00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:41.920
 this is such a good quote from trunk vermice tantric path of indestructible wakefulness

00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:44.960
 108

00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:54.160
 great along with this understanding of sacred outlook it's very important for you to understand

00:54:54.160 --> 00:55:01.600
 that the world has three aspects the yidam's or principal deities the teacher or vajra master

00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:08.160
 and yourself combined that three-fold situation provides what is known as the vajra world

00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:16.720
 sacred outlook is not only about thinking that everything is good it is the absence of imprisonment

00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:23.840
 sacred outlook is not only about thinking that everything is good it is the absence of

00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:31.120
 imprisonment you begin to experience freedom that is intrinsically good almost unconditionally

00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:37.760
 free so the vajra world that you're entering is basically good unconditionally free fundamentally

00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:39.440
 glorious and splendid

00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:49.200
 that's called freedom it's all pure it's all vermice

00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:55.760
 so then this goes into okay two more things and then i'm actually will go into practice

00:55:55.760 --> 00:55:57.760
 this book is really amazing

00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:08.160
 okay i know ziger contra mache he really references i have some habit memory in my

00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:13.680
 mind of him saying this word so much this is on complete openness this is about how to relate to

00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:22.960
 the teacher okay surrender mingling with the wisdom mind of the teacher 113 having developed

00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:29.920
 devotion the next level is what is called is lotte lincure in tibetan lo lo te means trust

00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:34.320
 it refers to having a kind of trust that is a mixture of faith and devotion

00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:42.400
 and to having a firm commitment ling means completely and cure means abandoning or letting

00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:51.040
 go so lo te lincure means to trust completely and be willing to let go in other words once you

00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:57.200
 develop trust in the teacher and the teachings you do not check your insurance policy you may or

00:56:57.200 --> 00:56:57.440
 may

00:56:57.440 --> 00:57:04.560
 not have an insurance policy but in any case you let go of that with lo te lincure you're actually

00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:10.560
 trying to put your hand through your rib cage in order to take out your heart and hand it over to

00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:16.960
 your guru you hope that your guru will take care of your heart both for yourself and for your guru

00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:24.130
 and having taken out your heart you still survive beautifully it is an extremely personal

00:57:24.130 --> 00:57:24.640
 experience

00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:32.720
 surrendering to the guru is not necessarily confirmed by the teacher alone you also begin

00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:40.510
 to realize your own existence your own space your own situation by surrendering you become worthy

00:57:40.510 --> 00:57:40.720
 of

00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:48.000
 receiving further knowledge it is a pragmatic approach not particularly philosophical it is

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:59.200
 an idea that comes through practice and then finally next after this openness or trust and

00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:08.960
 a willingness to like really let go of old habits goes into daringness 114

00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:14.880
 there's several factors that enable you to bring the teacher into your life

00:58:15.920 --> 00:58:20.480
 along with these factors such as faith and devotion you also need daringness

00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:28.320
 daringness is more tricky it is letting go of your own personal collection the things that you have

00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:35.600
 been holding on to for a long time you've built a stronghold within yourself a sand castle which

00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:42.000
 guards a sand castle with guards and weapons and communication systems so that nothing can ever

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:48.320
 jeopardize your project of holding on to the survival of your ego so you might begin to panic

00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:55.520
 about whether you're willing to give in give up or more likely give out letting go of that whole

00:58:55.520 --> 00:59:02.160
 system is very daring even threatening in some cases but without making such a daring move to

00:59:02.160 --> 00:59:08.800
 accomplish egolessness any achievement of enlightenment is impossible that is actually

00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:15.520
 the definition of liberation being liberated from yourself it means that you're liberated

00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:21.440
 from arrogance panic and deep-rooted attachment so basically what we're talking about here is

00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:27.600
 that you have to tear open your heart you do not literally need to commit suppuku but

00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:28.560
 psychologically

00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:36.160
 is very close to that the possibility is there having given up having surrendered totally

00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:42.800
 thoroughly and properly you find yourself in a delightful situation what a relief

00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:52.240
 i got away from myself i managed to abandon myself in the process you might sweat you might

00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:58.880
 shake you might shudder stutter but it is a good stutter a good shake a good panic because you've

00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:06.000
 been released from that particular imprisonment you find yourself so meek you begin to feel

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:10.320
 very humble therefore you can actually relate with the vajra master

01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:21.120
 at that point you begin to find there's no barrier between you and the teacher

01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:29.680
 you feel that finally your windows and doors have been opened so that at last you can experience

01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:37.360
 fresh air which is so refreshing so natural and so good you feel quite humble but at the same time

01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:43.920
 you feel so delighted at last you can smile without pretense and you can see your world

01:00:43.920 --> 01:01:07.440
 in a different light such possibilities always exist so this is the type of surrender being

01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:15.120
 pointed to in vatriana context to actually mingle with the wisdom mind of the teacher and we happen

01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:21.850
 to be we meaning students of venerable kenbermages we happen to be so fortunate and like how

01:01:21.850 --> 01:01:22.240
 amazing

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:33.360
 they are by all accounts any way you look they're so extraordinary we are so fortunate and this so

01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:39.680
 this is like all these things are challenging to become so vulnerable and to do so gracefully

01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:46.880
 carefully kindly intelligently consciously not recklessly but to really delicately with a lot

01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:54.320
 of good intention bodhicitta to like actually like make this commitment to reveal my egoic

01:01:54.320 --> 01:02:00.000
 shortcomings so they can i can really blend and mingle with the wisdom mind of the teacher

01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:10.480
 dharmakaya buddha union of three kyas so i'm like we're so fortunate and there's great masters in

01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:17.680
 the world and this is a living lineage that we can fully rely on to achieve enlightenment

01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:25.760
 in such a short period of time for the benefit of all beings this is very possible there's been so

01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:32.230
 many masters in the lineage who've done it and now we get to try we're trying this is the years go

01:02:32.230 --> 01:02:32.480
 by

01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:37.760
 there's only like sands through the hourglass those are the days of our lives

01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:47.920
 this is going so like every moment counts this all matters in this vatriana view the power is like

01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:55.840
 these giant giant arctic shelves of egoic imprisonment we've frozen ourselves into for

01:02:55.840 --> 01:03:04.400
 so long we can just break off these huge cliffs of being stuck self-fixated in really short time

01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:11.520
 but it's going to shake us it will rattle us being that exposed that willing to be changed

01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:19.120
 is a very strong experience and that's the deep end of the pool buddhism this is vajrayana buddhism

01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:25.040
 i don't see any personally i don't see much benefit to giving the dharma light version

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:31.520
 of tibetan buddhism vajrayana has been in the so-called west or like united states of america

01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:38.240
 now for quite some decades look at this stack of books this is all like in the last 10 years

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:42.880
 there's thousands of them now there's so many teachers there's so many teachings that you can

01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:47.760
 i bet right this minute you can click a button on your computer and do five zoom calls of actual

01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:53.680
 teachers that are reliable and practice with them watch their videos it's so accessible

01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:57.680
 this is like kind of enough in one way enough kind of fooling around

01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:06.640
 it's up to each of us this guru yoga is so accessible it's so easy it brings all the

01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:12.880
 practices into one it's going to be very challenging but it can't get more simple than this

01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:16.000
 you can't make zogchen more simple than this

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:24.240
 if you try to take out guru yoga from zogchen there's no zogchen if you try to take out an

01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:28.560
 actual living connection to an actual living teacher who's going to show the inner guru too

01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:31.600
 you say oh i don't need the outer guru because i have an inner guru

01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:39.840
 no one in vashriyana history has ever done that never happened why because they say it doesn't work

01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:46.560
 so it's a free country we're all welcome to do whatever we want because samsara us

01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:53.440
 can do it any way we want but we happen to have like authentic living lineage with completely

01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:59.200
 reliable vashriyana masters and like living all these teachings and practices so here we go

01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:05.600
 with dojum tersar nundra his holiness dojum rimpoche supreme head of ningma school like we're

01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:12.560
 right in the middle of so much rich vashriyana treasure so then we'll go to this dojum tersar

01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:18.000
 nundra practice connecting with wisdom mind of his holiness of our own personal teachers and

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:23.840
 our own wisdom mind and really mingling them together thanks so much your kindness patience

01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:30.480
 thank you and then we'll go to dojum tersar nundra page 18 calling the lama from afar

01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:46.640
 thank you thank you all thank you a few concluding words brief

01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:55.040
 so this all comes down to bodhicitta and we're really honest with ourselves and we get it for

01:05:55.040 --> 01:06:00.720
 the great masters who've really studied this studied dharma great scholars great practitioners

01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:08.720
 they've come to see because they say it's all comes down to bodhicitta this is all about bodhicitta

01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:18.800
 the whole path all the different aspects of the path foundation of buddhism mahayana vashriyana

01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:26.000
 all bodhicitta heart mind of enlightenment and if we're honest with ourselves and when we

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:33.440
 dare to look closely at our own minds i can see for myself i'm really not doing much with

01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:43.440
 bodhicitta most of the time just have to look and see that and change that's the path so in the

01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:53.360
 context of vashriyana then what does this mean and there's a quote from trunk vermice and i found

01:06:53.360 --> 01:07:05.520
 this very helpful because it's so true 101 the guru is the maker of all kinds of situations

01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:13.440
 in order to further a student's relationship with the dharma bodhicitta in order to further a

01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:19.280
 student's relationship with the dharma the guru creates situations and inspiration from a mundane

01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:25.040
 way of looking at this it is quite futile and needless to create such unnecessary hassles

01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:31.280
 but the guru does not hesitate to do so even though these hassles are seemingly bizarre

01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:38.400
 or unnecessary and interestingly those situations bring enormous insight to the student's mind

01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:44.880
 when we speak of the guru setting up a situation for the student it is not so much an actual

01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:52.000
 biological or physiological setup it is more of a psychological world that is the guru creates a

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:59.440
 psychological situation in which you're paranoid or highly inspired or whatever it may be this has

01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:04.320
 nothing to do with your basic karma if you're born with a lot of bad karma for example the guru's

01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:10.000
 role is to include that in the situation and within that they then create further situations

01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:17.840
 which are basically psychological so the guru's actions are a kind of play the guru helps you to

01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:23.920
 see things clearly but before you can see things clearly you might need to experience some kind of

01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:31.600
 confusion you might need some things to be turned upside down to begin with and then you might turn

01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:38.000
 things right side up properly through the situations created by the guru you're able to see this

01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:44.080
 that seemed important to say

01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:53.440
 and then another thing that seemed important to say is how all these things come to this again

01:08:53.440 --> 01:09:00.560
 is his holiness "dugo kentze vermice" is a very popular like very widely spread quote now of his

01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:08.880
 holiness heart advice in four lines as long as "dugo kentze vermice" do not forget the lama

01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:19.440
 pray to him at all times do not let mind be distracted watch your mind essence do not forget

01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:27.840
 death persist in dharma do not forget sentient beings with compassion dedicate your merit to them

01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:36.560
 say it one more time do not forget the lama pray to him at all times do not let mind be distracted

01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:43.520
 watch your mind essence do not forget death persist in dharma

01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:49.680
 do not forget sentient beings with compassion dedicate your merit to them

01:09:49.680 --> 01:10:02.560
 then as a sweet way to conclude our own precious amazing vajra master

01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:06.560
 Venerable Kempo Samoan Dhoni Rinpoche wrote a spring poem

01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:18.560
 may we become more grateful for everything may we learn instant forgiveness may we never forget

01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:25.200
 precious friends may we become more skillful in actually causing the happiness of others

01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:33.200
 may we never lose sight of the holy dharma may sangha become one

01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:47.200
 thank you
