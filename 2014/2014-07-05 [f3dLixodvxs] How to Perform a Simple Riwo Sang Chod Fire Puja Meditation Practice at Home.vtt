00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.920
 So this will give you a little bit of a brief overview of the instructions of the Riwo Sang Cho,

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:14.480
 even though this is already mentioned here at the beginning here in the page one,

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.360
 in the footnote or in the Mountain Burning offering, it is instructing taking from the

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.320
 lottery with the Dharap, because this I think the Great Master of Terton will discover these

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:32.240
 Terma teachings around the 18th century. In the 18th century, he was one of the great

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:42.240
 masters with the Dharas and also crazy yogi travelers and he traveled all over the border

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:53.280
 and countries and he was also I think I'm a great Terton and as well as the disciples of the very

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:05.200
 famous young man Terton, whenever you heard his name and so forth. So this is his Terma teaching

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:11.920
 and due to do these practices prepares and it's become also very very popular to all the young

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:19.280
 Masculs, Tibetan Buddhists and now particularly in the outside of Tibet, it's this convenience,

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:26.160
 easy, even many Geritathons, the reward and a lot of teachings of the offering prayer,

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.040
 song is a generally purification prayer, so there's a lot of purification prayers,

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.640
 but this is very condensed and easy and a simple way. So that's it and so here

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:46.320
 said some I think things such as a good call it a word, so that means a good call it a word means

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.880
 no insect, no insect that I mean the word is all good and in ancient time but now they said

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.520
 there's a lot of like treat to all those are not maybe good because there are some poisons,

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:05.840
 poison aspect is not good and always like pray good word no insect and said no treat to word I

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:14.640
 think also and unless you know what the ingredients are but they're old and no animal food and no

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.320
 anything that is so no insect, so that is a good good call it is okay. Yes

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:43.040
 a red a red zen, they were friendly pretty chipmunks are very friendly

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:52.720
 so that is a good call it a word and then here they prepare things such as good call it a word

00:02:52.800 --> 00:03:01.920
 and that is like was personally good and then incense, anything that fragrance again not really

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:11.200
 poison animal product or anything those and so so incense, incense and then medicines all the

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:28.720
 other medicines and then he said three whites and three three substances so that three white

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:37.280
 this is a dairy product such as butter yogurt yogurt and cheese cheese those are like in

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.800
 ancient time known as like garzam so those are three white things things dairy products

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:49.840
 oh whatever the ingredient you got the dairy products yogurt milk cheese or maybe one of those

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:58.000
 but don't need too many many oh sorry butter butter not cheese butter milk and yogurt and

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.780
 then cheese too a little bit but not don't make too many liquid if you uh making this as the

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:05.360
 burning

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:14.080
 and so and the target really is sweet substance honey molasses rock sugars and then flowers that

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:21.760
 is the kind of principle ingredients flowers also fresh unused particularly dedicated for that

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:27.520
 have you already have the some the flower that used already and then of course you will put it

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:33.760
 blessing that so it's kind of somehow trying to be keep clean and the really dedicated the first

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:39.120
 portion of that those things those all so the apple of substance is everything

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:48.640
 so that is the all those blessings and then also trying to those when you make those ingredients

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:54.800
 trying to do this with the kind of clean first wash your hand and then even cover the like

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:01.280
 what's called the mouth with not breathing or not splitting we won't nobody will do the

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:06.400
 purposely splitting but again talking with someone and preparing those things could be

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:12.000
 go the split inside so they're trying to kind of make only teaching say they're trying to keep

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.920
 clean and then also the ball should be clean nicely so it's really cleaned once and clean

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:25.600
 ball clean and prepare those those and well you're preparing those if you can join some mantras

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:31.680
 such as celebrate just subtle mantras or three syllable mantras which is you know simple one the

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:40.080
 join those prayers and that's it and then light the fire those are the like the good call it

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:49.040
 wood as already said the light the fire fire so this again it said the the nice wood nice fire

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:54.080
 is really important i mean it depends how much ingredient offering that you have so

00:05:54.080 --> 00:06:00.720
 everything have to be burned burned ever you can that's the good every can so therefore a nice fire

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:09.440
 nice fire and that is stone and fire there's a lot of uh what's called fire fire what

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:18.640
 everything with these there's a lot of fire chambers kindling or no coal coal with fire so

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:26.400
 this is really good strong so that can burn burn nicely and then light fire light fire i mean you

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:33.760
 know so those are light fire and it's in the spring day with clean water say this is a clean

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:39.760
 water ever you already have the practice you have the already ritual object and the clean water is

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:45.600
 then from the pumpa also we not just put the clean water usually also we joined some mantras such

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:46.160
 as

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:58.880
 oh those are like praise that you really blessed that water water is become this cleansing water

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:04.400
 the blessings of the all the buddhas are merged into that water so and particularly

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:14.800
 such as the uh the veggie kundali all the like SS like veggie uh those are the cleansing

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:20.240
 very famous and the veggie sattvas cleansing water so this and then with the ram yang kong

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:25.120
 so it's a blessed the ever you don't have to immediately there and just get some clean water

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:32.550
 fresh water again unused water water not left over or something but trying to get fresh spring

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:33.280
 water

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:41.840
 and clean the bowl really one uh the one branch like such as uh leaves put that in the bowl so

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:49.040
 so that you can spring so uh small leaves i mean this is a little more elaborate way i'm talking

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:56.000
 i mean you know we do the fire video always many times so you know so that so that clean water

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:03.200
 and that will spring that but i mean you can spring this time or you can afterward you can

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:09.680
 spring that one that we do with all the blessings and now so all the preparation and put those

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:10.080
 things

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:17.200
 also in higher places it is all offering included unibels leaves and leaves are of course always

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:25.760
 as i said no insect i really avoid the insect but otherwise fresh leaves such as not bosom

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:31.440
 and the leaves are highly suggestive in the teaching of dangarupima sambhava and tradition

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:39.600
 or lineages and stochium is unibels unibels and then these cedar trees opine tree leaves and as

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:48.560
 well as uh sages sages but again check the insect fresh leaves and then maple tree all the fruit

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:55.200
 tree leaves are good leaves of the fruit tree tree is in the teaching said it's good all that

00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:01.760
 and then firewood as i said like the good excellent wood and that again it can be like if you have

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:01.920
 the

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:09.200
 fold you can have like such a sandal wood red sandal wood white sandal woods so forth you have

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:16.800
 opportunities so i'm in them but if not as i said no insect the the wood that don't have

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:24.720
 so all those prepared and put all in a little bit higher places as we do higher place places

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:30.960
 and the leaves or the we are going to put not stepping over it's the offering now offering

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:35.920
 as you know it's the same offering as in his mind we put the thermals all that we're not going to

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:42.960
 step over all this so it is highly honored highly respected highly blessed and cleansing something

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:53.840
 that we feel is it is special it is special is something that makes it clean and purifying and

00:09:55.280 --> 00:10:01.200
 cleansing that's so not stepping over and of course here we don't have the facility or somehow

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:06.640
 we did in the area when you put the leaves here we always put on the ground kind of that but

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:12.960
 otherwise a really nice platform and put that those people it pulls something nicer but even

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:21.920
 not we're not stepping over and it's offering dedicated now that keep as it is so all those are

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:27.920
 prepared once they prepare that and then target with you as you see have the shrine of you can

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:32.800
 i mean those are elaborate ways as when we do the fire pugia we have the beautiful shrines and

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:39.600
 my takwa and you all eating it and liars as that you all eating those those are the shrines is

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:46.080
 beautiful to do this with these things once they're completed now you have to take this rafuddhi

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:53.200
 look at this rafuddhi in both bodhijada and then this seven branch offering of purification

00:10:53.200 --> 00:11:02.240
 so this is and now we need to practice and when this is the offering and offering generally is

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:10.240
 what according to buddha stitching in general the subtle level it is dana paramata dana dana

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:18.080
 paramata and this dana paramata all is combined with six paramatas six paramata practices and

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:23.920
 again when we do the practices there's two accumulation practices wisdom married practices

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:29.760
 and accumulation married practices and the wisdom married the practice is meditating

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:36.320
 meditating absolute state of true nature as this transcendental what's the practice zokin or

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:45.680
 mahamudra or banjaparami that's the accumulation practices is what it is generosity morality

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:56.160
 and patient and as well as uh joyful effort and then also in some teaching of often grade master

00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:04.880
 said even concentration is still considering as like like what's called accumulation married

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:10.080
 because it need you concentrating something you're holding your focus or something

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:17.440
 but out of the free from the focus and free from any any reference point that it starts

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:25.920
 it and the practices so now when you have i think when sorry when when you when you prepared all

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:33.440
 those beautiful clean nice these things and all this with your best cover practice any the all

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:41.360
 those offerings that is dana paramata that is dana generous practice generous can be offering

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:47.760
 generous can be sharing giving to the others something that and when you do that so nicely

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:53.840
 clean and beautifully so beautiful eating yet something so appealing when you see i feel i'm

00:12:53.840 --> 00:13:00.800
 doing my best when others see also oh how nice i really wow all the organizing reading you made

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:08.400
 so beautiful nice that is morality clean this is what then makes it cool everything become cool

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:15.600
 right nice and cool they say wow it's cool really that's the pool morality meaning is also really

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:22.560
 cool too in the teachings shala shala means cool that and all this kind of you have to go to the

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:27.120
 difficulty a little bit all these things heart shape but it's not big heart shape but that is

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:34.400
 patience patience and even this is some difficult troubles you you kind of move for that joyful

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:40.480
 effort and concentrated on the purity and the devotion the joy in the body that is

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:49.200
 bhayam or the concentrated parameter practices and then wisdom so therefore i mean this is such a

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:55.520
 special in the in vediana teaching has so many scope of means practice that speed up to bring

00:13:55.520 --> 00:14:01.680
 the realization and cleanse and purify all our obstacles and observations and benefit with all

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:08.160
 the beings and so therefore this is very special practice so put that so so nice beautifully and

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:17.390
 then we take we now going to this offering offer is generous and this is then in the teaching

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:17.680
 always

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:23.600
 it is here you will go through whenever you already know this we are going to invite when you have

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:23.760
 the

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:29.360
 offerings and the others you are going to share that to someone now to whom we are going to share

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:35.520
 that we're going to share to the four classes of the guest four guests in the teaching said four

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:43.600

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:06.720
 going to spread this freely to everyone and who is a karmigli strongly connected guest maybe there

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:12.720
 is someone that who is karmigli connected who didn't got exactly everything what they want

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:19.120
 from us there could be any visible beings could be visible beings could be anyone's maybe still

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:26.400
 only something that they want not satisfied with us and feeling that they want more something that

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:33.440
 that is called the karmigli connected okay then and habitually karmigli connected those are the

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:40.320
 four class of beings first to do this we're going to feel the strong presence of the the honor of

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:47.290
 our guests honor of our guests and tegrapher that is then buddha dharma sangha is said buddha dh

00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:47.440

 sangha and the parigula that embodies by the gurupya mussambo here and so we tegraphers

00:16:53.600 --> 00:17:00.640
 tegraphers and before this we met a refuge on my home all my own the same things in the video

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:07.920
 and the tiki the you all we all started this all these the oldest phenomena are enlightened state

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:14.400

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:20.800
 back this offering and these generations all phenomenon for every phenomenon that the

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:26.800

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:27.200
 refuge here see the last line is we take refuge you know also all the beings maybe cross the over

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:34.480
 over the unenlightened existence that very reason the deep down taking refuge is not just the only

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:41.200
 to fulfill the purpose of our own goals but goals of every living beings that is the primary goal

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:45.760
 so do this three times for the strong purism of gurupya mussambo

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:52.400
 as you know as embodiment every and then gurupya mussam surrounded by the Buddha and all the

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:58.960
 lineage masters those mind to mind awesome i mean all those three lineage masters that and that

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:05.840
 that with that then develop the bodhicata and again bodhicata is this strengthening your

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:11.360
 your compassions your understanding your our realizations our realization of the inner true

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:18.240
 nature origin and nature what we inherit and kind of bring up that realization clearly that i'm

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:24.480
 going to bring everyone to their organ state and that is my determination that is my courage

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:32.560
 commitment in that luminous status and that is again he said he said see this and do it three

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:39.280
 times and then did these four seven branch offering practice again is all in zoki status

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:48.160
 zoki status and then this one up and others so with that realization we take three times taking

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:56.160
 rafu again bodhicata and then the seven branch offering practices and all this is that and then

00:19:56.160 --> 00:20:11.840
 again re-strengthen

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:27.760
 and now we're going to visualize now this is again a re-strengthener of the veneration

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:31.920
 the guest of the venerations this time we're going to visualize the truth

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:37.840
 ourself as in a gurupya mussambo status and as well we're going to also visualize

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:45.280
 gurupya mussambo right in the sky sky inseparable this is like mirror images mirror images and then

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:51.040
 is the visualization and gurupya mussambo already sit here and you know that and then join the

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:56.880
 mantra of gurupya mussambo now when you join this gurupya mussambo as long as you have time

00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:03.680
 when you join this and this this time and then now you're going to read that clear visualization

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:13.200
 then we're going to make this the the cleansing purify now this is the here sit ramya come and

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:18.640

 ram is the western fire yam is the western the wind calm is the western water by these three

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:44.160
 you're going to purify that so this becomes so exhortable stainless offerings offerings and then

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:51.840
 join this brace sit here based on the emptiness burn substance transformed in exotable america

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:57.600

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:07.360
 offering objects and that is again with the with the mantras ram yam is completely ripped oh wow

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:15.680
 om is is like everything purified ah ah when you try it is expanded home when you try it

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:22.400
 completely transferred the stainless like what's the necklace and we those thought and this this is

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:26.880
 like the very famous buddha teaching again of course everything is buddha teaching so

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:36.320
 that is like sky trail your mother is like sky trails it opens it endless is a mother with mother

00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:43.120
 and you know there's a mother mother in a regular day in a mantra and a blessing all that works

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:48.560
 all that works is really become in that status that status

00:25:55.040 --> 00:26:00.240
 and join this three times and then you're going to now what is you see here

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:06.080
 city is is already here so it's then now that the wrist wrist strengthen of that

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:14.240
 that that object offerings that so this here argue the pleasing of the senses of the mundane

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:15.040
 existence

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:19.440
 and then some higher substances and that blessed by the three syllables become the

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:25.280
 vasra amartas and then it's just a place to everything and now what to do

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:46.080
 this and then we look to here here then we move here these are the offer to the llamas

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:54.320
 now this is lama yada dakinis and all the however the buddha's middle of the ten directions

00:26:54.320 --> 00:27:01.200
 those are the honor guests buddha in garabemma some of the buddha that in all that in honor guests

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:08.240
 and then here said all the other guests are rambling lord of lands all the dharma palas

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:14.400
 this is zambulae here and the teaching said but all the dharma palas lord of the lands

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:22.960
 and including lord of lands that this is qualified guests and then six kind of beings

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:30.320
 and that is is all the comparison of guests and then particularly those who

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:37.360
 particularly designed kind of like highlight of this those whom or the karmic deaths

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:47.760
 and then this is karmic connected guests karmic connected guests treat that who does in a kind of

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:54.000
 invisible ways those have those beings invisible and those who always make some troubles what

00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:02.960
 called malicious malicious and this this that and all this highlight of everything now to them what

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:09.520
 you all of them now the debt and then again of course highlight here too more back page

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:17.840
 page and a demon and all these things in the page 10 and all that that as as that flame burns

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:25.200
 and now karmic deaths are quickly paid back to them highlighted to particular that and then as

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:31.840
 well as every living beings things and they got what they got all this like what they said and

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:38.400
 then continually said here said we from the intention that this desirable qualities be

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:45.040
 inexhaustible this this generic translation is also kind of a little bit awkward and kind of like

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:45.200
 in

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:51.920
 my mind mind but that i mean we couldn't really corrected it for a long time he's using the same

00:28:51.920 --> 00:29:00.800
 thing but anyway so this is the what you dedicate and then then here that and so this is continuing

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:07.840
 so those are all particularly pulled for those those that and then here next page page 11 in

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:13.760
 the middle of that each flames atoms contain the entirely phenomenal world and then this is and

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:20.400
 again this is here said that to all those at the honor of a guest offering to the all honor of a

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:26.800
 guest that's again and then this is a highlighted the offerings to the next page poetry or generous

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:32.720
 practice all the like beings of the sixth the compassion the guests all the six rams and then

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:38.240
 particularly those who are inhale rams every day at least so now everyone those are karmically dead

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:45.830
 dead and as well all the beings of sickness what i want or what i like to propose is every all

00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:46.160
 three

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:53.120
 rams are transcendent become the rainbow body and greek the enlightenment that is told and that is

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:59.920
 offering and when you make this offer so when you make this fire also with as you see that

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:05.840
 also there is always a knowledge that you learn with the traditional being there also you learn

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:11.360
 not just only from the pepper from the talking talking but being there you will learn you see

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:18.880
 we will make the fire also we try to make more smoke not just only kind of like the pie and then

00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:25.040
 just can't be dead have to make more rich rich abundance of the smoke and the abundance of the

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:33.760
 fire and tensile strong and good is a good fire good what's that so this is then with that giant

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:42.240
 and recited this month as many as that's it that's it and then now with that fire Buddha

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:47.760
 so this is the more kind of according the the more elaborate way but the condenser way more

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:54.480
 simple way and again i saw even his own dunyul himself doing with the incense with a small

00:30:54.480 --> 00:31:01.680
 incense that really in yoshi nyompo in new york city his whole incident every day this rava samyul

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:09.760
 practice but he used incense and big in the time when he asked to like the incense the

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:15.440
 kind of he laughed to me looking to me laughed because he thought he saw because i was that was

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:22.240
 for some mysteries so the one instance but that's it he's doing the incense and incense also these

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:31.680
 days designing they said special incense for the rava samkyu must be you see i would do think okay

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:39.280
 that's it yeah yeah yeah yeah they said i have two two here look at this i have these two so we

00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:44.080
 i will use this something because i thought to really make nice fire and then we do the

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:52.080
 let in the fire but this is this lightning is not burning as i thought so anyway so you use this

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:59.760
 incense incense or any incense then if you don't have this incident any incident but the intention

00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:05.520
 regularization meditation is saying whether it's a big in offering things you have or is a small

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:14.640
 instance your will your meditation that instant steak is now transformed in exhortive offering

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:21.840
 by the power of your meditation mantra and the mother's that's it and with this offering so then

00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:28.400
 you do all these offerings then i mean offerings and kind of mantras and prayers is among three

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:36.800
 syllables and then then you say finish this i say i mean all this is translated so i won't go over

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:41.520
 but the purpose is to i mean all this beautiful and the rava samkyu is

00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:52.000
 considered very special practice actually there's three fire putas in the in the virgina teaching

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:58.880
 tradition one is called the gymsig gymsig is elaborate one that which we do again brutally

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:05.440
 in the in new york city every year at the john jones place that's called the gymsig and the second

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:16.800
 is known as song this is the row samkyu samkyu and third is known as sor sor sor s-u-r i think

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:27.040
 just a pronunciation so the gymsig g-j-i-n-s-e-g gymsig is very elaborate the way and make a

00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:35.040
 medal and all that that is elaborate one and the second one is sung practices which is this

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:44.400
 and the third is soul practice sor is particularly during that ceremony for the deceased person or

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:51.040
 the invisible beings with our luck most of our lucky shorts practice visualize our lucky disorder

00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:59.600
 and doing that offering again is the same thing purpose is the same gymsig is more more designed

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:06.880
 to the highly honored guests highly honored guests the gymsig is and this song and and the song

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:14.560
 and the soul ceremony of the with the pie is the same thing with the forecast you're making offer

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:21.920
 for guests that and but of course the gymsig all the to the to all the beings to but particularly

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:29.040
 highlight to the honored guests and throw that benefit to everyone so that's so this and this

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:35.880
 always the master creative teacher his own dungeon and kenji and bardeshe always says this row sam

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:36.160
kyu

00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:42.640
 is really combined everything it is like gymsig it is like what i forget saying of course song is

00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:49.120
 purification and cleansing purification and the third is the soul practices is also that so it's

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:56.880
 very combined special practices and then you do this this practices and that is my uh i think the

00:34:56.880 --> 00:35:04.400
 brain kind of told me you have any questions out of this yeah there's a there's a couple of

00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:04.960
 numbered

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:12.320
 things in here that i'd like to know what they are if that's okay on page three when we do the

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:19.680
 bode chita we talk about through the poor spontaneous visions you don't have to just

00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:29.360
 i'll look at the page three oh yeah yeah four four this uh

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:35.040
 four is this i'm sorry sorry the supreme sick the clear light

00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:41.600

00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:47.440
 oh for a
