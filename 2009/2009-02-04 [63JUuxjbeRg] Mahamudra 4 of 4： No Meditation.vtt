00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.400
 The teaching is based on the moment, moment of experience or realization.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.800
 And here again, the problem is, I think, 40 years now.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:18.400
 So the nature of the mind is awareness, emptiness, emptiness and awareness.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:24.900
 That is the mind. That is the mind's nature, mind's identity, mind's culture.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.400
 Here I am going into it, and this is the old inner.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.800
 This is the old inner. That is the next simple way to know.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.000
 It is, that is what mind is, emptiness and awareness.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:06.800
 There is already an expression of this mind as so many varieties, so many combs.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:14.800
 There is not really the directions of the mind coming, but each of those is the same color.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.000
 Awareness, emptiness, is authentic in view.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:29.600
 And the awareness and the mind are one's nature.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.800
 There is no difference. It is one single state of display or single state.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:02:00.440
 It is one single state of display or single state of display or single state of display or single

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.800
 state of display.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.800
 These are the things I think they are all in one single state, or same.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:11.800
 That means it is not just one, one, like kind of like one, but it is just the same nature state.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.800
 Same nature state.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.800
 No, you do three times, you do better, you do two times.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.800
 And then relax again in that nature state.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.800
 When you relax in that nature state, there is nothing too close to meditation or effort meditation.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.800
 Therefore, it is called normal meditation state.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.800
 Here you can read it. That is dharmakaya state.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.480
 Can I hear all minus and then release, experience the realization of the natural and the result of

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.800
 this, again, continually, six out of five.
