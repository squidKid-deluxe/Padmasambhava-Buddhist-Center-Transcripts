00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.520
 "It's so important. This trust in confidence is not believing. Not believing, presuming,

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:16.720
 'Oh, I just hope so, I think so.' That is not pain, I saw. It is. That is how we investigate,

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:23.040
 for example, mind. You always, for example, what we're in the teaching, say, 'Where is mind?'

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:32.960
 So what are the answers? Where mind comes from? Where mind is? Where mind when?

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:42.560
 Our mind is going. If we analyze, or if we analyze in these three ways, there's nothing we can tell

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.560
.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:53.620
 Each time we are completely on the speechless status, 100% the one, we are in the speechless status

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:53.920
.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.440
 Where mind comes from is, maybe, if we heard the first time in our lives,

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.360
 where mind comes from, somebody says, 'You will think maybe it's a cuckoo, or she is a cuckoo.'

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:14.080
 But in reality, there's no answer. That's just a saying. No answer. Speechless.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:20.560
 What in the Zen teaching says the coin, I think? It's the coin. Where mind comes from?

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.920
 So, thinking of the past, where mind stayed past time. Where yesterday our mind stayed?

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:35.360
 Our physical stayed in our home and slept in bed. Where am I?

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:42.000
 Where exactly? Where yesterday's mind? Where person's mind? We presume here,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:51.440
 but where? And where is going tomorrow? So, this is what is called, in the teachings,

00:01:51.440 --> 00:02:01.520
 Sun and Rosam. Coming, going, existing, or place stay. If you think there's no answer,

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:08.960
 it's speechless. Then we think of your mind, what is it, any colors, formations.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:17.200
 If you think that way. If you ask that, if it's mind, if there is mind, what color of mind?

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:27.200
 Mind. What is this? What formations are? Everything you ask questions. Really,

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.840
 every ask that question. There is no answer. For that reason, and again in the Gohen Gharber

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:34.160
 teaching,

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:45.440
 what is it? Mind is not male. Mind is not female. Mind is not trans-gentle. Trans-gentle?

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:53.200
 Trans-gentle. Mind is free from the male. Mind is free from the female. Mind is free from the

00:02:53.200 --> 00:03:01.200
 trans-gentle. Mind is free from the color. Oh, yellow, black, and white, or any other colors.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:10.320
 And it's free. There's nothing we can identify. When you see that, this is when you ask your mind,

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:17.520
 and my mind, where has been, where is now, where is future, what is my mind, the color, this and

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:25.600
 that thing. We don't have the answer. When you didn't see anything, then what the teaching said,

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:33.600
 and you, your own intelligence, our own intelligence proved, validated. Now that's what it is.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:45.200
 Now that is the will, the nature of the mind. That is your will. Now you're going to maintain that.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:57.360
 That maintaining is known as meditation. All that you behold with your own or our own intelligence.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:06.800
 Meditation, if I use another example, meditation is now you are moving forward with that.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:18.240
 What you see, now you're moving forward with confidence, with trust, because you validated

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:26.960
 yourself, and the Buddha validated it. And lineage teaching validated, those are known as three

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:38.290
 validates, validates of the Buddha, validates of the lineage, and validated by our own intelligence

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.400
.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:45.600
 Now, that's it. We don't have to be doubt and hesitated and these and that things.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:54.000
 Now, if you continually take the journey, and just take that journey with joyfully,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.560
 with great, great, happy confidence, and with devotion, thanks to the all great,

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:06.000
 such as the Buddhas and the great Masters who really, Buddha taught this teaching, and all these

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.840
 lineage Masters maintained, and the continued effort is completely matured, their mind,

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:19.600
 and benefited others, and now we are connected, we can recapture our own, the domain of the true

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:28.160
 nature, that which is long time dominated by the false imagination of our own dualities.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:35.760
 How wonderful, how beautiful, thanks grateful, and then follow me back. And with that, then.
