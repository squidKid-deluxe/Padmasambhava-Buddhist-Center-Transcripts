00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.300
 "Good morning everyone and welcome, welcome everyone. We strengthen our beautiful motivation

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.640
 and attitude and that is really the foundation of the practice or the teach, our practice

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:27.400
 and our teaching and that is our path and direction, that is our practices and the teaching

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:33.760
 and the direction and that will be our result and the goal, achievement will be that and

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:44.400
 that is good motivation. Good motivation is joy and appreciation, bodhicitta, purity, understanding

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:53.320
 of the nature or purity of the realizations. That is what peace is. And then with devotion,

00:00:53.320 --> 00:01:02.080
 all combined that worry, as I said, that worry is our path and our practices, that worry

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:11.160
 is our goal and achievement and it's simple to tell again that is Buddha nature. That

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:19.560
 is how we are going to discover. This discovering is not just begin later, this discovering

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:30.040
 is begins right now with our self. Therefore, we call as known as teaching, practiceness.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:36.920
 We are practicing glorifying our beauty and our nature and you know that and I know and

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:43.880
 this is what not just knowing is enough, we are trying to activate that. Activate that

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:52.400
 midst of all these publications, dualities and emotions, this raging fire, every direction

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:58.200
 that we are kind of midst there. They are not really important. They are not beneficial.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.960
 They are not beneficial. In fact, you all know these emotions, the disturbances. Disturbing

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:12.520
 our joy and peace, happiness and joy and peace and happiness, our friend, our family, our

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:21.040
 neighbors and then all everyone. So, it's not really doing any good things. Therefore,

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.480
 with our intelligence, with our, we are beautiful human beings, with beautiful intelligence,

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.880
 therefore, we should make the difference ourself. That started with our beautiful motivation,

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:39.640
 I said. Motivation is everything. So, therefore, we just really ignited these qualities and

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:47.080
 if that we ignited that beautiful qualities, that will transcend all things. When we increase

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:57.080
 the joy and the appreciation, that will transcend and remove, dispel the suffering, sadness

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:05.120
 and as well as miserable, it really will dispel. Dispel, it will dispel. That is the most powerful

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:12.080
 remedies. We are having big emotions, such as anger and jealous and hated, thought and

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:18.600
 worry and stressful. Stressful and deep break and all those anxiety and all that. We bring

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:27.600
 again joy and appreciation and both each other. Really it will subside. It's not just telling

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.280
 the story of the petty story of the other side of the world or the planet. I'm talking

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:39.640
 that with our own experience, this is nugget, this is the truth. Truth. This will get great

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:46.960
 healings, our emotion scars, our, all those psychological troubles, problems we have.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:55.760
 Really, it will heal. It will, it will cleanse, it will, that is known as purification. That

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:02.680
 is known as purifying, removing obstacles, obscurations. Those are known. We have to

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.760
 be practical, not looking the other direction. That we've been doing, according to the Buddha

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:14.640
 teaching, from the beginning time, we're looking almost always at the wrong time, wrong directions

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.880
 and thinking of the solutions and all these, that things. But really solution comes with

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:27.320
 our heart, your heart, with my heart, with this motivation. Knowing that, knowing that,

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:35.280
 therefore, all the incumbents, all the beautiful things, it's right with us, with you and with

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.000
 me. Joy and appreciation, it's not going to have to go in somewhere and search in this

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.880
 and that. It's right with us, right with you. Ignite that, sweet on that. Put sweet on that.

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:55.600
 Joy and satisfaction. And both each other. Kind is comparable for all living beings. It's

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:03.800
 really wishing, sincerely. No one is, sentient beings, I like to be suffering, suffer bad

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:12.600
 and difficulties. Same as like me. Me, I don't like to be suffered. I don't like to be upset.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:20.740
 I don't like to have pains. It's the same. Whether they can see clearly or can't see.

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:30.480
 The feeling is the same. Feeling is the same. Pain is going through the same. This is that.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:36.560
 And that we can see. For example, the animal, all those, we kind of superpowers, we kind

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:44.780
 of use the advantages, how much they're scared, how much they're really in the trouble. That

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:52.440
 we see. Pain is the same. Feeling is the same. Therefore, when we practice them, bring more

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:59.160
 compassion, more love, more kindness. And that is also, we glorify our goodness. Our

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:04.240
 beautiful, your beautiful, my beautiful. And we benefit it. We're clearing our path in

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:11.920
 the directions. Our destination. Our destination. Destination, maybe we don't know exactly why

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:18.480
 we're good. We don't see the future clearly that. But if we make bright now, now we'll

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:25.360
 move continuously now. Today is now, but this today will move tomorrow. Tomorrow will be

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:32.200
 bright. Tomorrow will be bright. Continually shine that. We're clearing the path as a move.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:38.920
 And brighten our as a move. Then completely brilliant. Great. That is known as enlightenment.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:44.840
 Brotherhood. So therefore, again, we talk under the motivation, we strengthen this motivation,

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:49.440
 all this. But it's not just that once in a while or the beginning of the practice. If

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:55.400
 we can keep this motivation throughout the day and the night, really, that is the most

00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:01.360
 powerful practices. The whole practice in the teachings of such as the Vedayana teaching

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:08.920
 or Dzokhi teachings, the Mahamudra teaching and the Mademada teaching become so powerful,

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:15.840
 so rich, so powerful. It just glorifies that. And that's what these great beings, such as

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:22.480
 Buddha and Guru Pima, all those great masters. So follow that footsteps with that. So with

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:31.280
 those understanding, and then again, we move to the end with purely understanding and devotion.

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:37.920
 We move to the to the to the teaching. Again, teaching that principle teaching of aspects.

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:38.680
 Again, we go.
