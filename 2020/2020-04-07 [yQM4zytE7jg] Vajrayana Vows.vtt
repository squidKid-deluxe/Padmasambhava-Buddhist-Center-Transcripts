00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.400
 Participate and be with us again during the retreat. We are doing really beautiful, meaningful life

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.320
 we are doing.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:14.730
 According to the situation, the circumstance, you know that we are turning the situation into

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:15.720
 Dharma.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:23.880
 It is transformation. We are using this situation to improve our understanding and realization of

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.680
 our own beautiful forces.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:36.280
 Of true nature, with love, compassion, joy and dedication, it is wonderful. It is really beautiful.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:45.320
 According to the teaching, we are making the meaning of a very beautiful life, beautiful our lives.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:55.670
 We are not taking any kind of when it is ego tricks or anything. It truly is divine knowledge of

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.400
 the Great Teacher Buddha Shaptar Muni Murabhema Sambhava.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:05.440
 All that is great mass at home. Even though it is the kind of difficult and turbulent challenges,

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:11.920
 but we are doing really good. We should be happy and joyful with this. It is wonderful.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:20.400
 And therefore, again, we ignite it, reactivate our beautiful motivations, joy, joy and appreciation

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:20.400
.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:27.310
 And the vastness and motivation of the Bodhic Jeddah, taking over all living things, particularly

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.560
 all this time.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:35.070
 So many people are going to trouble us and challenge us. And then besides this, always going on in

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.440
 samsara, you know, we know, all of us know.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.960
 So really thinking of everyone kind of doing this is really wonderful and beautiful.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:50.880
 When we have this joy and appreciation, Bodhic Jeddah and three regular realizations, that is the

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.080
 beginning of enlightenment.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:59.680
 Believe it or not, it is enlightenment. Enlightenment is not just going to come one time, something

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:00.280
 boom.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:08.480
 Enlightenment is beginning to develop. We are in the light of the enlightenment.

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:13.860
 We are following that, what is called in the Western, in the world, Jacob's letter of the

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.120
 enlightenment.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.830
 We are really following that light. That light is not coming from outside, it is from our inner

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.960
 corner, our true nature, the Buddha nation.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:31.370
 That is China. China, it is one of the beautiful times. For that reason, I am saying that. That is

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:32.080
 true.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:40.240
 And therefore, again, we are going through our teachings, our practices, the kind of highlights of

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.000
 our own knowledges that we gain from many great masters.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 So many from the books know that I am going over again. It is a kind of putting, we support light.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.560
 So it is something that we can really activate.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:03:00.890
 That is good for any time our practice Dharma and to bring more mindfulness, more alertness and

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.560
 more consciousness.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:10.110
 That is always good. So therefore, I am doing this for all of us, for you and as well as also

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.880
 myself. So we will go over this now.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:20.290
 Now, we are talking about the foundation or the anchor of the Dharma, or particular anchor of the

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.960
 practices.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:29.700
 When the Buddha is teaching, how we learn Buddha teaching? By two ways. It is called Scriptural and

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.120
 Practice.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:38.830
 Learning the Scriptural by studying and contemplating. On those meaning, what we learn from our

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:46.180
 teachers and read the books and put that in our own intelligence, in our system, to blend it in,

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.360
 make something more reasonable, more meaningful.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:58.030
 Why? Because Buddha teaching is teaching of the way that nature is. Buddha not proclaiming anything

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.160
 what is not natural.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:09.440
 Excalivate things are. Excalivate things are as a relative truth. Excalivate things are in absolute

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:17.680
 truth. Excalivate are common in union, relative, absolute truth to union. There is no difference.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:26.470
 That is what really Buddha pointed out. For this reason, Buddha is known as great teacher, supreme

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.760
 teacher, excellent speaker.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:40.690
 That is what Nala Yuna appreciated. I, among all the speakers, among all the wonderful talks, you

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.440
 are the supreme IP homage.

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:51.600
 You are the supreme, you are the noble ones. Because the simple, direct, true, exactly as it is.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:05:01.120
 As we think about both subject level, object level, every aspect. Therefore, for that reason, we

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.000
 investigate and lie after we start teaching.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:14.510
 This is also known as intellectual. Buddha himself said, "You must exam, you must investigate, you

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:21.120
 must analyze, and then you observe. Don't think you have to believe what I said."

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:30.230
 This is also known as lies, rules of the Buddha. Not any great teacher told, "Examine rules." Excal

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:31.360
ve the Buddha.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:39.280
 Buddha don't have anything to hide, anything to cover up, exactly simple, true, natural as it is.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:45.600
 How wonderful. How marvelous. How simple also. Don't know.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:52.720
 That's what the really great teacher. Kindness, compassion, teaching. That part is this.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:58.470
 So we have to, again, when we practice the study of Buddhism, as I said, the academic or the

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:03.360
 scripture is as academic, studying and contemplating.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:12.770
 And what the final result of the academic and study is to practice. To meditate. Observe that not

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:21.620
 in the brain, hover on the brain, but observe that in heart, mental with heart, and that boosts our

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.880
 inner wisdom, nature.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:33.280
 A whole Buddhism, our old nature of the mind, or mind, is residing in the heart, not in the brain.

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:46.780
 Brain is the office of the mind. Heart is the principal residence or place where mind is, and where

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.600
 there is also Buddha nature.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:07:00.020
 Or in any of my schools of Buddhism, youthful, vast, body. They are all indestructible. Nature of

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:06.560
 the wisdom is residing. Write it. That's what we have to develop.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:13.970
 This is not just going to discover. That nature is not going to discover by intellectuals. Not just

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:17.360
 speaking. Not just verbalizing.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:25.220
 But we have to observe. That teaching mandates that with full of joy, full of appreciation, and

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:35.420
 courage, and commitment, determination. All those tools that the mind offers, use those as needed,

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:38.960
 and move forward at one second.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:46.370
 That is known as following the teachings of the greatest teacher, Buddha Shatramana. So

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:52.210
 particularly when he comes to the practice, and that is this full renunciation thought. What are we

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:57.840
 going through? It's the anchor of the practices.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:05.250
 It is the beginning of the ashra. If we have full renunciation, the ashras of practice are more

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:07.760
 perfect, more nice.

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:13.850
 As I said many times, you know. And the teachings say it is true. When we are reflecting the

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:20.260
 British life, operating this human body, when we are reflecting the impermanent, when we are

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:25.080
 reflecting the meaning of the cause and the effect that are inevitable, when we are reflecting the

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:28.560
 samsara is a lot of difficulty, troubles or sufferings.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:38.120
 When we reflect those points, what it does immediately really makes our heart more subtle, tender,

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:44.560
 calm, more open, more mellow, more nice. It becomes more practical.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:52.500
 When you practice, we should be practicing with that. More simple, donged out, and more practical,

00:08:52.500 --> 00:09:00.580
 more with common sense. That's what really it does. For that reason, many times, you neglect those

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:03.560
 masters of the practice, the lineage, always.

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:10.380
 If you don't reflect on these four renunciation thoughts, in each time of the practice, maybe you

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:17.060
 are really at the beginning of our period of the practice, maybe you are in good practice, but the

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:22.560
 middle and end is going to become scattered, our thoughts and intentions.

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:29.970
 When we have this poor, boneless thought in the heart of the mind, it becomes a brave target, more

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:37.350
 targeted, settling our mind, more calm and more beautiful, so that we can really fly so beautifully

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:41.560
 on our crucial levels. That is how it is.

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:59.610
 Therefore, I am going again, as Japji Duneung Muja told, and I am going again on these little more

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:00.200
 details, each point. Little details, not big details, but little details, again, in the purpose and

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:06.380
 aims to spotlight our knowledge, our understanding, that we learn from our great teachers and from

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:08.560
 the books, so I am going through this.

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:16.660
 That way, again, I went already to the laboratory of the practice of the life of the human body,

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:24.560
 any permanent, and now, cause and effect are inevitable, which is actually also karma.

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:32.490
 Outside, everything is completely on the best upon the cause and effect. Deep down, cause and

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:37.560
 effect is as I said the other day, I mean, you know, it is known as interdependent culture.

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:43.560
 It depends on the co-ordination. Everything is connected. Everything is dependent to each other.

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:53.700
 There is nothing, one single object, arise by itself without any connections, without any interming

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:54.560
les.

00:10:54.560 --> 00:11:02.190
 It is all connected, whether it is big, whether it is small, or whatever it is, it is all connected

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:11.560
. Everyone is cooperating together directly, indirectly, closely, long-distancely, all is connected

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:17.560
 and things arising, whether it is good or whether it is bad, it is all happening.

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:23.930
 Who is the instrumental of that? According to the teaching, particularly this positive and negative

00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:32.560
 is present in our mind. Mind is instrumental, is directing these things.

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:39.970
 In mind itself, as I said, and we all know, we all heard from teachers, and in the books, it is

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:47.090
 emptiness, believe it or not. I mean, it is kind of amazing. Mind itself is empty, but it is doing

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:48.560
 all these things.

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:57.250
 It is true, we never saw mind, and I never saw my mind, really, there is nothing to see. And I am

00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:06.610
 sure, in the same case, you all too, it is not just me and you, according to the teaching, no one

00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:13.560
 saw mind as solid existence, substantially solid existence.

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:22.910
 No one, that is how this mind, that is how this rule of every our perception, every our conception,

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:35.110
 every aspect of our lives, who is ruling, who is ruling, it is behind the scenes, the emptiness of

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:38.560
 our mind, that is it.

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:45.990
 So therefore, when we talk of these things, today, again, we are talking, then according to mind

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:52.680
 itself, we start to initiate it in our mind, then we are reflected to the external, we are

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:59.560
 physically, verbally, then it becomes the negative action, positive action.

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:07.420
 Even if it is initiated at the very beginning, in our space of the emptiness mind, then again, it

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:15.560
 is, that is the dawn or the beginning of the negative action, negative emotion, such as anger,

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:24.560
 jealous, head and throat, attachment, such as tense, grasping obsession of those, it is negative.

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:32.560
 Even if it is not externally reflected, projected, it is negative.

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:38.560
 What is it doing? In the individual who had that, now it has become uncomfortable.

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:47.950
 It is just rolling, it is rumbling in the mind, it is rumbling in the brain, it is rumbling on the

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:50.560
 channels and the nervous systems.

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:58.690
 Then, curdling the whole handle, curdling the resist, and targeting someone, you reject, or we

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:03.560
 ejected that, reflected, and then it is called negative action.

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:10.550
 And when it comes out, it is like tornadoes, it depends of course, big and small, but it just comes

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:12.560
, it really meant to us.

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:22.900
 How actually tornadoes started, also from the emptiness space, this emptiness space of the cloud

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:27.560
 and the wind and maybe the weather, but there is no substantial solid existing behind of that.

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:33.600
 We can detect those like weather forecast, weather means, the district of this element is there,

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:37.560
 but the element is where you look carefully, where they are.

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:47.900
 Now, there is nothing substantial solid existing further than weather means explaining, you can't

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:48.560
 find.

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:59.040
 Similarly, the space of the emptiness mind, projected of this city of the tornadoes in our brain or

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:10.540
 in our mind, projected in the marvel, physical, or projected there through the senses, eyes, ears,

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:14.560
 nose, tongues, bodies.

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:22.580
 And they continue the kind of siblings that live with that. That's how it can get into, then it

00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:23.560
 becomes negative.

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:30.970
 Same time, same way, the positives, when positives are suddenly from the emptiness space of the

00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:41.870
 mind. Mind, how? That is love, kindness, compassion, joy and evocation are initiated from the

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:43.560
 emptiness mind.

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:52.200
 According to the teaching of the greatest teacher of the Buddha, Shakti Muni, and Gaurupia Masambha

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:56.770
, other great masters, every great master, which is not just others, said, this is like the love,

00:15:56.770 --> 00:16:03.560
 kindness, compassion, joy, all this is the nature of the mind.

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:12.510
 What that means is the Buddha-made nature of the Buddha, nature. Or in other words, if I say, this

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:17.560
 love and compassion are energy of the Buddha-nature.

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:26.420
 It irradiate the energy of the Buddha-nature. Therefore, whenever we have joy and obligation, love

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:36.560
 and compassion, kindness, our mind is more calm, more peaceful, more happy, happier, more relaxed.

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:42.890
 When we reflect that well-believed or the physically, it makes happy whether it is true or that we

00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:49.560
 know. This is not something the Buddha said and we believe in that, it is true. It makes happy.

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:54.560
 Then even people will name out the peacemakers.

00:16:54.560 --> 00:17:02.660
 Peacemaker is not coming from negative emotions. Peacemaker is coming from love, kindness,

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:10.560
 compassion, openness of mind, concerning, caring towards for all the living beings.

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:18.400
 With that attitude, we would have luck in the action. Then truly, it is peacemakers. Or in the

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:24.560
 Dharma, it is known as bodhisattvas. Bodhisattvas.

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:30.840
 This is the common language. I think it is called gentle men and gentle ladies. Or ladies and

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:39.560
 gentle. Surely there are other ladies and gentle making something different, beautiful environment.

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:50.370
 Wherever they go, wherever they are, or the area, surely they are the beacon, light of this world

00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:52.560
 or the samsaras.

00:17:52.560 --> 00:18:00.370
 So that is all started with the positive, all started with the mind. Now with this thought, again I

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:03.560
 talk a little bit, I am sorry, it is just gone.

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:07.560
 So I talk a little bit about the Bodhisattvas.
