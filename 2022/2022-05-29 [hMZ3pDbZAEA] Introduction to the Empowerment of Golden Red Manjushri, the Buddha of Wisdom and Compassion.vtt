00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.530
 "Every phenomenon, every existing, both subject and object, are best on the total openness,

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:13.120
 emptiness, vastness, and total spaciousness.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:20.610
 Still, you don't recognize it. And so, the Buddha gave that teaching. Particularly, he gave that

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:21.120
 teaching

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:29.360
 because to break down, to release, our ego clinging, our grasping, our clinging, our grasping,

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:35.120
 our clinging is something completely different from the nature, from the reality where things are.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:42.560
 Because grasping and clinging means holding, something that holding tangible existing things.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:50.560
 Yet, nature is not like that. Nature is shifting, changing, transforming, its magical discipline

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.360
 status.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:59.890
 Nature is. But we don't reflect on it. We don't know that. We presume, kind of, vaguely think, or

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:00.480
 everything is saying.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:07.140
 We think that, really. We think that, for example, every day is kind of similar. Sun comes, sun

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.840
 sets,

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:14.720
 moon comes, moon sets, bright sky comes, sun comes, hey, you read them. But at the reality level,

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:15.520
 there's so

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:22.710
 much that every instant changing, shifting. Behind that, that in incidence, changes that, behind

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.960
 this,

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:31.600
 this total openness, the spaciousness. That's where the things are. Our body, our mind, our holding

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.600
,

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.600
 everything is like that. So, this Buddha gave that day teaching openly in order to break down

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:44.480
 our ego clinging, our grasping, clinging. That's what Buddha gave the teachings.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.600
 Gracious teachings, Buddha gave that teaching. And then the third turning wheel of Dharma

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:57.750
 is many explaining about, call it our mind, our nature of the mind. Our mind is, of course, we all

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.000
 go,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.440
 we have the mind. For mind, we don't see. Even our self, we really don't understand our mind.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:13.600
 Except, of course, we can say, I feel, I see, I think. For reality, we think, where is the mind?

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.600
 Those many of you all know, we went through Jockey teaching and Mahamudra teaching and

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:26.880
 Mademaga teaching. Mind is totally free from the existing. That is not something that we think in

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:35.040
 the mundane level. It's total. But even though it's total, that openness and spaciousness,

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:44.680
 the mind is not total. Excessly, yet it contains all the

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:55.520
 loving-kindness, compassion, wisdom, intelligence, joy and appreciation. All that is right here.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.720
 Those are the teachings, always say, there were many in my teachings. There was richness of the

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.680
 mind.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:08.720
 Luxuries of the mind, the mind is all here. But these luxuries, the richness of the mind,

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:16.960
 nature of the mind, never going to go away. Even body leaves, verbal communication starts,

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:25.200
 according to the teaching, mind moves forward. Mind is indestructible, cannot be relying on that

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:32.800
 fire, water, wind, earth or space, anything. It's totally, completely different.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:40.400
 Therefore, in Buddhism, mind came, mind is here, mind moves. When you come,

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:47.040
 from the beginning of our mind of strategy, it's now here. Even we don't see tangible,

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:56.160
 can hold, say, "Hi, this is my mind, we cannot do each other off there." But here, and it moves.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:03.520
 It moves with the basic good qualities, goodness qualities. Those are the teaching, making this.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:09.840
 "Tathanga Dangarva, Suga Dangarva," all the enlightened qualities, all qualities of the

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:17.440
 three Gaya, Dharma Kaya, Sambo Kaya, Nama Kaya, those all in here in the colleges. In order to

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:23.920
 explore that colleges, should that women lead to all of us, then great teachers,

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:31.840
 "Buddha Shakyamuni Giv," variety teachings on this, about the nature of the mind or "Sogadagarva,"

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:39.200
 "Tathanga Dangarva," or "Buddha Giv." Now that, the whole of the teaching, that is goal.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:45.760
 We're going to discover that our trade, that is our trade, goal of our practice, we're going to

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:46.720
 discover.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:53.280
 When we discover that, it's not just only going to benefit ourself, but according to it, it will

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:59.500
 benefit all living beings. It's not just when we discover, it's going to just benefit for all

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.080
 beings.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:06.880
 As we are process of that, it will really going to benefit ourself, benefit all beings.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:16.400
 How? By loving kindness, compassion, courage, commitment, patience, understanding, and openness.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:26.320
 And we're going to explore radiating that college to all beings and to ourself. We will be happy,

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:33.200
 our individual will be happy, strong, for same time. Going to share radiating that with others,

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:39.040
 it will inspire their "Buddha Nature," their qualities, so that they can activate their own

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.080
 qualities.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:46.160
 And according to Buddhism, of course, we all know, we all heard that. Everyone has the same nature.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:53.600
 We don't have any different nature. Everyone has, no one is exceptional, that luck of the

00:05:53.600 --> 00:06:01.090
 "Buddha Nature." Everyone has "Buddha Nature," only to wake up, only we have to wake up, we have to

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:01.200
 call

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:06.800
 that "nature." In order to do that, then "Buddha" means variety of teaching, though "turd,"

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:13.920
 "turning well of darkness." Among that, the most powerful, the most direct, most skillful

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:21.680
 means teaching, is "Vediyana Teachings." Vediyana teaching is more powerful, more direct, because

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:22.160
 why,

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:28.080
 in the teaching itself, it has a lot of skillful means practices. Skillful means, full of skillful

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:35.680
 means. So, therefore, "Buddha" gives varieties of the teachings, teachings of the Vediyana. Those

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:35.760
 are

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:42.880
 known as, then, the "Out-Tender," "Inner-Tenders." An "Out-Tender" can be divided into three

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:43.600
 teachings.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:50.110
 Those are the "Kiriya-Tender," "Oba-Tender," and "Yoga-Tenders," those three "Tenders." Any "Inner-

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:50.480
Tender"

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:57.120
 can be divided into, again, three categories. Those are known as "Maha Yoga," "Anu Yoga," and

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:02.930
 "Ati-Yoga Teachings." So, those are the "Buddha" gives those teachings. And those teachings, among

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:03.440
 these,

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:10.930
 these particular, today's teachings, the involvement of "Muhanul Giri," is the teaching that

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:12.320
 belongs from the

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:20.000
 "Inner-Tenders." This is one of the very special teachings that the great master Mohan Rinpoche,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:28.530
 who was known as, actually, Magishri came in the Humi poem as Mohan Rinpoche in the 19th century

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:28.560
 and

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:35.280
 the beginning of the 20th century. Century, he was known as, commonly known as, "Buhan Rinpoche,"

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:42.480
 all great master, omniscient, Mohan Rinpoche. He was emanation, he was a turtle, he was

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:53.520
 great scholars, writer, and the poetry, the artist, and chemists, really. I mean,

00:07:53.520 --> 00:08:02.000
 his wisdom is totally open, totally blooming. Blooming, he wrote so many very famous texts and

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:08.720
 books in order to share the knowledge with others. So, Mohan Rinpoche gives so many teachings.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:08.960
 Among

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:14.560
 that teaching, this is Thema teaching, the combination of Thema and the Gamma teachings

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:20.720
 of the "Inner-Tenders" teaching, all combined together, "Inner-Tenders" such as Mahayoga,

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:27.040
 Anoyoga, Adoyoga teachings. So, that is what I'm offering you, these teachings. And now,

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:34.240
 with that understanding, about the thing of the Magishri. Now, who is Magishri? Magishri

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:41.520
 generally is according to teaching. Teaching Magishri is total enlightenment. Buddha,

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:50.880
 even in many times, Magishri is the father of all the Buddhas, for example, father of the

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:59.120
 one thousand Buddhas of these fortunate eons. That means, according to Buddhism or the Buddha's

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:09.680
 teachings, in this eon, these one thousand Buddhas will come. And so, Magishri, in the teachings,

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:16.240
 father of all these Buddhas. How does that mean? What does that mean? In the teachings, he was

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:24.480
 spiritual father of all these one thousand Buddhas. Upon the time, upon the one time,

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:36.160
 the distorted Buddhas, among the four of them came and 996 were going to come. Those are just

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:42.720
 regular individual beings, once upon a time. They are not great bodhisattvas, they are not

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:49.440
 enlightened beings. They are regular body, regular human beings. Magishri is already enlightened.

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:49.520
 The

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:59.040
 great bodhisattvas came in the palm of the many different M&M's. So, Magishri encouraged them,

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:04.960
 this one thousand individuals, to take the, and to take rafuj and develop the bodhisattva.

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:13.760
 And because of the teachings of the Magishri, and this one thousand individually told the rafuj

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:20.480
 and develop the bodhisattva. Because of that, they continually then follow the path and reaching

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:27.920
 enlightenment. Therefore, in the teachings said, they are, Magishri is a father of the all this,

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:35.360
 or spiritual father of all one thousand Buddhas, and as well as many other Buddhas. So, that means,

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:43.520
 Magishri got enlightened so long time ago. And Magishri is, according to the dharmakaya level,

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:49.280
 is totally enlightened beings. Totally enlightened beings, or there is no other difference between

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:58.640
 samadabhadra and Magishri. Dharmakaya Buddha, Samadabhadra. Free from all the complex cities,

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:06.560
 free from all the aspects, and a total openness, vastness, inconceivable state of the Buddha,

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:15.120
 Samadabhadra. That is dharmakaya state of Magishri. At the samadakaya level, Magishri appeared as

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:25.570
 Buddha-vero channels. The very foundation of all the Buddhas, and the body aspect of all the Budd

00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:26.000
has,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:33.120
 Buddha-vero channels. And again, Buddha-vero channels, there is many, many emanations of the

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:39.760
 Buddha-vero channel appeared in different forms, in different ways. So, those are all Magishri. And

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:47.500
 then, dharmakaya level, or even in dharmakaya level, Magishri appeared many emanations of the Mag

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:48.320
ishri.

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:58.880
 Those are the Magishri, Buddha-Magishri, Renna-Magishri, Penma-Magishri, Karma-Magishri, Kere,

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:08.560
 and as well as Vedya-Magishri. There are many emanations of Magishri. And those forms are also

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:17.280
 white Magishri, blue Magishri, red Magishri, and green Magishri, and so forth. So many emanations,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:25.490
 nachos, that appeared. And that, I mean, the sambokaya emanation of the Magishri appeared in many

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:28.640
 different forms, peaceful, wrathful,

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:36.240
 and semi-wrathful. And wrathful aspect of the Magishri of the sambokaya is then very known as

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:43.840
 Yamitakas. And there's many different emanations of Yamitakas, too. So forth, all that is Magishri.

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:50.320
 And then Magishri appeared in the form of also green bodhisattvas. And it's like as often we call

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:58.720
 Ammon-ed bodhisattvas, Magishri. Magishri is one of the great bodhisattvas. And in order to benefit

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:05.920
 all the living beings, Magishri appeared in the form of the Magishri, like green bodhisattvas.

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:12.720
 So Magishri, that's what we call Magishri. And there are many emanations in ancient times,

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:17.600
 or in the Buddha's time, the greatest teacher of the Buddha at that time, Magishri appeared as,

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:26.720
 many times, his disciples, the Buddha's disciples, and the audience. And Magishri activated so many

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:32.720
 teachings, but we're constantly teaching, and the Buddha gave the teachings. There are so many

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:39.520
 teachings, Magishri appeared as like disciples, the audience who activated, accelerated the

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:40.880
 teachings.

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:47.680
 And Magishri appeared in the form of the landlords, and the young boys, young girls appeared. So

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:47.840
 the

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:55.760
 emanation of Magishri in the Ramakaya level is countless. There are no limited boundaries in order

00:13:55.760 --> 00:14:02.880
 to benefit all beings. So that is really the Magishri. And I think Magishri's teaching practices

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:10.240
 become so popular and powerful in India, and I think the very Buddhism came in the 8th century.

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:18.400
 And Gopin Masambhava bought this Magishri teaching, along with the Shandaraketa. Shandaraketa is a

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:25.360
 renowned emanation of the Magishri himself, and as well as the computational building is a renowned

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:31.440
 emanation of the Magishri, and gave all these Magishri teachings. And particularly Magishri

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:39.360
 teaching, then Gopin Masambhava gave at the Samyant mountain, mountain, at nine students. Nine

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:40.080
 students

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:51.840
 gave at-heroga teachings. Among that, then, is among the at-heroga and the jambal, and Magishri,

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:58.880
 which is the aspect of all brother's body emanation. So Magishri, the Yamintaka teachings, Magishri

00:14:58.880 --> 00:14:58.880
,

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:05.600
 Gopin Masambhava gave that, and to the nine-hearted students, and particularly that

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:12.640
 teaching that received it, become the master of that teaching, is then Sanghi-Yeshi,

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:27.040
 who becomes the famous

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:38.850
 Gopin Masambhava. And then, Gopin Masambhava, he did so many Thema teachings throughout the Tibetan

00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:39.040
,

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:45.440
 and those great Thetans, one after another, began to revel in those Thema teachings, and then

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:46.240
 continued

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:52.640
 until now. So that's how the Magishri teaching. And since the beginning of the teaching came to

00:15:52.640 --> 00:16:00.560
 be, in the eighth century, there is so many great Siddhas in the Yogi, in the Yogi, in the Yoginis,

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:09.680
 really, who reach the total high enlightenment, total practice of Magishri. So Magishri

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:16.240
 become, teaching becomes so popular. And not just the only Thema school is to be the Buddhism,

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:21.760
 Magishri is so popular to all the schools that are to be the Buddhism. Almost every

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:29.440
 those great master scholars, their personal Giti become as Magishris. They practice, meditate,

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:36.320
 all this. So this becomes one of the powerful, special practices of the Magishri, and this

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:42.960
 is the, then, particularly so, really kind of introduction about the Magishris, Magishri,

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:50.320
 and how that. And now, I talk really about that meaning of the empowerment. Again, of course,

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:55.940
 we all know that empowerment means, is very special, ten minutes. As I said early, and you all know

00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:56.000
,

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:07.360
 Vedayana teaching is full of skill means. And therefore, so many skill means, therefore,

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:13.760
 through by the practice of the Vedayana teaching, according to teaching, we can reach enlightenment

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:21.760
 within short time, or within this lifetime, or quite free generations, according to the teachings.

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:28.880
 In according to Sutra Mahayana, that we, even we practice diligently, it will take to get

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:36.160
 enlightened. Many times, eons make it. Many eons can take that. But in Vedayana teaching,

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:41.600
 and we practice diligently, follow the according, and stop the teaching, and we can,

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:47.120
 then, really, we can get enlightenment. We can see big changes within our lifetime,

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:53.440
 and then, as well as continually that. So, therefore, Vedayana teaching is named, also,

00:17:53.440 --> 00:18:02.560
 Resolve the Yana. Resolve. Then, instantly, we are activating a result, and getting resolved.

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:09.840
 Then, in Sutra Mahayana, it's like, you're making the process of the code and the foundation,

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:16.000
 and that will take time to develop the result. But in Vedayana teaching, because of all the skill

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:24.880
 means, we apply that very diligently, with joyfully, we can get resolved so soon.

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:32.080
 Therefore, this Yana, or teaching, is named as Resolve the Yana, or the teaching that captured

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:40.000
 result, result of fruit, very fast. So, therefore, named as the Resolve the Yanas.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:46.880
 So, this is the word that is the Vedayana teaching. Among that, there is, as I said, there are so

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:47.120
 many

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:54.560
 skill means, and this empowerment is, then, one of the very powerful and renowned skill means

00:18:54.560 --> 00:19:00.720
 practice. What it does, it's called a teaching, that through the involvement, that when you

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:07.360
 receive the empowerment, or when you meditate, and receive the empowerment, that will dispel

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:17.520
 the habit of the body, speech, mind, and enter the Vedara, the blessings of the Vedara form,

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:26.000
 Vedara speech, and the Vedara mind to our body. So, actually, our hidden, the invisible quality

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 of the, our body, speech, and mind, and dispel in the habit appearance. Again, I will say one more

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:41.760
 time, by receiving the blessings of the Vedara, Vedara, blessings of the Vedara body, Vedara

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:50.160
 sound, Vedara mind, or if I use enlightenment body, enlightenment speech, enlightenment mind,

00:19:50.880 --> 00:20:01.360
 it will dispel the habit pattern of the habit pattern, or the obscured habit pattern of the body,

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:10.720
 our regular body, speech, and mind, and then we get a result. We get, kind of, evoke our result.

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:17.760
 So, therefore, this is called very powerful and skill means of the practice, that instantly, really

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:17.760
,

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:27.360
 is bring up the realization. In order to that, empowerment is received by the, by our meditation,

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:35.370
 ritual object, linear blessings, and the mantras, and so those are where we receive the empowerment

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:35.520
,

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:43.520
 and it is then transcending that. It is like, for those reasons, in Sanskrit, is the empowerment

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:51.600
 named as Abhishekara, or Abhishekara, means pouring and dispelling. Pouring,

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:58.960
 meanwhile, pouring the linear blessings of the skill means, means, dispelling, what is dispelling,

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:07.600
 the habit pattern is an obstacle. So, it really created the, kind of, moment of the, the, the,

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:14.080
 awakened energies, and we continue to keep that with courage and commitment, with joy, then

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:22.480
 definitely, we get good result. Okay, we can progress. So, that's the meaning of the empowerment.

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:24.000
 That's how it is.
