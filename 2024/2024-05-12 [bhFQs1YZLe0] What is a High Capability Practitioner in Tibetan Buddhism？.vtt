00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 This teaching has three levels. Those mind sections, spirit sections, beat instruction sections,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.710
 and we are doing beat instruction section. Beat instruction section also has those four in the

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:16.000
 teaching method.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:26.830
 We are the core, the utmost, the secret, and the essence of the teaching. Why is essence? Because

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:32.000
 it is directly discovering our inner nature.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:41.200
 That is what I use as an example of cocoon. The spell of cocoon is directly connecting us to the

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:49.000
 old and our inherent nature without any detours or without any movement.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 And therefore, this teaching is also "High Capability Practitioners".

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:04.420
 High Capability means what? The intelligence, smartness, high capability of lowing kindness, high

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:12.000
 capability of compassion, love, compassion,lessness, and open heart, open mind.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.980
 Understand that, not narrow mind. It becomes a narrow mind and very twisted. That is not High Cap

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.000
ability, then twisted, twisted.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 But Zokhi teaching, the dhanthara teaching is "High Capability Practitioners".

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.670
 Therefore, you can observe all the wonderful techniques and teachings, scale into our heart and

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:39.470
 mind without any cushion in the dark and hesitation and interpret by our own ratio of the scept

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:40.000
icals.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.620
 Because it is really discovering our inner nature and looking the most "High Capability Practition

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.000
ers" in the teachings here.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.160
 So that means we are all really High Capability Practitioners in a way. Because I wanted that in

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.000
 the teachings.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.770
 The moment you are interested in teaching that, when you heard the teachings, when you heard those

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.000
 teachings in different things, you are inspired by them.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 Instead, you are trying to distance them. That is the sign of the High Capability.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:20.680
 Your nature is siddhana. Our nature of the mind is siddhana, evaporated. It is ready to activate

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.000
 that.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:29.430
 One great Master Chanda Kriti said in his teaching, "What is the sign of the great meaning of the

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:36.000
 emptiness?"

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.620
 Because when you saw the emptiness, many people were scared. Many people were scared of the

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.000
 emptiness teachings.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:50.750
 Scared and they kind of turned me, but some were not scared. One of them in teaching Kriti Chanda K

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.000
riti said, "Not just scared, but really you."

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.350
 People who heard the emptiness teachings or the Mahapanya Paramata teachings or the Madhiva Kriti

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.000
 teachings, they are so excited and happy.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.370
 Not just only that, but because the signs were there, excitement, the tears are coming from their

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:09.000
 eyes.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:17.200
 That is the great Master Chanda Kriti said, "They are connected. They have the capability to

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.000
 discover the meaning of the Pandya Paramata, or the Madhiva Kriti."

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.550
 Similarly, in the Dzogki teachings, what the great Master said is, "Those who are interested, those

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:35.980
 who are really moved by the teachings of the very energy of the Dzogki teachings, that means they

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.000
 are connected.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 They have common abilities. Dzogki teachings are not just shared by some selected groups.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.760
 The every one of these teachings is for everyone who are ready, who can practice, who can handle

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:57.000
 and who can adjust with joyful effort, courage and commitment and determination and loyalty.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 This is everyone's teeth because it explains our own innate nature, the rupa, the beautiful rupa

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 that which is residing, the otatanga, the dharma.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 Therefore, this is our teaching. This is our goal. Your mind is our imperative.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:24.190
 All the teachings as the lineage masters contributed, now we are holding them. We are adjusting and

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.000
 caring.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.350
 Therefore, again, all these reasons, I mean, this is what the understanding of the Krikaya nature

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:32.000
 states.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 Now with that understanding of the...
