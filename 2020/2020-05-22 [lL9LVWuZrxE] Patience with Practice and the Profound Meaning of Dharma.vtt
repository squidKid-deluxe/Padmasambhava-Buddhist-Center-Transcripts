00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.640
 Thank you, everyone. Thank you, thank you so much, everyone. Again, welcome, everyone. Thank you.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.560
 Thank you for participating.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:24.400
 Again, we continue to grow the teachings of the Generated Grace Teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni,

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:34.720
 and by regularly teaching, they're taught by one of the great masters and teachers in the 40

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:35.920
 centuries.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:43.920
 So, this great master taught varieties of teachings, teachings that all tell us how

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.560
 to practice on the problem of Theravana teachings, all the two very other teachings or Dzokhi

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.520
 teachings.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:59.840
 Plus, also how to be that good conduct, how to be a bigger person, how to be more kind of friendly,

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:07.600
 nice, stay in the body and in a group, more friendly environment, create a harmon in peace world.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.920
 So, something which is good for us or one's own sounds good for the others. Also, he's always

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:21.440
 give our others instructions of that, in a way, how day-to-day behaving activities of the human

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.960
 beings, you know, the societies. And the reason in the teaching always says that because when you

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:27.120
 have

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:34.480
 the good foundation of the human being, he says that is really the very foundation of the Dharma,

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:40.960
 Dharma. And from there, then we'll move to the Dharma. And so, what is really this,

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:50.320
 the human tradition, a good human tradition is that is the staircase to the enlightenment,

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:56.630
 to the deliberations. So, therefore, it's very so important. Again, really all the Buddha's

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:57.280
 teaching,

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:04.880
 for example, all those Vinaya rules and guidelines is very much best on the human tradition, how to

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:11.360
 be good, decent person, so cooperative, kind of more kind of simple or humble, more friendly

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:18.240
 environment that really would have taught that is what. And then, it's kind of like more kind of

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:28.880
 glorified, more kind of passively pointing out and instructing how to behave of our body, speech,

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:37.890
 and then of course, finally his mind. So, that's what really it is. So, all those very similar ways

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:38.080
,

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:45.280
 exactly what the great master Bhilashaktami told, as well as Nagarjuna told, and all those great

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:55.280
 masters of India, so that's what we're generally taught. But this time, particularly we're going

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:02.080
 through is like particularly teaching on how to practice of the only hermitage or the day-to-day

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:08.720
 lives. That's what I really like in teaching that if you are very so convinced, very kind of

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.400
 precisely and all simple, and it's something that not too many, kind of like many pages with books

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.920
 and all that, but simple so that we can kind of apply that. That's what it is. So, now that in

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:26.080
 that we are going, again, of course, we all know that we've been talking, you're also reading all

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:33.600
 that book. So, that's it. But again, to do this, and teaching always, always, we reactivate our

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:39.920
 beautiful motivation and intention, and that is really now because we start again. It's not just

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:47.920
 activating our motivation just now, but we have good practitioners, really, we should do that.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:55.200
 There's always as much as we can do. The day we wake up, the day we go, or time we go to the bed,

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:01.520
 bed, which, every day, in the midnight when we wake up, every kind of thing, those that reflect

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:07.600
 as much as we can. Then really, we are keeping in the course, and it's so beautiful, so good,

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:14.240
 so good, and it's so powerful, and so beneficial. So, that again, of course, particularly when we

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.320
're

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:21.120
 studying, contemplating, and meditating, practicing, then motivation is so important. So, with

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.440
 those

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:28.400
 understanding, we activate our motivation, and increase the motivation of the joy, and appreciation

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.400
,

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:36.800
 and the body, and then devotion, all the very other teachings of the beauty. So, with that,

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:45.040
 now we go as the one we've kind of summarized, the frame of the His Holiness, our Japanese

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:51.120
 teaching, and over three frames, so the first novel, middle novel, and the concluding novel,

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:57.920
 and today we are going to go directly to the middle novels. The middle novel is the recording

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:04.880
 of each other, and the actualizing of each other, that is the actualizing of each other. Now we are

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:04.880
,

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.680
 of course, we have the well. You have the beautiful motivation, which was strong as the

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:18.080
 ultimate of the intention of each other. Then, now we're going to actualizing of each other,

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:23.760
 and the actualizing of each other, there is a numerous way to actualize the body of each other,

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:30.640
 but in the teaching, what our teaching says, that all the activities can summarize in this sixth

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:38.340
 parameter. The sixth parameter is to summarize all the activities of the bodhisattvas, or bodhicata

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:38.560
.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:47.120
 Bodhicata is activity, bodhisattva practices. That is the sixth parameter. Among the sixth

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:53.120
 parameter, today we are going to the third parameter, which is the patient parameter.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:01.040
 And the patient parameter, again, the nature of the patient parameter is not disturbed.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:09.200
 That is the inner teaching, not disturbed. Not disturbed, that is the nature of the

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:14.800
 patient parameter, and we can keep up. That is really the nature.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:28.160
 Trouble with that in the teaching says, not replying, replying. That means, not disturbed,

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:34.640
 at the same time, not replying, replying. The next one is what in the teaching says,

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:45.920
 not holding that ill thoughts, ill thoughts, or what that happened, not holding, letting go. That

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:55.440
 is really important. Or, in other words, maybe resentment, not keeping resentment, letting go.

00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:04.880
 Those are the qualities of the patient, patient. Now the patient itself divided into three,

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:12.240
 four three is, as I was translating yesterday, or trying to be four days before yesterday,

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:22.080
 first one is, is patient hold the hum doors. Hum doors. All I always sometimes translate it,

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:29.920
 never mind. Never mind the attitude of any problems or the trouble that comes. Never

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:40.880
 mind attitude. But we also translate it as patient hold the hum doors. In the Tibetan world, what

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:41.040
 is

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:53.280
 it? Novrila cheme nyambasova. So patient hold the hum door attitude of never mind. That is the

00:07:53.280 --> 00:08:02.240
 one really is. Novrila cheme nyambasova. Now hum door, when we start, thank you, we all went

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:09.440
 yesterday, so I'm not going too much on this, but hum door looks like kind of big and a strong kind

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:17.120
 of gigantic hum door. But this hum door, of course that is also hum door. But hum door is something

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:27.840
 really also start with simple. Simple. Hum door is both sides, from other out and as well as from

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:28.000
 in.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:39.680
 Another word, as I use the word subject and object. Hum door is talking about religion,

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:47.760
 it was mind. We started from the fundamental source of the hum door is from the mind.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:58.960
 So therefore every subject is our mind. When that attitude of the ill pope or uncomfortable pope,

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:12.480
 or agitations, irritations, or kind of annoyances, when it started, that is the siddling of the

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:23.520
 anger. Anger, that is siddling. But every good practitioners, when that arises,

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:31.680
 as happening and kept by mindfulness, immediately, immediately trying to liberate it.

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:37.760
 What are your technique you use? Whether the techniques of the, of the,

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:45.120
 the general brother teachings, or the very inner teachings, or the jokti teachings.

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:53.840
 What are your technique? Just really contrivedly eliminated, uprooted. That is the best patient.

00:09:55.120 --> 00:10:01.760
 That is the best patient. You didn't let it come out, out of control.

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:10.480
 That is sign of good practice. Sign of, what for that reason, what a great master,

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:21.360
 Patham Bhasanji said, says, if with emotions arising, if immediately kept, or empty thought,

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:27.360
 immediately kept that right, that moment, when the emotions arising, that is good practitioners.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:37.680
 That is. But when the emotions, the negative emotions arising, and empty thought, immediately,

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:44.320
 then what's the point of the practices? We lost, we lost the identity of the practices.

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:52.720
 Practice, we practice the embedded identity of the Buddha teaching, trying to become peaceful.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:11:01.760
 And that's what in the teaching he said, do not have, not avoid all the negative it is,

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:12.480
 and the actual life, practicing all the virtues, display one's own mind. This is the teaching of

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:23.120
 the Buddha. So, if somehow we were under the control, manipulations of the negative emotions,

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:34.480
 then we become really the weak practitioners, weak practitioners. We didn't. And for those reasons,

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:41.680
 great master, Patham Bhasanji said, also in the teaching, said, defining moment of the good

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:50.320
 practitioners and not practitioners is when the emotions are arising. Good practitioners will

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:58.960
 immediately handle that moment. But weak practitioners, they didn't come out of control.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:09.360
 They didn't have a coordinate duty. It meant mess, mess. So there, this, what's called,

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:17.600
 the patience for the harm rules. Patient of the harm, patient of the skilled detectives

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:24.800
 of to the, the harm rules of our mental attitude immediately recognized and liberated. That is

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:31.920
 excellent. That is the best. Then also patient for the others when they didn't, which means

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:39.990
 they not can harm rules from coming from outside day to day our lives. When we talk with our

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:40.480
 friends,

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:47.760
 family members, also patient. That is what really is teaching. So whether we are outside in the

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:48.320
 world,

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:57.200
 whether we are inside the house, room, we always, patient is so important. It's true. The weak,

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:04.240
 weakness practitioners can't catch that. Always cover when the control, under the control of the

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:14.160
 negative emotions. But this is a good practitioner can't catch that. Catch that with my mindfulness

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:23.040
 and then immediately it is liberated, liberated. So that is the one that really the, I mean,

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:30.640
 is known as patient of that never mind, patient of the never mind attitude for the harm rules.

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:41.520
 Whether it's big and small, whatever it is, that try to be more patient. And then as in the

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:41.920
 teaching

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:48.720
 said, also when that happened, even that happened due to the weakness of practicing, but not

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:49.280
 holding

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:56.800
 too long, that or that ill thought or resentment thought holding too long, then it is really

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:57.280
 spoiled.

00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:05.040
 Instead that if you can do or if we can do, if we can do according to the teaching,

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:10.880
 recognize and feel kind of like some degree of the other that I didn't do the right and whole songs

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:17.760
 and do some practice of the various others immediately put in front. That shadow of their

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:25.040
 scan and they read this and think, pray to the Buddha's bodhisattvas that never again happened.

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:31.600
 Please bless me. I mean this not happened again or I will please bless me that I have the stand

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:38.720
 to prevent a liberated right at that moment or right at the source of the moment it arises.

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:44.960
 If we do those, those are known as the practicing the dharma, which is very good.

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:51.680
 And this patient is again, I said so many times and you all know, patient is the backbone of the

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:59.760
 six paramatas. Patient is the backbone of our practices. We need this patient.

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:11.200
 Without the patient, we become so feeble, feeble because samsara has so many challenges.

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:19.840
 This is not just for one time, a short time that, but that goes on and on. That's why, for example,

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:29.680
 the name or title of the bodhisattva practitioner known as bodhisattvas because of this samsara

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:38.400
 situation, bravery for the enlightenment. It should become the bravery means courage, confidence,

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:49.200
 commitment and never mind attitude, strong and dense and powerful and with the determination.

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:59.840
 Then the patient comes really quite good. And so that is my really talk about the first patient.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:11.280
 Patient, which is, is nozila, jimajam bhosoba or patient for the humdulos. That's the fourth one.

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:21.840
 Now this second and third are more personal level, more personal personal level instructions

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:30.000
 of courage. That means, the person means in this case, the practitioners. We all as practitioners,

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:40.400
 we are all follower of the bodhisattvas and the buddhas and bodhisattvas. Therefore, to follow

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:50.000
 the body, to follow in the bodhisattvas, then we should have all these next two different patients,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:56.080
 one after another. And this general course, all connected is not something completely different

00:16:56.080 --> 00:17:04.160
 from each other. But primarily this second and a third is for the practitioners. And the second

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:14.160
 is what is known as the patient for the practicing dharma. So that is practicing dharma, the

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:14.800
 teaching

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:24.690
 of the Buddha or practicing six parabhadhas. So we need patient to do practice of the six parabhad

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:25.040
has.

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:32.400
 Or we have to have patient to practice, such as practicing dharma. That also means

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:42.240
 we should always bring, advocate, bring the practice of dharma as our, one of the priorities.

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:48.880
 When we make the list of the old, our day schedule or live long, live long schedules,

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:57.840
 we, what sometimes we call prioritizing, prioritizing. Many times our dharma practice

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:05.920
 is almost in the bottom of that. Bottom of that. And how? We say, "Oh, if I have time,

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:15.040
 if it's a good time, I'll do the practices." That means, live long, our activity, we're not

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:23.440
 really keeping the practice of dharma as one of the priority of the practices. Or even one,

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:28.880
 not one of, even one of those. Kind of like, if we make the list, as I said, almost in the bottom,

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:35.520
 bottom of that. And then we need to come also in the bottom about how much we spend the time

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:46.160
 to the practice. And how much we spend the time for the, all the other chores and our activities.

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:57.360
 Again, it's bottom, almost in the bottom, bottom. All our majority part of the time we spend

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:05.760
 for, for our samsara, I think activities. Of course, which is important, which is kind of,

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:13.920
 don't stay on the front row. So it's important. But it's all in our, even in one day,

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:22.800
 dharma practice is in the bottom. Bottom, in just a short time. Many times we're talking

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:32.960
 half an hour, people in minutes, 20 minutes, 40 minutes. We're talking, that is. And then

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:40.800
 when we're expecting dharma practice, can't we get so many kind of benefits, result willing to get

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:47.440
 more than what we spend the time and effort in our heart to the love we like to be.

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:55.440
 Or most of the week, become kind of like very kind of mean and elect to get big result by

00:19:55.440 --> 00:20:06.000
 the practice of the 15 minutes. Big rhythm. This is not exactly. Because we try, what we're doing,

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:13.040
 trying to do, practice, according to teaching, we try to reverse our habit patterns.

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:20.640
 That's what we're really doing practices. Not just a reversal. We like to purify

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:32.560
 our habit patterns of the negative. We have two, I say use that, we have

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:42.960
 like spiritual habits and the mundane worldly habits. Among that two, which is more.

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:53.120
 We have mundane worldly habits, more than spiritual habit, because we spend more time

00:20:53.120 --> 00:21:02.800
 for the worldly, concerned. And then, because of that, that is known as ego cleanliness,

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:12.800
 self-importance. All those are according Buddhism, it's mundane, it's old, it's samsara.

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:20.800
 They are the principal pillar of samsara, or the ego cling is the pillar of the pillar,

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:29.120
 the solid pillar of samsara, self-importance. We spend more time to serve the ego cling,

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:37.760
 clinging than the egolessness. Or even not maybe mention not even egolessness,

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:44.880
 but kind of like more thoughtful, more kind of like sensible to kind of more thought for the others

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:44.880
,

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:50.640
 or thinking of all the others. How much really we spend the time? I'm talking about the mentally.

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:59.040
 How much we spend the time? If we say like hundred percent, maybe we spend

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:09.680
 for the spiritual or the Dharma, maybe only 20 minutes, 10 minutes, the 80 percent, 70 percent

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:19.920
 is at mentality of the samsaras. So, therefore, we have loaded,

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:25.040
 the loaded, the loaded of the habit dependence of samsara.

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:32.880
 If we put in the scale of the habit dependence of the samsara and spiritual habit dependence,

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:45.440
 or Dharma habit, if we put in scale, this, that samsara habit, we go up so much,

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:53.200
 and the spiritual Dharma habit is so low, it's small, it's just a scale really, just come,

00:22:53.200 --> 00:23:01.440
 or mostly, complete or mostly like what's called 80 degrees, or 70 degrees, makes it different.

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:08.720
 All that happened. So, therefore, this is the one called this samsara is heavy. It's true.

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:17.360
 The, our creation of the habit is really bad, heavy. Now, the practice of Dharma, we have to be,

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:29.760
 we have to reverse that according to the habit level, as well as our momentarily mental levels,

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:37.600
 of moment to moment mental levels, we like to reverse, we like to clean, purify. So, what,

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:45.600
 what is that means? That means we like to purify the habit dependence of the all five or six bosons

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:45.600
,

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:56.000
 purify ignorance, attachment, anger, jealous, hated thoughts, doubt, and hesitations.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:03.360
 All those, we really like to purify. We like to put more love and kindness, compassion,

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:11.680
 and wisdom, joy, and appreciation, kindness, respect, more harmony to those we like to really

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:18.960
 bring on more, bring more, the detachment, detachment, opening, we like to put more.

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:27.600
 So, to do that, then, that's what we need, the courage and confidence, we need to bash it,

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:33.280
 we need to continue bash it. And when we do this, reverse it, don't have any badness,

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:42.000
 and purify the habit dependence, it's not always easy. There's so many obstacles, so many headless

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:48.480
 comes, one up another, another. Even in short time, if we play it to do the spiritual practice or

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:55.760
 Dharma practice, almost many times we have to miss that opportunity, and miss out and do those,

00:24:55.760 --> 00:25:02.540
 that those, all the other samsarajos, habitus, Japanese. So that is, then, we become the weaknesses

00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:02.880
.

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:10.080
 Our patience and the commitment is kind of almost a demolition. Therefore, we have to have

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:16.960
 really strong courage and commitment, confidence to do practices. This practice is not just for

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:24.400
 only short, for this short term purposes. It's not like kind of cleaning up the what's called yard,

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:32.470
 or not, it's not just cleaning up the garages, it's cleaning up all our method of so many lifetimes

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:32.560
.

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:40.880
 Therefore, we should take more, kind of, strongly and wholehearted way to practice Dharma

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:47.760
 and have courage and commitment. Put this, trying to push up this, this practice Dharma

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:54.640
 on the kind of our priority, higher and higher, higher and higher, not in the bottom of that

00:25:54.640 --> 00:26:02.800
 list. List is, and whatever we committed, for example, during the daytime, for example, one hour,

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:09.440
 one hour, one hour practice, we committed trying to keep that practices. Practice,

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:16.240
 trying to keep that, not just miss out that, miss out and then just kind of jump into something

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:16.640
 else,

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:23.600
 trying to really maintain that, that is known as commitment. That's why we built up our

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:32.720
 systems, traditions, with a line of ourself in that line, which is really according to the teaching

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:32.720
,

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:43.440
 is so important. And so, that practice, patient for the practicing of the supreme dharmas.

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:49.840
 Then in all the teachings said, what in the, for example, larger level, for example, all those

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:57.040
 great masters, masters, even the Buddha, when in order to lead the enlightenment,

00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:03.120
 it's not just he got, I mean, according to the teaching, Buddha accumulated all the marriages

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:12.560
 for three commoners, he becomes the rim, rim, rim of the two accumulations. Accumulation married,

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:21.280
 Muslim marriage, completely become rim or the full, full and a complete acolyte. And then he

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:28.160
 came in this wall, gone in or take the bird in this wall purposely in order to have the benefit

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:36.560
 for all sentient beings. But even though he's that status, but he did six-year ascetic practices,

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:44.560
 six-year ascetic practices, he left his beautiful comfortable lives of the love of kings,

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:52.960
 life of prince, lives, palace, left and came, went to the root jungles with bare feet, one cloth,

00:27:52.960 --> 00:28:02.480
 one fabric cloth that he picked up from the, on the, on the site. Many times somebody offered him

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:11.440
 that, but he's that such a beautiful, expensive grace that he give up and wear that cloth and

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:22.400
 moving in the jungles with bare feet. Feet, that is a big change, what he was and what now he is.

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:32.560
 What he did, it is the practice, patient practices of the full discovery of the inner nature of the

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:41.760
 enlightenment, for sake of all living beings. After that, he did six years ascetic practices in one

00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:47.520
 sitting in the Bay of Nerengar Ravens, according to the teaching, for six years.

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:58.800
 And there is not much food, not much food. In the teaching, say this part of, first every year or

00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:08.320
 every day, he had two grains of the grains every day, every day for two years. And last second two

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:17.840
 years, drink drops of the waters, waters. And the last two years, even none of, nothing but those

00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:24.560
 two things, he continued meditating practices. Because his power of the meditation and meditation

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:31.520
 pool, nutrition, he kept life. But externally looking, he becomes so thin and so feeble and so,

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:39.840
 so kind of completely skinned, skinned and it's almost like skeletons that we see sometimes

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:44.080
 illustration or the stage of the Buddha of the six years ascetic practices.

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:52.400
 That is why he did that, in order to reach enlightenment, in order to benefit for all living

00:29:52.400 --> 00:30:01.200
 beings, in order to discover that enlightenment within, not looking, try and get up from outside.

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:10.240
 He saw there's no enlightenment going to come from outside. It's subdiscours. Because of that,

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:19.200
 he spent halfway. Because his courage and commitment, endeavor and passion, that truly he become

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:28.880
 the beacon of the peace and harmonious. No, and beacon of the peace and harmony for all living

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:36.960
 beings, not selective guru or human or these and that, the whole living beings. He showed the great

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:45.040
 torch of light, light that everyone's truth natures. How we all share the same nature,

00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:52.560
 same truth, same, doesn't matter whether you are animals, whether you are humans or whatever the

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:58.960
 situation, certain physical forms, whatever you have, the basic grown nature is the same.

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:07.760
 Those are, he lightened up, the never spoke before. All those teachings, that's what the gracious

00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:14.880
 teacher, Buddha Shatyamuni did. And Guru Bhema Sambhava is known as the emanation of the Buddha,

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:20.960
 emanation of the Buddha Amitabha, the living Buddha Amitabha, and a reincarnation of the

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:26.560
 Buddha Shatyamuni that you all, we all know. We all heard that, and we read in the books.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:36.720
 And is it true? That's what every great master says. See, and that even, that way, in this

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:43.120
 eight cemeteries, all different cemeteries he practiced and meditated, he received the teachings

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:48.880
 with joyful respect fully in a contract with the student or masters and received the teachings.

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:56.720
 Humble and a support, same manner of the teacher and the student level. Level, even he's already

00:31:56.720 --> 00:32:02.800
 enlightened, but it's all hardship in the dual journey for the spiritual realizations

00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:12.400
 that's demonstrated for the other, such as us, to practice. This is all important. Done. Done.

00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:16.720
 And then as I said, the great master, in the debate, all those great masters, I mean,

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:23.760
 there's so many numbers you all know, maybe I don't know many of those. And many different,

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:29.760
 those old great masters, really, in the different schools of Buddhists, how much they practice and

00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:38.080
 meditate, they treat that realization we honor, we glorify, we cherish. It's not just a cave by

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:46.480
 itself at that moment, in one time. This is the walk of the joy in the loving kindness compared

00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:53.200
 to the one that discovered that those realizations touch all of them. And they need it to be,

00:32:53.200 --> 00:33:00.400
 for example, life story, malaria. His realization, his hardship, his courage and commitment,

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:08.320
 that's how really he discovered that realization. Because of his joy of effort, his passion,

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:20.080
 that his willingness of the teacher to spend time and effort and all that put down and went to

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:28.720
 mountain to mountain, cave to caves. Those are named as kasas, kasas and all that. He went.

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:36.560
 And then great master, in the teachings, again, same thing. He practiced, even though he is

00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:41.200
 already enlightened, he is highly, highly great. Like he is one of the genius

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:50.400
 balsam or the scholars, one of the great scholars in all times and how much he practiced, how much

00:33:50.400 --> 00:34:00.080
 he really put effort. And that kind of courage and commitment. That shows all this. And in ancient

00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:06.400
 terms, those great masters who were all cheating to debate, those great oscillators, such as Vero

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:13.040
 Jhanas, Namco and Yungko, all that, they went to India at that time. And at that ancient time,

00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:18.800
 India, and of course, the Indian debate is already confused, but yet, every border is kind of quite

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:25.200
 different. Calamity level is very different. Language is very different. Custom is very

00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:30.720
 different. All that. And it's something in that time, ancient time, going even for the kind of

00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:38.000
 200 miles away, everyone thinks it's completely kind of alien country. It's a completely unknown

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:43.760
 state. They have their post hopes. But Vero Jhanas and all that with great compassion,

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:49.360
 great courage went to bring the dharma to the debate back by the witches that are caused by

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:55.840
 the kinds of sometimes. Such all those, they really said hard journey. The call, hard journey,

00:34:55.840 --> 00:35:02.480
 the unknown areas, they went without any maps or without any kind of knowledge too much.

00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:09.920
 And this is, that is not just only in, but also in China, those great masters, particularly

00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:17.360
 that great master Hunsang, who went to India to try to go here as a determined to bring the

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:18.320
 Buddhism

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:25.200
 thought back to China and who went through the same loops that you all know. He wrote beautiful

00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:33.040
 films, guide books of all the way how he went and he explained every detail when he stopped

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:39.120
 our country and all that. So beautiful, really so precise, so clear. And he went

00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:46.960
 and he returned, he bought all those teachings back. He's one of the great translators or masters

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:54.000
 of the China's. I heard that. I mean, this is so many. So these are all unknown areas.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:02.480
 The patience for bringing the dharma or patience for practice dharma. Any increase in realization

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:09.200
 or practice dharma. And that we need. We should not always keep dharma. It's a kind of almost

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:17.040
 border of our list. We try to push that on the front as much as we can and practice with more

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:26.160
 grace, more respect, more this important that. So that is really, that is really about the patience

00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:38.240
 for them. In a debate, chusar kabti is over. So, patience for the self practice of a hard journey

00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:43.920
 of the dharma practices. Even that is always convenience for the samsara activity can be not

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:50.720
 made. But we have to make that one of the biotic and strong practices which is so important.

00:36:50.720 --> 00:37:00.000
 And the next patient is then patient for the protonal meaning of the dharma. And that is,

00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:11.310
 is in a debate, what I say, sammi, kunga, madrapi, zopa. The patient then not scared with the pro

00:37:11.310 --> 00:37:11.840
tonal

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:21.200
 meaning of the teaching of the Buddha. Protonal meaning of the dharma and not scared.

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:29.600
 That is patience. So that means your patience, your courage and commitment, well connected,

00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:39.840
 maintained with practice, not scared, not become timid and give up. Then if we give up,

00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:49.760
 what it is, we become the, we are going to the loser. We are losing our goals and we are losing

00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:58.560
 our promises. We are losing our commitment. When we met commitment, when we took the reference,

00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:06.560
 we met commitment. We took the reference by thoughtfully and we declared mind,

00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:15.200
 nobody pushed us, nobody pushed us. And not just only that, we took the reference,

00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:22.080
 body get among us. Also, we thoughtfully. We said clearly we are going to follow on the,

00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:29.920
 in the footsteps of the Buddha and you all these others. We will do exactly what you did

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:36.960
 to benefit all sentient beings. And now we are lingering it.

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:45.200
 That is in the samsara, not in the spiritual. Even in the samsara, when you say something I will do

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:45.200
,

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:54.080
 if you didn't do, that is very fishy, fishy that considered in the samsara too. Fishy and not what

00:38:54.080 --> 00:39:00.240
 they call slickly, slickly or something. That is really do. It's not just in the samsara now,

00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:06.880
 but that used to be in Asian town too. All countries, standing firm with commitment.

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:14.880
 For that reason, the great master said, the noble person don't make too many commitments.

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:23.200
 But once they made the commitment, stand firmly with that commitment. As the letter curved in

00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:33.910
 stone, even the stone breaks, the lines of letter remains the same way. That is known as honor once

00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:34.400
.

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:42.480
 Considering any standards, it's good. So therefore, we should not be scaled

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:52.720
 with teachings. What are the profound meanings? In the Buddha teaching, there are many teachings

00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:59.680
 that I didn't mention by any other great masters, such as teachings of the interdependent

00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:11.040
 co-ordinations. Interdependent co-ordinations. No teachers in this world said that, Exhaprabuddha,

00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:19.200
 interdependent co-ordinations. Tingyen, Devar, Dhulma. What that means, there is no

00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:25.760
 substantial solid existing anything in the subject level, in the object level.

00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:35.120
 There is no substantial solid existing level, anything. All are formed as cooperatives.

00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:47.200
 What all means? All the particles are formed. The cooperatively connected cooperatively formed

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:57.040
 what we see. Really, really is a heap of the particles. That even particle itself is a one-on-one

00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:07.120
 solid. It has so many sub-particles. Particles. So for that reason, it is all. Therefore, it is

00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:16.720
 changing. It's changing, such as in Parma levels. This is what, again, the great teacher of Buddha

00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:25.760
 said, in Parma levels. This is not Dhulma. This is not just pure. It is. Everything is changing

00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:35.520
 because everything is forming. Everything is changing. Everything is transforming.

00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:44.160
 To tell that Sirulma clearly, what the great teacher said, related truth is all a dream life,

00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:51.680
 magic life, bubble life, reflection moon in the water life.

00:41:51.680 --> 00:42:02.320
 Not many teachers said before like that. This is all. When we heard all this dream life,

00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:08.400
 all this bubble life, all this reflection life, all those image, mirror image life,

00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:14.320
 and we see that. When we heard this, "Oh, how that come? I don't really, I don't so I can

00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:14.880
 understand

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:24.160
 that meanings." Then we become immediately kind of timid, timid. But reality, that is the way.

00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:29.760
 It didn't mean it's not going to function. Everything going to function exactly as it,

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:35.520
 but it means that no substantial soul exists of this relative is all in that.

00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:40.880
 And then, absolutely, what they said is emptiness.

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:50.800
 Emptiness. There's nothing substantially existing. Emptiness. So probably, where,

00:42:50.800 --> 00:43:00.880
 where is the villages arising? Prove that emptiness. In a way, the forming is a cooperative things.

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:07.680
 These all are known as performed meanings. Performed meanings of the teachings.

00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:18.320
 That is what I told, egolessiness. It's true. Again. And we think there is something that

00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:24.960
 exists the egos. There is no such egos. Every single image is getting analyzed with

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:30.560
 analytical ways. Or maybe modern machine is also back to those couple of levels too.

00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:37.600
 And we're trying to find anything that ego. It's nothing. Where we're holding the ego,

00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:43.200
 in the teaching hallways, we hold the ego because of the continuity of these aggregates,

00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:51.200
 and, and as well as there's a combination of the aggregate, then we see what continuity means.

00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:56.960
 Continued from the time we are conserved from the mother's womb, and until now, I mean,

00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:03.280
 until we die, it's continuing something this outer gets. And then these are not just the

00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:11.200
 one is continuity, it's a combination. All the outer gets, all the pieces, but even the particle,

00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:16.720
 what we extracted, the limb, the hand, the finger, and head, and all these things, bone, and

00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:17.280
 muscles,

00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:22.080
 what I mean, it's all corporate. Each of these will look, it's just all so many things,

00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:28.560
 formed. So we kind of, we don't always get it in our life, kind of blindly, we're talking, oh,

00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:35.280
 ah, you owe me like that. Of course, we can name. That is nothing wrong. But there is no

00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:44.080
 substantial solid existence. Ah, all the egos, standing firmly, solid stones. It's not outside

00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:50.240
 of our body, not inside of our body. We, when there's no, I mean, it's nothing really.

00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:54.800
 So those are the profound meaning of the teachings, not scared.

00:44:54.800 --> 00:45:00.560
 Not scared. Then there is a more profound teaching, what is what I talk,

00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:07.120
 such as in the very early teachings, all the five outer gets are five male buddhas,

00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:16.160
 and the five elements are five human buddhas. We don't see that now, right now. No. But that's

00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:25.760
 the religious realities. Buddha said what? Said, when will we pull out, or when we pull out our

00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:33.840
 cataracts of the dualities, dualities, that moment we begin to see that everything is enlightened

00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:42.560
 status. Until that we won't see, but every again, begin to scale with that. Oh, how that can come,

00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:48.000
 how that can be my body. All the aggregates are like buddhas and all these things kind of,

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:53.920
 we have big notions of the between Buddha and ourself, but such as like, kind of almost like

00:45:53.920 --> 00:46:00.960
 skies in the dome to the earth, attitude, or the blue sky up in these many hundred thousand

00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:08.800
 miles away in the dome that, but reality is within all the same, is only the discovery that.

00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:16.640
 So those are known as profound meanings, not scared with the profound meaning of the teaching

00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:24.000
 and the observing and and actualizing it. And of course, you can always get analyzed.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:32.800
 That religious teacher, Buddha himself said, said, you can always get analyzed. You should analyze

00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:41.200
 that. You can analyze all that, study and align the meditative practices. So those are known as

00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:51.120
 very briefly about the patient for the profound meaning of the, the dance. And that is then

00:46:51.120 --> 00:47:00.000
 the kind of pretty much we got with the, with the meaning of the patient, patient parabhadhas,

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:09.200
 chant parabhadhas. How to increase the patient parabhadam in a teaching said, then to activate it

00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:17.920
 more, wishing both each other, whole, boneless, whole, boneless practices, and do the meditations

00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:26.560
 as much as you can meditate. And in the end, do the aspiration and dedication prayers. Each time

00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:32.720
 when you're able to do the patient practices, as we went those one after another, immediately when

00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:39.760
 you recognize, able to, to recognize and do the patient practices, the parabhadam practices,

00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:46.080
 immediately kind of dedicated that merit and wish that to benefit all the sentient beings.

00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:52.240
 And also by the blessings of the Buddha's, the bodhisattva, may I perform the patient parabhadam

00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:58.080
 practices, completely performed, parabhadam performed. And whatever the merit is, I dedicated

00:47:58.080 --> 00:48:03.520
 that for all sentient beings. May I become the one of the great, like may I become the one of the

00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:10.880
 great bodhisattvas, such as like Mejushiri, Vaitya Pani, Terezi, the Arya Mejira, all those like

00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:11.040
 that,

00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:17.840
 bodhisattva, really praying those things. Always in the teaching said it will increase and activate

00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:23.280
 any parabhadas. Whatever you pray for that, it will help with that. So that is my brief talk

00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:28.880
 for today. And thank you again. Thank you. We completed our patient parabhadam practices,

00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:35.920
 which is very tough and very important. It is really like, as, like, as I said, is backbone

00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:42.400
 of the old parabhadam practices. And so thank you again for very much. And then we continue

00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:57.600
 tomorrow. Thank you again for your participation. And again, thank you.
