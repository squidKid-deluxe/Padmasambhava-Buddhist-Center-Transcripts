NOTE     "synopsis": "Announcing the Publication of \"The Seven Nails: The Final Testament of the Great Dzogchen Master Shri Singha\"\nby Ven. Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche\nand Ven. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche\n\nOrder on Ven. Khenpo Rinpoches' PBC Pemai Chiso website: www.padmasambhava.org/chiso/books-by-khenpo-rinpoches/the-seven-nails-the-final-testament-of-the-great-dzogchen-master-shri-singha\n\nThe realization of Dzogchen is not achieved through studying, analysis, and intellectual understanding only. According to the teaching, the perfect meaning of Dzogchen comes from introduction, meditation, devotion, and receiving the lineage blessings. With these methods, we can discover the Great Perfection within ourselves because self-discovery is the Dzogchen way. If you follow any methods other than those, you are looking in the wrong direction.\n\nAt the same time, we should also engage in good activities that will benefit others, as well as ourselves. In the Buddha\u2019s teaching, the two aspects of the path are known as \u201caccumulating the two merits:\u201d (1) the accumulation merit of compassionate activities, and (2) the wisdom merit achieved through skillful meditation. Throughout the Mahayana and Vajrayana teachings, the Buddha mentioned that these two accumulations are necessary. And it\u2019s not that the Buddha is just creating some program or rules that we have to follow, but this is the nature. If we would like to discover the nature\u2018s beauty, we have to follow a natural path.\n\nIn general, \u201cpracticing the Dharma\u201d means absorbing the Dharma into our hearts and minds. This also means that Dharma is not outside ourselves, or something we look at just once in a while. The Dharma must be constantly activated in our hearts and minds. Similarly, Dzogchen must be maintained in our hearts and minds with devotion and confidence. This is how we practice the Dharma.\n\nDharma Samudra\n191 Pages\nSize: 6 x 9\n\nISBN: 9780983407478",
