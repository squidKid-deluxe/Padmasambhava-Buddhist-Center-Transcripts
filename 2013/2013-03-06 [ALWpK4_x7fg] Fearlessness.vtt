00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 Fearlessness, fearlessness, fearlessness.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 Have we been timid? Have we been hesitant?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 Doubt and hesitating all this, this is called weakness.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 It's timid.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 That means what is happening?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 We are over powered by again, same thing, the ego, the habit pattern.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 Habit pattern, ego.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 This habit pattern, ego is very, very manipulative.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 It's manipulating us all the time, many different ways.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 Very roughly, very sniggly, sniggly, sniggly,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 and very naively, very innocent way.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 I mean, all different ways is really, it is manipulative.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 And what it's doing, result is what?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 Then it blocks, and then we just like to keep us on the ego world.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 Like to keep us in the duality world.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 It like to be ruled by all the emotions,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 such as ignorance, attachment, and jealous, hated.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 All those are coming one after another, and then ego is fine.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 But when we begin to do this practice, the palace, the egolessness,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 egolessness and great emptiness, great love, great compassion,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 great wisdom that has not discriminated,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 when we begin to do this openness practice,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 there is so many things come, these egos.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 For that reason, Buddha taught,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 the Gharbhema Samba taught, always teaching,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 be strong, be confident, joy and happy.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 No matter whatever that, you continue to move forward.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 Then we are on the beautiful state of that.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 All the turbulence goes there,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 and we will be continuing on the beautiful sunlight state.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 Even we stay on that, turbulence comes out,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 and all that, because these habit patterns,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 these habit patterns is not just we do love, since we born.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 This is carrying, carrying packages

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 that start from the biggest time of our lives.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 We carry that package all the time, until now.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 Today we are crumbling.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 Today we are shaking that, that carrying package.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 We are crumbling, right?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 Cumbling.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 Today we are cumbling.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 Today we are shaking that.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 Today we are knocking them, that.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 It's a wonderful time, it's a beautiful time.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 We are making beauty ourselves,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 we are making beauty for other beings,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 that we can benefit for all beings,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 because what is coming up, as we said.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 Then all the beautiful qualities.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 This is the next sentence in the teaching set.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 All these wondrous qualities,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 bhema ke sa dung bhula,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 yang sin chogam nudam.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 That next sentence,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 yang sin chogam nudam.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 Supreme wondrous qualities that you achieve.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 Supreme wondrous, beautiful achievement is arising, is coming.
