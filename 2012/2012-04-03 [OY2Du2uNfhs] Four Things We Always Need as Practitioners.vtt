00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.620
 At the samsara level, we have quite okay, you have quite okay. Therefore, what is weak is joy in

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.740
 appreciation, graceful.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:19.890
 That is, therefore, particularly this time we came here, you come so grateful and practice, we

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.960
 should really ignite that joy, graceful.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:31.670
 This is practice also one way, we came to celebrate our good qualities and revere that more.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:38.440
 Therefore, joy in appreciation, graceful, is very important.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:47.540
 Second, as he said, joyful effort, that is what we are doing. Joyful effort, along with that one,

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:56.000
 courage and commitment and confidence, all that combined together with this joyful effort, effort

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:04.430
 we should, this is visible time, right time, right moment, all things we should take the

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.260
 opportunities.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:13.800
 Great, joyful effort, courage, commitment and confidence.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:36.940
 Then third, as he said, thoughtful, thoughtful comes along with me, you heard many times from me

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:37.170
 and the candy butter gentleman, mindfulness, aliveness, cautiousness, all thoughtful, thoughtful of

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.060
 our work, of our body, action of our body.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:50.700
 Action of our speech, action of our mind. Be let be taught. When you are taught for that, when it

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.460
 comes, then we will play like status, not stay all the time in the dark.

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:06.190
 If we combine the thoughtful, joyful effort and joy, it is something so special, so beautiful. With

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:15.860
 this, the fourth one is what? Then, let's say attachment, trying not to cling, grasp.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:23.980
 That means what? Again, open heart and open mind, more relaxed, calm, you couldn't so much

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:32.460
 peacefully kind of attach it. It leads so many things, let it come, let it go, what all those?

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:38.670
 That is all the contracts of this last detachment. Those are the great masters. Said and those are

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.110
 the teaching what we are going to learn from him. So with that contracts, then you already know a

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.460
 lot of the practice men trying to meditate in the practice and use this term as meaningful,

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.860
 something spiritual in this beautiful setting.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:58.320
 One of the, I said, in kenki parti, always, many other great masters who visited, oh, this is

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:06.760
 really one of the best places that we can go to the places, go to the practice meditate, go to med

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.260
itate, go to practice, this is one of the best on this planet.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:18.410
 And we have all these opportunities, all good things. So they ever kind of take this opportunity

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:25.730
 and this is a remember, time to celebrate our good things of the past, trying to stand firm on that

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.860
 and looking beautiful horizon for the future, for very nice things.

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:39.570
 So those are, I guess, the thought to tell what I learned from all those other teachers. Okay? So

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:44.880
 we'll stop there. Thank you. Thank you very much, everyone. And then I'm sure you have some

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.660
 questions that we'll talk tomorrow.

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:07.860
 Thank you.
