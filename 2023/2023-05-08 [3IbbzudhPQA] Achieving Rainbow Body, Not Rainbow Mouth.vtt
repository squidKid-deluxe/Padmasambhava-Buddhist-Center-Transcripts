00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.720
 "This is a realization, this is booming. Not just talking, saying things. Those who are saying

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:13.480
 things of this ruse and Dzogchen teaching, not practicing, those who are the great master of

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.000
 popular music, named Renbo Mouths."

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 Only Renbo actually have to become the Renbo Body, not just Renbo Mouth, but Rainbow Mouth.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 Renbo Mouth is when the crucial time comes, won't help. It won't help. Is it Renbo? Renbo's gone?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 Gone.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.680
 Crucial times, that is, even during our lifetime, there is such a raging emotions coming. Different

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.000
 things, we completely become only a person, un-practitioners.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:52.580
 Our emotions are so strong, dense and glashing that. But good pre-practitioners, when the emotion

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:58.000
 comes, even they are not talking all the time, they are able to liberate it.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 Those are known as sign of the pre-practitioners, not just liberate with love and compassion.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:14.570
 Increasing that, when you are able to see that liberated, that in many times the teaching says, "As

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.000
 much as your emotions, that much you have the worst of us."

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:26.560
 Those who have power abilities, who handle them, that is the worst of us. More emotions, more worst

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.000
 of us in the teaching.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:37.580
 But for us at the beginning time, that's not the case. We have to be very careful with thought

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:43.000
 force, with mindfulness, with alertness, with cautiousness. All that really need it.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:55.230
 Now, the will is like mountain-like will. Our will is strong at mountain-like step, as you said,

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.000
 already explained.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:07.400
 Now, the second is meditation, ocean-like meditations, ocean-like abiding meditation, or ocean-like

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.000
 meditation.
