00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 As always, welcome, welcome, welcome, and as is, one voice with the lineage of our precious

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 teachers,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:24.040
 before any study, contemplation, practice, really connecting with the three motivations.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:34.760
 So all just taking, why? Because that's the entirety of our practice, connecting with our joy, our

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.040
 appreciation,

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:44.430
 our contentment, our trust in the true nature and our very, very, very fortunate, precious

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.040
 situation.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:56.630
 And gendering, nurturing, growing, expanding our Bodhichitta, and the motivation that this time

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:57.040
 together,

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:04.370
 and everything we can do, is nothing but boundless benefit for countless beings in this world and

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:05.040
 beyond,

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:12.580
 throughout all time and space. And then as much as we can too, connecting with our, again, our

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:13.040
 devotion,

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:25.040
 with the purity view of just how truly pristine and perfect this moment is, and expanding our

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.040
 vision,

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:33.040
 and dropping our mundane conceptions, and boring habits we've been dragging from countless times,

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:40.280
 and kind of relax in the beautiful view we're being introduced to. So we'll just take a few moments

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.040
 with that.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:02:09.040
 [Silence]

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:16.190
 So we always take a little bit before we do our practice, and just reflect on different parts of

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.040
 the practice,

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:24.030
 and things that might be of help for just deepening and strengthening our practice, both formally

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.040
 and unformally,

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:34.240
 with our main meditation, as well as post-meditation. And so, I think it's been, this would be the

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.040
 third week,

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:43.030
 where a few people had asked about the mandala offering, and so I thought what we'll do first is

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040
 just go over

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:49.040
 the mandala offering a little bit, and then if there's time, we can kind of continue a little bit

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:57.770
 with just reflecting on the three jewels, the three roots, in regard to the refuge section of our

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.040
 practice.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:05.040
 And so of course, there's so many beautiful instructions, and then in Kempo Rinpoche's book,

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:11.040
 Illuminating the Path, there's actually pretty detailed, concise but detailed instructions

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:21.040
 on doing the practice, and the meaning of the practice, but we can go over that a little bit now.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:30.040
 So you know, what is the mandala? The mandala is the whole sphere of purity.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:42.860
 You know, what's perfect, and clear, and spacious, kind of instead of a confused chaos, like what

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.040
 is this?

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:52.650
 The nature as it is, shining forth brilliantly. So the mandala, in that sense of that, is a whole

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:53.040
 sphere

00:03:53.040 --> 00:04:04.040
 of enlightened activity and realization, and in essence, it's a way of symbolically representing

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:14.040
 everything that exists, be it on the existing to our mundane, you know, ordinary conception,

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:23.040
 and then also all that as things are in the true nature state, the pure relative truth.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:35.530
 So the whole of everything, both in the kind of impure relative truth, as well as the pure relative

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.040
 truth,

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:45.040
 and of course the nature of both of those is the absolute truth of the great emptiness

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:54.040
 and indivisible with that, the great clarity, so that wisdom and compassion growing.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:59.040
 And then with our mandala practice, and in fact every part of our nundra,

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:09.040
 we have what's called the mandala of the absolute mandala of realization,

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:15.040
 the mandala that is our objects of refuge. So in that sense, it's here being embodied

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:23.040
 as Guru Padmasambhava, right, and all the refuge tree, embodiment of all the three jewels,

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:30.040
 the three roots, the Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, Guru, Devas, Dakinis, Dharmapalas,

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:39.570
 all the infinite realms of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas and Dakinis, Dharmapalas and lightened

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:40.040
 activities,

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:48.040
 in essence the realization of things as it is and the true nature as it is,

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:59.370
 and those who've realized it have perfected the path, or are well on the way in the Bhumis and

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:00.040
 things,

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:11.040
 and so we are connecting with that in our practice, and so as part of that,

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:16.040
 then we're making the mandala offering, like it says in the book here,

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:26.040
 is it the accumulation of merit. So in our path for ourselves, in our path of realization,

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:31.040
 in our path of exploring the nature, there's two main things we're doing,

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:37.040
 which we hear again and again, accumulating merit, accumulating wisdom,

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:44.040
 and so this section of the nundra practice, which is the mandala offering,

00:06:44.040 --> 00:07:01.040
 is this very powerful, so simple but profound practice of accumulating merit and wisdom,

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:09.040
 and then as aspiring Bodhisattvas, we're doing what's called actualizing our bodhicitta,

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:15.040
 and I think we've all heard too, the paramitas, the six paramitas,

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:21.040
 is another way of framing the accumulation of merit and wisdom,

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:33.040
 the practices that truly purify and awaken our pure potential to really actualize our bodhicitta,

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:38.040
 and that all begins one way with the generosity practice,

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:44.040
 and so the mandala offering is a big generosity practice,

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:51.040
 but it's also, you know, we're getting things together, we're making the time,

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:57.040
 we're gathering materials, we're doing the practice with our motivation,

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:07.590
 and that's also the morality practice, and we're doing that with our patience and joyful effort,

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:09.040
 concentration,

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:16.040
 and then as we're doing that, developing more and more familiarity with the nature as it is,

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:23.040
 which is developing our wisdom, they go hand in hand, like two wings, they say in the teachings,

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:33.040
 developing wisdom and compassion through the practice of accumulating merit and wisdom,

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:55.040
 and so I'll just find the page here, it's on, yeah, page 31.

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:59.040
 So of course, in a profound way, we talk a little of the meaning,

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:07.040
 but I think most people's questions are about how to actually do the physical mandala offering,

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:15.030
 and again, just looking here at the text itself, right, we have the bodies, enjoyments, possessions

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:15.040
,

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:22.030
 and glories of the succession of all my lifetimes I offer to the three jewels in order to complete

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:24.040
 the two accumulations

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:35.630
 of merit and wisdom united, you know, and we can't, they go hand in hand, they totally support each

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:37.040
 other,

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:42.040
 and it's actually just like referring again to our bodhicitta practice,

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:55.040
 it's that as we develop our wisdom that truly makes the paramitas transcendental or paramitas,

00:09:55.040 --> 00:10:03.040
 and so we have the skillful means here, and like I mentioned earlier, we're offering everything,

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:10.680
 we have the mudra, and I brought some of the materials to show the, you know, if you have the mand

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:11.040
ala plate,

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:19.040
 you can do that, but we're doing exactly that, we're using our imagination, connecting with our joy

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:26.370
 and devotion and true, like just vast appreciation, the more we kind of really contemplate the

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:27.040
 Buddha,

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:35.560
 the Dharma, the Sangha, the nature of the Guru, the nature of the deities, the nature of the Dak

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:36.040
inis,

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:42.880
 you know, the more we explore the Dharma in practice, the more our joy and our appreciation can

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:44.040
 grow,

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:50.160
 and so this is like within this formal practice, we're doing exactly that, we're offering

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:54.040
 everything to the ultimate goodness,

00:10:54.040 --> 00:11:00.040
 so that's both just connecting with that beautiful motivation we have,

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:05.390
 and then if we kind of think about it, how far reaching that goes, and how much that really is not

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:06.040
 just about

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:13.690
 something we're doing for however long on our cushion, but really thinking about what we're saying

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:14.040
 here,

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:21.200
 that all the bodies will ever inhabit, all the lives we ever have, you know, all the possessions we

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.040
 ever have,

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:31.050
 all the capabilities we ever develop, all the knowledge we gain, you know, all the fulfillments and

00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:32.040
 success

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:39.040
 and positive growth we have in this life, in all our lives, where we offer to the ultimate goodness

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:47.040
 and the glorification of the true nature shining forth for ourselves and others, you know,

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:55.040
 that's truly what mandala offering is, it's connecting everything with our practice

00:11:55.040 --> 00:12:05.590
 and trying to keep in mind everything that we're doing has that bodhicitta motivation and kind of

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:08.040
 doing it,

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:18.590
 and so maybe I'll get to the actual mandala part itself, so we're going to move the camera around a

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:21.040
 little bit,

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:28.040
 so there's a few things that's good to have when you do the actual mandala plate,

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:36.640
 I'm sure people have seen, but we have many, there's some mandalas that then also have this base

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:37.040
 plate

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:42.040
 and then have three rings and then a little ornament that goes on top

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:48.490
 and that, of course, all these can be both, like I said, the kind of the absolute mandala as well

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:50.040
 as the offering mandala,

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:54.620
 when it's the offering mandala, then sometimes when those rings are used might be in other

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:58.040
 practices like for the 37 point offering,

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:07.040
 but here in the dojum turso non drow it's more simple, it's just to have this one base plate,

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:13.040
 and so and then we're making, in a way, seven point or five point offering here,

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:20.040
 so if you have one of these, like we have them in our chiso shop and they're available to get,

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:26.040
 or if you don't have that you can have any other kind of object that's good, nice flat,

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:35.040
 it's a little rounded, but this, so there's this, and then it's good, usually when you're making

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:35.040
 the offering

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:45.040
 you have many objects that we're offering, right, so the most simple is if you get some rice,

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:51.040
 you can get some rice that's fresh and especially for your mandala practice,

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:57.040
 and if you have the means you could get some saffron water and brew the saffron water

00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:04.370
 and then rinse and wash the rice in that and then lay it out, let it dry like on a towel or a

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:05.040
 screen,

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:13.030
 and then once it's dry then put it in a nice container, you can do that, also if you have the means

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:14.040
 and you want to,

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:21.040
 you can also get other kinds of grains, you know, different colored rice, different colored beans,

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:28.040
 you know, different spices or things like that that you can to kind of make the offering more rich,

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:35.040
 and then again according to your capabilities also sometimes people get like tumbled stones

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:43.560
 and semi-precious jewels, all according to your capacities, you can include diamonds, rubies, emer

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:46.040
alds, gold dust, silver dust,

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:56.590
 you know, all sort of things, but for most of us I think keeping on the simple side is more an art

00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:57.040
 means,

00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:05.880
 but so the point is it's an offering and according to your means making it nice, but here we just

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:07.040
 have rice,

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:13.040
 again you want to keep that in a clean container that's just for the practice,

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:19.370
 and the other part to have is then if you have some sort of a cloth, like this is actually maybe a

00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:22.040
 little small but I grabbed it,

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:30.280
 and that's because I think if you've ever done this it can be very explosive in little rice going

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:32.040
 all over the place and stones,

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:40.040
 so having something that can help catch the rice and you can put in your lap is good.

00:15:40.040 --> 00:16:00.040
 So how should we do this? Should I move, or you can see this really? Right.

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:10.040
 Let's see, I'll just move this a little bit.

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:22.040
 What I'll do is, I'll just do it so bear with me, we'll figure it out a few ways.

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:36.040
 So ordinarily I put this in my lap, I guess.

00:16:53.040 --> 00:17:00.040
 So if you have a cloth, can you see me off?

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:05.040
 And if anybody has a question or something I'm forgetting, tell me.

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:13.040
 So you have your plate, you have your offerings, you can just put in your cloth,

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:24.310
 and then also if you can make a little bit of saffron water to have, to cleanse the plate in the

00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:25.040
 very beginning,

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:33.430
 that's nice to do, or if you don't have saffron, just have some fresh spring water, that can be

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:36.040
 nice too.

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:44.040
 And so, again, this is the outer mechanical part of what we're doing,

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:50.040
 and of course connecting with the meaning and motivation is the really important thing,

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:53.040
 but then having the form is nice.

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:59.040
 So when you have the cloth, sometimes you can even, if you're somewhere,

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:03.040
 you can kind of have this be a little bit of a bowl in your lap,

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:08.040
 or a bigger cloth that can help catch things is really good.

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:12.040
 And then what we're doing, right, just like with our mudra,

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:19.040
 we have these five points according to the Abhidhammas of Buddha Shakyamuni,

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:27.420
 the way of describing the whole universe was Mount Meru and the Four Continents, the Sun and the

00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:28.040
 Moon.

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:37.040
 So that's like the whole infinitude of all existence, you know, Mount Meru and the Four Continents,

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:44.040
 and then the Sun and the Moon, so we're essentially redoing that with the plate.

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:48.040
 And so to start, we have the foundation, the base,

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:53.040
 one way we could think this is just like the basic space of our awareness.

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:57.040
 And then that's why in the very beginning, you just need to do it in the beginning,

00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:04.040
 if you take a little bit of the saffron water and put it on the plate, kind of to anoint it,

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:13.260
 and then just cleanse the mirror of the surface of that, kind of just expand our awareness of the

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:14.040
 true nature,

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:21.040
 the great openness, great emptiness out of which everything's arising and inseparable.

00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:27.040
 And then you have your grains, and then what we're doing is, I'll point here,

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:36.040
 when we have the mandala of our practice, if we are supplicating the objects of refuge,

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:46.590
 then as far as the mandala, right, that would have the center, the east, the south, the west, the

00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:48.040
 north,

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:51.040
 that basic part of the directions.

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:59.040
 Like as we're doing our mandala practice, even if it's not geographically, geologically how we are,

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:06.040
 within the mandala of our practice, we're facing Gurumpushe in the mandala.

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:14.040
 He's to our west, so we're in the east, Gurumpushe is to the west of us, before us.

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:23.770
 That's the inner kind of geomancy of our practice, in the sacred mandala of everything is contained

00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:24.040
, right?

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:31.240
 And so then with the mandala, what we're doing is, I'm going to tilt it, but so say the

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:34.040
 practitioner is here in the east,

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:41.040
 and so again, if we're tilting, looking from above, that means we have the center, Mount Meru,

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:50.050
 and then the east, the south, the west, the north, and so that would be Mount Meru in the four

00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:51.040
 continents,

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:56.040
 and then we also have the addition of the sun and the moon.

00:20:56.040 --> 00:21:06.040
 So we have these seven points, center, east, south, west, north, the sun and the moon.

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:13.040
 One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:21.040
 And there's a diagram of this also in the mandala section in Gurumpushe's book, so that's there.

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:27.040
 And then when we're doing the offering, again, keeping the visualization and the motivation,

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:33.380
 and these simple words, the bodies, enjoyments, possessions and glories, the succession of all my

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:34.040
 lifetimes,

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:38.040
 they offer to the three jewels in order to complete the two accumulations.

00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:48.040
 So we're doing that, and as we're doing that, we're just putting, making these seven little piles

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:50.040
 and offering it.

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:57.040
 And then as you offer, you bring it up, and then Kenchen, Paul, and Rinpoche always made the point,

00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:02.040
 let the offerings tilt the plate towards you, and the offerings kind of fall.

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:08.450
 And then again, the bodies, enjoyments, possessions and glories of the succession of all my lif

00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:09.040
etimes,

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:15.040
 I offer to the three jewels in order to complete the two accumulations.

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:20.040
 The bodies, enjoyments, possessions and glories of the succession of all my lifetimes,

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:25.040
 I offer to the three jewels in order to complete the two accumulations.

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:35.040
 And connecting with that motivation, and don't worry, I think you'll notice the piles spread.

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:42.040
 You know, don't worry if you're, if the pile like falls out, just be clear about your placement,

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:47.040
 and your visualization and what you're doing, and just keep offering, keep going.

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:52.040
 That's what we're doing, just offering, offering, offering everything,

00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:56.040
 really, really reflecting on the meaning of what we're saying,

00:22:56.040 --> 00:23:04.800
 and using our imagination to really kind of engender and fill this really simple form of the

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:08.040
 practice we're doing.

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:16.040
 And you just keep doing that for as long as that part of your practice session is.

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:22.040
 And something when you do get to the point in your practice when you're doing accumulating,

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:30.670
 and really keeping track of each mandala offering, counting as one, there's many ways to do a thing

00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:31.040
.

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:40.490
 So, something that I found helpful after trying a few different things, where I, for myself, could

00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:46.040
 just really focus on the meditation and the practice,

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:53.400
 was if I had a little tally counter, you know, they have them little, some are mechanical, some are

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:54.040
 electronic,

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:59.560
 but just a little simple thing you can hold in your hand, and you just push the tab on it, and it

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:01.040
 advances one.

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:10.470
 So if you're using that, you can actually kind of hold it underneath, sorry I don't have one right

00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:11.040
 now,

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:18.030
 but you can hold it underneath, and then as you do the practice, the bodies, enjoyments,

00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:19.040
 possessions,

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:23.040
 enjoyments, and glories is a session of all my lifetimes.

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:27.040
 I offer to the three jewels in order to complete the two accumulations.

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:34.040
 And then once you do one, you can just click it with your hand, and then there it is.

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:40.360
 And have whatever, just like with all our accumulations, how you, when you're doing that part of

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:41.040
 your practice,

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:47.490
 if your mandala offering is a main practice, you see, like, how you'd want to do that. If you're

00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:49.040
 doing it, oh, I'm going to do one mala,

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:55.040
 then, you know, look and see when you've done, you know, at least 108.

00:24:55.040 --> 00:25:02.030
 Or if you're going by time, oh, I'm going to do my mandala offering for 20 minutes, or half hour,

00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:03.040
 or however long,

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:08.630
 then just know that, and then you look at the tally counter, and you see what you've done, record

00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:09.040
 that,

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:12.040
 and continue with your other practices.

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:18.040
 And then, of course, there's other ways, too, if you have a mala, or you can all play with it, too,

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:24.740
 but I found that they're easy to get, and they're also good for when you're doing prostrations and

00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:28.040
 other things.

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:33.040
 Yeah, so I hope that's helpful.

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:38.330
 Is there anybody? I know, I wish everyone was here, and there's a way we could actually hear you

00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:39.040
 out there,

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:44.040
 but anyone who's actually in the room have a question, or a point? Yeah?

00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:49.040
 Do you count the Tibetan repetition, or the English? Or it doesn't matter?

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:56.040
 You count either one. Count whatever, if you're saying it in Tibetan, then count that.

00:25:56.040 --> 00:26:03.040
 If you say it in English, count that. They're both good.

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:08.040
 When you're concluding the mandala section, what do you do with the play?

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:16.040
 Okay. Well, usually, like when you have the offering, what I do is, because here we have mice,

00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:24.040
 and we're trying not to feed the mice or the other animals, so at least our offerings.

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:34.040
 Yeah. Usually you just finish, and really, again, kind of you can slow down, offer,

00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:42.040
 and then, you know, if you have time, if you have it all dedicated, you can just wrap it all up.

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:55.040
 Like here, I have the rice in the plate, and I can just really wrap it up, and keep it safe,

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:58.040
 and then the inside of the bowl kind of holds the rice.

00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:08.040
 Or if you have a container, you can put it in that. I think keep it simple and practical,

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:13.680
 and then keep that in a special place. You know, if you put it on your shrine or with your puja

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:14.040
 table,

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:22.040
 you can do that. Again, I'll say too, you'll see as you go, if you're using grains

00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:26.040
 or other things that are a little softer, they will over time start to fall apart.

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:33.040
 So maybe every month or something, you can just scatter the grains or things out,

00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:40.040
 you know, for the animals to have outside, and then just start a new rice or whatever you're using.

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:46.040
 Or likewise, if you have other things mixed in, you just deal with it, with however you have it,

00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:51.040
 but just try to keep it fresh and clean and nice.

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:57.040
 And then after, just like with all our sections, if you have time, when you finish offering up

00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:05.040
 with all of our imagination, our joy, our bodhicitta, devotion, commitment,

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:12.040
 then really make that big mandala offering of just letting everything go

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:21.040
 and just resting again in a way in that basic space of awareness, which everything is.

00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:27.800
 And like Rinpoche so beautifully say in the text, you know, we have, again, we're accumulating

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:28.040
 merit

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:35.040
 and wisdom as like the mirror and everything that's appearing in it, they're inseparable.

00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:43.040
 So by just resting our awareness at the end of the mandala offering to, resting in rikpa,

00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:47.040
 resting in our awareness for as long as we have a little time,

00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:51.040
 and then moving on to the other sections of the mandala.

00:28:51.040 --> 00:29:01.040
 So I hope that's helpful, and maybe by saying a little bit, then people can write,

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:04.040
 or if they have more question about that or something.

00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:06.040
 I have another question, maybe you went over it before.

00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:12.040
 So say someone's focusing on the accumulation of mandala, like when they do a session,

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:17.040
 how do they jump right to that section, or do they go through other prayers,

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:21.040
 or kind of will you talk about how you would do the full session?

00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:27.040
 So right, so we'll use this, since we're talking about mandala, we'll use that as an example.

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:37.010
 So, traditionally, when we're doing our accumulation, we're focusing on this, you know, one section

00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:37.040
.

00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:42.040
 But that means we don't leave all the other sections away.

00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:49.040
 So at least once a day, say in the morning, you'll go through your whole nundra cycle

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:52.040
 and spend some time in each section.

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:56.850
 But when we're doing our accumulation, that just means when we get to the point of, say, the mand

00:29:56.850 --> 00:29:58.040
ala,

00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:07.570
 maybe we're familiar enough with the practice that we can say, okay, I'm going to do one mala of

00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:08.040
 mandala offerings,

00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:15.040
 or I'm going to do mandala offerings for 20 minutes of the hour or hour and a half,

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:19.040
 however long you have for your practice.

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:25.370
 And then you can finish that, and then when you finish the mandala section, then you move on to the

00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:26.040
 others.

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:34.040
 So in other words, just like always, begin the practice, opening prayers, lineage prayers,

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:40.040
 if you have time and want to recite calling the lama from afar, you can do that.

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:46.040
 But then definitely go through then the main nundra, the outer nundra, with the four thoughts that

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:46.040
 turn the mind,

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:52.040
 the inner nundra, doing refuge, bodhicitta, and then again.

00:30:52.040 --> 00:31:00.040
 So say you would recite the four thoughts that turn the mind to the dharma.

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:07.040
 Say you recite that three times, and then you get to refuge, you recite that.

00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:14.150
 This is an example. I'm not laying down the law of the only way to do this, but to give some

00:31:14.150 --> 00:31:15.040
 context.

00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:21.550
 Say you're reciting three times each section, three times reflecting on the meaning of the four

00:31:21.550 --> 00:31:24.040
 thoughts that turn the mind,

00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:32.040
 reciting with real connecting with the meaning, with the refuge prayer, with prostrations,

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:39.040
 and then going to bodhicitta for, say, three times connecting with the meaning.

00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:44.900
 And then you get to the bodhicitta section, and then you recite that and really just spend more

00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:48.040
 time in the container of your practice

00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:52.040
 to do that for however long you know you have to do it.

00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:59.040
 But so that you can do it and then finish that section, relax, and then move on.

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:06.030
 Write the next section, Vajrasattva, for however, say, three times, and then go to the Guru Yoga

00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:09.040
 and Amitabha and the final dedication.

00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:15.500
 And if you have time to do a longer, you know, silent meditation, do that, and then make sure to

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:17.040
 dedicate the merit.

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:23.730
 So at least one time go through the whole cycle and then have the accumulation part be the larger

00:32:23.730 --> 00:32:25.040
 portion of the practice,

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:33.040
 but touch all of the other sections for us as long as your time allows and dedicate the merit.

00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:38.200
 And then definitely, Brimpoche has made it clear, if you're doing accumulation and you have time at

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:40.040
 another point in the day,

00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:49.050
 then you can kind of make it a little more concise and open, say, seven line prayer that you recite

00:32:49.050 --> 00:32:54.040
 really with your joy and devotion, refuge, bodhicitta.

00:32:54.040 --> 00:33:04.580
 And then you can go right to the mandala offering and then kind of let that dissolve and rest in

00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:07.040
 your awareness and dedicate the merit.

00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:12.560
 So you can also do that, but the point is make sure to go through the whole nundra practice at

00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:14.040
 least once in a day.

00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:19.770
 If you have time to go through it all, then that's great. It really is so concise. It doesn't take

00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:21.040
 a whole long time to do.

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:26.330
 But again, everyone has different circumstances, and I think the main thing is to really be

00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:29.040
 familiar with our rhythms

00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:35.290
 and be familiar with the practice so we kind of have a sense of our pacing and what's a really

00:33:35.290 --> 00:33:39.040
 practical expectation we can set for ourself

00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:45.040
 and goal we can set for ourself with our practice so that it doesn't become a burden, you know.

00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:53.060
 But it's actually a beautiful kind of goal we can set and fulfill every day, you know, so make it

00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:55.040
 really attainable.

00:33:55.040 --> 00:34:02.300
 And then if we have more time to do more, that's great and wonderful, but to really set goals that

00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:07.040
 we can attain so beautiful and practical and sensible.

00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:11.040
 So that's that. Yes?

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:16.040
 Could you also give an example of, in addition to visualizing the refuge field, the refuge tree,

00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:20.040
 what else might you visualize while you're doing the dull offering?

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:22.040
 As the offering?

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:26.040
 Well, what else might you?

00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:36.110
 Well, you can just think how everything we're doing in this life be of benefit to the three jewels,

00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:37.040
 and you know what that means.

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:42.040
 It means it's benefiting everyone.

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:50.560
 You know, we can imagine we're offering the universe, we're offering bodies, we can emanate many

00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:58.040
 different bodies of all kinds, all genders, all forms, all colors.

00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:05.290
 We can emanate, you know, we use our imagination, offer everything natural, mountains, lakes, or

00:35:05.290 --> 00:35:11.020
 just like if you look at the 37 point offering, you know, offering all these beautiful qualities

00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:16.040
 and substances and wish-fulfilling trees and wish-fulfilling jewels

00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:29.170
 and pure medicines and, you know, just whole worlds and universes and pure lands of, really, I

00:35:29.170 --> 00:35:36.450
 think our imagination is the only limit as far as what we can offer, as well as our motivations,

00:35:36.450 --> 00:35:37.040
 you know.

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:48.310
 So I think, yeah, really practicing our imagination and our aspirations, the way our imagination

00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:55.620
 can kind of, what in our imagination can help fulfill and expand and ignite in a way, kind of our

00:35:55.620 --> 00:36:01.040
 joy and our devotion and bodhicitta.

00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:10.590
 So I hope that's helpful, and now we're definitely kind of going a little over, so thanks for your

00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:15.040
 patience, and we'll do our practice now.

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:44.040
 Thank you.

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:56.210
 And I'll say too, with the mandala offering, it's really connecting with these basic instructions,

00:36:56.210 --> 00:37:04.040
 especially like Rinpoche's instructions, and it's so good, and these are, you know, the practices,

00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:07.040
 the enlightened ones that given us, it's truly is skillful means.

00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:19.210
 So every little thing I think that we encounter with the practice is really meaningful, including,

00:37:19.210 --> 00:37:26.180
 like, trying to make the piles, and they're not staying perfect and overflowing, so keeping it

00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:27.040
 going.

00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:39.040
 Okay, so we'll do practice now.

00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:57.270
 And we'll go to the mandala offering. Again, just kind of a little bit adding in regards to what we

00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:57.610
're offering. I think I went over at the beginning and that's a little bit related to Amadrapa's

00:37:57.610 --> 00:37:59.480
 question about what we're offering, and of course that's using our imagination, but also

00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:01.040
 remembering the teachings.

00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:07.450
 You know, in the teachings too, we're offering up the universe, Mount Merrow, the four continents,

00:38:07.450 --> 00:38:13.270
 the sun and the moon on the outer level, so then we can also think those five points, then also in

00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:24.040
 the teachings saying, you know, the five aggregates, everything that makes up our entire experience

00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:25.040
,

00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:31.060
 the way the Buddha pointed out, even on the most simple level of what makes up our entire

00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:40.160
 experience, all the forms, feelings, perceptions, mental formations, consciousness, you know, on

00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:46.540
 the ordinary sentient being level, using our imagination, offering up everything, but then kind of

00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:51.040
 keeping in mind that deeper teaching, offering up our five aggregates.

00:38:51.040 --> 00:39:00.170
 And then when they're purified, right, then in the teachings, that's nothing but the five, the five

00:39:00.170 --> 00:39:07.420
 wisdoms in blazing, you know, benefiting everyone, offering up that, the glorify, the three jewels

00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:09.040
 and benefit all beings.

00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:15.460
 You know, the five Buddhas purifying all of our obscurations, our five poisons, offering that up,

00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:22.270
 releasing, revealing the five wisdoms blazing, unhindered, you know, for everyone, everywhere, in

00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:29.560
 all the pure realms of all the Buddhas, throughout all samsara, you know, the infinite disguise of

00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:37.040
 samsara, just those wisdoms shining forth, removing all the veils of delusion.

00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:43.060
 And then again, on the common level, the five wisdom mothers are nothing but the five elements of

00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:48.040
 everything, just kind of thinking to reflecting on the teachings, as we're offering up everything,

00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:55.400
 what are the different ways the Buddha pointed out on the both, you know, again, common relative

00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:59.040
 truth, but also pure relative truth levels of the true nature.

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:04.900
 And then again, as we're offering, keeping to the best of our ability, that openness, that spacious

00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:24.040
ness and our emptiness awareness. So just thought to add that so.

00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:31.510
 We're also offering up our body, our trunk, our legs, our arms, you know, our white and red

00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:39.040
 elements of both the inner universe, the pure Vajra body, as well as the outer universe.

00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:48.050
 Everything is all within these mandalas. The bodies, enjoyments, possessions and glories of this

00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:53.800
 succession of all my lifetimes, I offer to the three jewels in order to complete the two

00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:55.040
 accumulation.
