00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.330
 Speech, enlightenment mind always represent enlightenment forms, enlightenment song, enlightenment

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.260
 speech, space and mind.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:20.880
 That is what it is. So that means when we practice this life as a beginning, we always try to

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:31.430
 visit joy and appreciation with bodhichitta, having those activated, signalized stages, then trying

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:31.720
 to

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:40.800
 really see that every environment is enlightened status. All is pure in this status. This again,

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:48.100
 everything is enlightened status. It's not just a way of making up according to the teaching of the

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:59.650
 bodhichaktamuni or in another. All is enlightened. Five elements are enlightened as five dainabudas

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:00.040
,

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:11.680
 all male buddhas. And five elements are enlightened as female buddhas. And every limbs and every

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:19.240
 activity is the emanation of the five male and the five female buddhas. Everything is enlightened.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.200
 So

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:30.750
 nothing is not enlightened. And why we don't see that now? Because of our dualities. Because our

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:31.760
 ego

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:43.660
 cleanings, because of our grasp of cleaning, completely mixed up, mixed up. That is what

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:50.680
 indigene buddhas and this ego cleaning, duality, this cleaning, all this indigene buddhas are known

00:01:50.680 --> 00:02:02.040
 as obscurations. Obscuration is not done from outside. Obscuration is one's own creations. What we

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:11.350
 created, we bled out by that. It's like cocoons. The threat of the cocoon, not just came from

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.840
 outside,

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:24.640
 wrapped up. Cocoon themselves trapped. Similarly is one's own things we trapped. This trapion is

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:25.000
 not

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.480
 going on and on. Not just happened now, but according to the teaching, it started from the

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:41.240
 beginning. And how long is it going to last? It's going to last forever unless we reverse it. Our

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:48.520
 practicing, our meditation, our meditation, all that we are releasing. We are at the moment that

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:56.360
 cocoons that thread. Threadness. So then what will come? Then it will come the true nature, the

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.840
 beauty

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.440
 of what we're talking, enlightenment what we're talking. That will come according to the teaching.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:11.440
 So therefore, in the beginning, the Buddha's teaching, in the beginning, the Buddha's teaching,

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:19.800
 the Buddha kind of told, gradually ushered us to these directions. And Mahayana, the Buddha,

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:26.760
 told about all kinds of unbelievable things. And Mahayana then told more forcefully and now,

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.880
 at the school, who means, pull of the school, who means teaching, is Mahayana teaching. We do

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:40.080
 westerns. So immediately we activated that old and natural without waiting so many years or the

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:47.560
 eons. Immediately we will bring up that. And when we bring this realization, as everything is

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:53.680
 enlightened, according to the sutra of teaching, the other sutra of teaching, it will take three

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:01.440
 countless eons. They call it the teaching. Even that is best. Shortest. It takes long time. But

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.920
 in the very end the teaching, through the sutra of means, and our courage and commitment and our

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:15.640
 devotion and joyful effort, we immediately connect to the nature. The true beauty. Immediately. And

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:22.440
 then beat that. So immediately, even though maybe we had a short glimpse of that realization,

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.600
 but we are connecting that. Due to the habit of everything, it goes away. But we are connecting

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:35.440
 that. You are getting directed to the enlightened state. So therefore, seeing that everything has

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:44.720
 enlightened state, then we take reference. So, three eons. And that is why, you all know,

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:53.000
 the three eons, Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, that is. And the Buddha, Dharma, Sangha is, Buddha is the

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.520
 great teacher by the Buddha Chakra Mani. And if Dharma is the teaching, such as then, all the

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:05.520
 teachings, the Naira teachings, all the basic Buddhist school teachings, the Maha, Sotramayana

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:11.760
 teaching, Vaidyana Mahayana teaching, all those are known as dharmas. Then generally Dharma has

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:18.880
 two dharmas, known as scriptural Dharma, realization dharmas. And those are all what I listed those

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:19.160
 in

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:27.000
 the scriptural Dharma. Scriptural Dharma, what it tells them, it tells moralities, it tells

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:34.360
 the concentrations, it tells the verse dharmas. When we activated that, then in your heart, mind,

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:41.400
 our heart and mind, that is known as realization dharmas. So we build close connection to the

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:48.960
 scriptural Dharma, as well as the meaning of that scripture. Scriptural Dharma, again I say, the

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:55.240
 meaning of that scripture, all of the Buddha's teaching can be summarized in these three extra

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:08.480
 only teachings on the moralities, all the disciplines, and extra only teachings on the

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:17.160
 concentrations, extra only teachings on the verse dharmas. And this discipline teaching is

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:27.840
 mainly kind of highlight of our conduct, our conduct, the way we should act. And then that

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:35.400
 when we have a good conduct, easily we can also control, we can balance our mind, easily counts as

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:46.880
 Samadhi concentrations, comes. When we both are guided by the Vastas, the Vastas, morality or the

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:53.960
 conduct of the discipline as well as the concentration, both are guided by the Vastas. Then all

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:54.320
 comes

00:06:54.320 --> 00:07:01.600
 perfectly, beautifully. Conduct of the discipline is beautiful, and the concentration is beautiful,

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:08.840
 that we meditate and all that. All the Dukki practices, all those beautiful, and the same

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:17.520
 time, glowing discovery of the innermost tools, that understand exactly where things are. Nothing

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:17.800
 higher,

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:25.280
 nothing lower, you see things. That is done. And the Sangha is spiritual, they have to practice and

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:34.440
 follow with that. And the Sangha is also known as a source of inspirations, who inspire us, who

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:41.640
 help us, to teach us to learn. We do the Sangha members, or we do it generally in Buddhism state,

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:48.880
 we do the sentient beings, how we can practice of the six parabas, how we can practice both each

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:55.520
 other, if there is no sentient beings. So for that reason, many great masters and teachings always

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:55.760
 say,

00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:02.840
 to get enlightenment or to become ourselves a Buddha, the sentient beings, Buddhists are equally

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:08.560
 kindness. Buddha gives the path and ensures the techniques and exactly, and sentient beings gives

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:16.760
 training and give the lesson. Lesson, combination, we develop and discover our energies. And

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:17.720
 therefore,

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:25.320
 even we didn't communicate all sentient beings, but Sangha members are so good, so special. And all

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:32.280
 those Sangha members want to hold the teachings. Buddha came 3,600 years ago, and teaching is

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:39.040
 still there. Who maintained, who kept up that? That was a continuous lineage, as exact as Buddha

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:46.560
 told. These Sangha members, their courage, their commitment, their joy and their devotees, upheld

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:54.240
 that teaching and transferred that one after that. Now, there, Sanghas are so important, they are

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:54.440
 known

00:08:54.440 --> 00:09:02.680
 as older of the teachings. So for that reason, I prefer to pronounce the connection to all of this,

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:13.080
 which is known as in Buddhism, three jubals. This is, of course, translated as a jubal,

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:20.700
 but in Tibet, it is translated as a kon-chul song. Kon-chul, kon-chul, kon-chul, kon-chul. Kon

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:23.040
 means very rare. So, kom is

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:30.580
 supreme. This is not just a regular jubal. Regular jubal, jubals are, if you are very rich, you can

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:30.800
 buy.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:43.310
 This jubal is a supreme, rare jubal. Jubal is, that's what in Tibet is used, I mean, at ancient

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:43.600
 time,

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:51.680
 such as great, under the bad news, bad news of the great king, Tristan Devli, Gurga Maasambhava,

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:59.120
 Chandaraki, the woman mother, and those old, great, awesome members. And that's really so beautiful

00:09:59.120 --> 00:09:59.120
,

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:06.160
 accurate vocabulary is done with terminologies. And this is one of them, again. I mean, these old

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:12.160
 things, they carry the perfect meaning of the teaching. They not just only make up their things,

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:18.400
 because they do all that, but they also combine all the teachings in different areas. I mean,

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:24.080
 both the teachings and as well the teachings of all those great masters, the Nalajunas, Asanghas,

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:30.480
 Maitreya, that kind of, all that, and put it back into a couple of words. Far from the Dharma

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:38.020
 terminology, to be the one of the richest Dharma terminology in this time. Because of their

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:38.640
 kindness,

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:47.520
 their compassion, and their versus. And even this rena, or the jubal, not just put as jubal,

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:57.200
 put on yourself. To this on yourself, I take refuge. And how long? Until I become the brotherhood,

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:04.000
 until I discover this absolute nature of my own beings, or after the enlightenment of the

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 body, sweet mind, everything in that, I take that refuge. So that is brilliant. Of course,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:16.400
 you all know. You all know, so I don't have to talk so many things. I just said,

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:22.960
 no, I don't. This is the end of the refuge, the refuge. From now, until I become the enlightenment,

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:28.480
 no matter whatever situation, circumstance, changing externally, my Buddha Dharma will be

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:36.080
 always in my heart, and I will continue to explore, and the source of my aspirations,

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:41.920
 and guidance, and a proof of happiness. And so that's, I feel close, connected to them.

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:49.920
 And so that's the step in love. And then, next one, is the rut bodhicata. It's just one line,

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:57.440
 but it's very powerful. It tells the exilimation of the bodhicata. Bodhicata is the generally

00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:04.640
 intention, our thought, again. But this time, in this bodhicata, it's not intention of the ego

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:13.520
 clean, not intention of the self-important, not intention of the self-centered mind. Instead,

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:22.000
 self-important, putting this intention, all the sentient beings, every living beings are important,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:29.120
 more important than my self-evident. And we can think that way. They're all important.

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:36.400
 And now, they're all there. So therefore, what is the principle called, root of the compa...

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:43.440
 or this bodhicata? Root of the essence of bodhicata is compassion. And loving kindness.

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:48.800
 Loving kindness is compassion. This love and compassion is not just a lot like love and

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:55.280
 compassion. It is love and compassion to all living beings. Those we know, those we don't know,

00:12:55.280 --> 00:13:00.000
 those who are here, those who are gone from sight, according to the Buddha's teaching,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:06.560
 they're not disabled. They are, in some way, in the six realms, somewhere in the samsara.

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:12.060
 Therefore, we are going to generate the situation, reaching every good thing for every living being

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:12.160
,

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:18.240
 from the heart, from the good heart. This is the one called, in some times, the Dini,

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:24.720
 unconditional compassion, unconditional love. This is not unconditional love and compassion

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:30.880
 to local life, but all living beings. This is sincerely reaching good things.

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:36.800
 This is also bodhicata has truth. With the beginning bodhicata, and when you're

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:42.800
 stoned and activated, that bodhicata begins bodhicata, which is also known as

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:49.440
 reaching bodhicata and actualizing bodhicata. Reaching bodhicata and actualizing bodhicata.

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:55.280
 So that means why you have now developed that signaling compassion, allowing kindness for all

00:13:55.280 --> 00:14:02.880
 living beings. That is known as wishing bodhicata. That attitude, that intensity, that will talk,

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:09.840
 that powerful will talk, is known as wishing bodhicata. And that can be a little bit kind of

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:15.440
 how we practice that, how we do practice with that bodhicata. That is the engraver of Master

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:21.280
 Munshi Pahe, you know, everyone say, to practice with wishing bodhicata, we did four formless

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:21.920
 practices.

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:28.880
 That we all know, our Buddha's heart, when we practice, it has that. May all living beings have

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:37.200
 happiness, cause of happiness. That is loving kindness practice. May all living beings have

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:42.320
 happiness, cause of happiness. Not just they have, just they feel the love, but we also

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:50.240
 wish they have the continuing happiness because of the cause. If you have the perfect cause to

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:55.760
 be happiness, then it will continue. If we don't have that cause, it will come to maybe a short

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:56.160
 time,

00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:03.360
 but it goes big. So cause and condition completely have that happiness all the time. May all living

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:11.280
 beings have happiness and cause of happiness. That is formless compassion of the wishing bodhicata.

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:18.240
 The second is, then what? May all living beings have that, free from the suffering. May all

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:27.520
 living beings are free from the sufferings and cause of sufferings. Again, resolve and cause

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:35.360
 wishing bodh. That is great compassion. Great compassion of the wishing bodhicata. We are

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:43.200
 activating that, activating that. Very seamlessly. Not just awake, attitude, those pop-pop or

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:51.600
 kind of wishing bodhicata, but you are really activating that. And the next one is, is great

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:59.280
 joy or rejoices. That and about. Again, may all living beings have the great happiness which is

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:07.520
 free from the sufferings. Sufferings. Free from sufferings. See, that's the great rejoice.

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:14.240
 Great happiness. As we have the great love and completion, and they have happiness and have good

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:23.920
 times, then you will rejoice. Not just a few people, but you have all the living beings.

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:32.240
 The next one is a great balance, equanimity of the, again, wishing bodhi. May all living,

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:38.080
 we have the great equanimity realization, free from the attachment to the close ones,

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:44.160
 reject to the others. As we jump. I'm hearing this, may all living beings, that is kind of

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:50.640
 extreme, but that understanding is all that happens. And also in some other teaching, also we can

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:56.960
 say what, may all mother-sentence beings always have happiness, the cause of happiness. May all

00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:02.370
 mother-sentence beings always free from the sufferings, cause of sufferings. May all mother-sent

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:02.560
ence

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:08.800
 beings have the great joy, joy that which is free from sufferings. May all mother-sentence beings

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:14.160
 always have the great equanimity realization, free from the attachment to the close ones,

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:21.760
 reject to the others. When you join that, if you reflect that meaning, meaning that is known as

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:28.560
 wishing bodhi. And also when you join and reflect that meaning, how beautiful is, how really

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:28.880
 beautiful,

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:39.840
 how special. There's no ego cleanings and some important energy in that, that place, that time.

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:45.440
 For that reason, in the teaching always, this is one of the great healing practices too,

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:50.800
 purification practices, healing practices, in the same time. Accumulating the merit, the good

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:51.440
 energies,

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:59.750
 merit of the accumulated merit, wisdom merit, all that comes, comes these practices. It's so

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:00.560
 powerful.

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:07.040
 Great kenji partition will be making many a time. So even just one of, alone, one of them, alone,

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:12.800
 may all living beings, may all mother-sentence beings have the great happiness and the cause

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:19.280
 of happiness. Just a giant reflect on that meaning and then relax that, on that. It's really,

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:27.280
 it's self-isn't. Full practices, full practice. It's self-isn't. The essence of the mindfulness

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:32.160
 practice. These days we will let mindfulness. They're talking about that. They see the benefit of

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:32.640
 that

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:38.880
 mindfulness. If you take that way and relax your mind, it will calm down our mind.

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:48.160
 And that means it calm down all the, all the energies, running consulsions, running thoughts

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:55.440
 and the stress force. Everything is subsided. All that goes on the same way. That is known as the

00:18:55.440 --> 00:19:03.760
 Wishing Bodita. Actualizing Bodita is, and practices, six paralana. We did this Wishing Bodita. We

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:03.920
 did

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:11.840
 for wellness. And six paralana. Those six paralanas, I just listed the names and then of course you

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:12.080
 can

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:18.320
 look to go to many other books and as well as most easy to look the reference is what's called

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:30.480
 Google E. It's an easy way to get all that information. Google E or Zoom E. And those six

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:39.760
 paralanas are the university practices, morality practices, and then the ancient practices and

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:47.200
 the beautiful effort of practices, course in the practices. And then most of them practices,

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:53.200
 those are known as six paralanas, but that all best upon these four boneless practices.

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:59.680
 And we have that attitude, that thought, then it will shake up the samsara. Truly,

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:10.000
 samsara is duality, samsara is ignorance, samsara is ego-cleaning. And we have that,

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:18.400
 those we were taught. Truly, it will shake up. It will shake up or it will smash the samsara.

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:26.880
 And samsara is this, samsara means suffering, difficulty, troubles, uncertain, unreliable,

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:34.960
 then going on and on. That really will shake this by this, this. So for that reason, I generate the

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:42.320
 bodhicitta, vision bodhicitta, and actualizing bodhicitta. So that is what we need about that

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:48.240
 meaning, bodhicitta. And now, next one, so that's that point, what we need completed,

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:54.320
 the beginning novel, that starts. And the last middle novel is then...
