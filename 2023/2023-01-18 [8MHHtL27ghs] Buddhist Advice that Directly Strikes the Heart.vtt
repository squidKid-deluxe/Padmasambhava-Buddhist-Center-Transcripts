Khenpo Tsewang Rinpoche offers direct heart advice to Buddhist practitioners.\nVen. Khenpo Rinpoche discusses the Seven Noble Treasures:\n\n1. Faith\n2. Morality\n3. Generosity\n4. Study\n5. Self-Respect\n6. Respecting Others\n7. Wisdom\n\nPBC Palden Sherab Pema Ling Retreat Center:\nLotus Land of Glorious Wisdom\n18190 131st Trail N\nJupiter, FL  33478\n\nEmpowerment of Guru Padmasambhava as Guru Vidyadhara (in person only)\nRevealed by the Great Terton Tsasum Lingpa\n(Sunday Morning, January 15 - In Person Only at Pema Ling in Jupiter, Florida)\n\nGuru Padmasambhava gave a variety of teachings to benefit future generations. Among these, in the Vajrayana, connecting to your teacher is essential to invoke the power and beauty of the nature of mind. Therefore Guru Rinpoche gave many teachings on how to practice on Guru Padmasambhava, many of which were hidden by the wisdom dakini Yeshe Tsogyal.\n\nThis particular terma was revealed by the famous terton Tsasum Lingpa in the 17th century, and is considered one of the blessed and powerful practices for connecting to Guru Rinpoche as a sambhogakaya emanation known as Guru Vidyadhara. This terma is a condensed practice of all three Inner Tantras of Mahayoga, Anuyoga, and Atiyoga.\n\nThe Dzogchen teachings are the highest and most direct teachings of the Buddha Shakyamuni on the nature of mind. They show us how to discover our own inner beauty and realize everlasting peace for ourselves and all beings. Ven. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche will give these rare and essential heart instructions according to the great master Shechen Gyaltsab Gyurme Pema Namgyal Rinpoche. These direct and profound teachings impart the critical points and central supports for all practitioners to maintain to keep our practice fresh, alive, and beneficial for everyone.\n\n\u201cIn brief, to recognize your own nature is the view.\nWhen you abide within it, that is the meditation.\nAnd if you have no attachment, that is superior conduct.\nWhen you arrive at the primordially free fundamental nature, that is described as the fruition.\nAll are included in the natural state beyond concepts.\u201d\n\nShechen Gyaltsab Gyurme Pema Namgyal Rinpoche (1871-1926) was the reincarnation of Orgyen Rangjung Dorje, and was the fourth regent of Shechen Monastery. Shechen Gyaltsab was the disciple and heart-son of Mipham Rinpoche. He also studied closely with the First Great Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo and the First Great Jamgon Kongtrul Rinpoche, among many other extraordinary Nyingma and Sarma masters. He focused for many decades on the key points of Creation and Completion Stage practices. Shechen Gyaltsab excelled in all three activities of the learned--exposition, debate, and composition--undertaking the three practices of listening, reflecting and meditating for his own benefit, and the three activities of teaching, debating and writing for the benefit of others.\n\nVen. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche is a holder of the complete Buddhist Nyingma lineage of study and practice. He was enthroned by H.H. Dudjom Rinpoche as a Nyingma Abbot. As an accomplished scholar and Vajrayana master, Rinpoche has an amazing ability to convey profound topics simply and directly, making the rich, vast ocean of Dharma accessible and easy to put into practice.\n\nwww.padmasambhava.org\nwww.pbdc.net",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.400
 The seven triages of the Dhanu are the spiritual or seven triages of the Dhanu. First is Devotion,

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:25.240
 or head. F-A-I-C-H-E-N. Second is morality, and the third is generosity or sharing.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:57.480
 And the fourth is the learning or studying. And the fifth is self-respect. And the next one is

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.480
 respect to the others.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:13.700
 And seventh is worship. Those are known as seven triages or seven luxuries of the Dharma or the

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:23.960
 virtues. For that reason, the great master Nagarjuna, in his letter to his friend, he said,

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:33.870
 "This seven," he listed, and he told, "This is the Supreme Luxury College that was taught by the

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:41.680
 great teacher." Great teacher taught. That means Buddha taught. These are the seven triages.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:49.650
 For that reason, you keep these seven triages. This is seven triages. If we have these seven, seven

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:58.160
 triages, our spiritual Dharma practice is really going to go well, so well. I guarantee it to you.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:22.230
 But this is seven triages. The first is Devotion, or head. And the third is called Deva. Deva is

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.640
 devotion. Deva, devotion, or head, is so important.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:37.690
 At the beginning of time, in the middle, and end. That means, at the beginning of practice, we need

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:45.210
 devotion, or head. We need a path where you practice, for that reason, I'm talking, where you

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:50.000
 practice for now, one year or two years, we continually need a path.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.800
 He continuously. At the path, we need to fulfilment. Without the path, we want to fulfilment. Even

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:05.180
 we practice for a year, two years, without our path, without kind of lack of the pathness, then we

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.280
 retire from Dharma.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:13.300
 Many times that happens. Those older, when you become practicing for quite a while, when you're in

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:20.530
 a young town, or when they're not retiring, practicing, when they retire from the outside, or the

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:28.160
 professional job externally resigns, at the same time, they retire from the spiritual activities.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:38.790
 Really that, because the devotion of head is so shallow, so weak. And if that happens, according to

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:48.250
 Buddhism, Buddha's teaching, that is obstacle. Obstacle is really blocking our path, preventing our

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.160
 path. Immediately that.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:57.570
 So trying to keep up this train, along with that, we all know, we heard so many, these poor,

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:08.900
 renowned, renowned second thoughts, very sly, precious, this immanent, cause and the effect of the

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.160
 inevitable, and the samsara has challenged the difficulty.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:24.010
 Reflecting those, as much as we can, our mind, these poor points, is really so powerful. And we

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:33.150
 have the truly understanding of the meaning of the precious lives of ourselves. We won't spoil our

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:40.160
 life, waste our lives. We see how precious it is.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:46.890
 Then second is the empowerment. Even though we have precious lives, precious, these beautiful

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:55.160
 things, but it's not going to last forever. Therefore, take the moment, take the time right now.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:06.360
 Now is the time. It's not something. Next time is not. Next time is not time. Now is time. Now this

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:16.160
 time is our capabilities, our reign. We have every capabilities to do what we like to do now.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:27.610
 Future is not exactly sure, but now is really the most important time. Therefore, see the precious

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:36.260
 time and practice. And together with that, cause and effect are inevitable. All cause and results

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.160
 are inevitable.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:47.200
 Is that externally true? When you have good cause or perfect cause and perfect conviction, we don't

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:52.160
 have to have doubt, not develop the result or prove it.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:06:00.720
 The same thing is spiritual. Dharma same thing. If we have perfect cause and conviction, it really

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.160
 drains the result.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:12.160
 Also, in the teachings said, we have perfect knowledge of this cause and conviction in our temple.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:21.160
 Ourself, each of ourself, becomes more mindfulness, more power to our actions and ourself, ourself.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:31.250
 So we become more. So that means we become ourself as teachers, to ourself, support. We become the

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.160
 support to ourself.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:40.580
 Well, that's what the great teacher Buddha said also in the teaching. I show you the path, where to

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.160
 go, but now is your path. You have to apply.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:58.380
 But realization is your hand. It's not that Buddha will take us by hand, throw a home. We have to

00:06:58.380 --> 00:06:59.160
 apply.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:10.560
 Allah Nation is our hand. And then, next one, Samsara has troubles. Samsara has challenges. This is

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.160
 the one called Samsara, called Buddhism.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:20.730
 There is always challenge. No matter what we are, what situation, where we are, even in human

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:26.160
 realms, in animal realm, whole realm, the other realms, so many troubles.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:32.160
 God's realm too. There is so much troubles at the end of their lives, at the core of the teaching.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:38.160
 But the human realm is mixed. So many things going on. We know that.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:47.160
 For that reason, we have courage, commitment, confidence, and reverse the situation.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:53.160
 Not reverse the situation externally. Because the great teacher Buddha said, it's all our mind.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:59.160
 If we start changing from the mind, it will reverse. Change.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:04.160
 So those are, for example, these devotions, faith are related.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:10.670
 For those reasons, in every practice teaching that you know, we know, we all heard some, and always

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:12.160
 reflecting the four points.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:19.580
 Many times, we can't really, can't really think. All those are very common. All those are basic

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:20.160
 things.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:26.160
 But basic things is so important. That's what we are standing. It's so practical.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:31.160
 Really, if we ignore the basic things, then we won't get the advanced things.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:38.970
 So therefore, it started from this number one, at the beginning, from the A, and then all the

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:42.160
 letter will follow, until the Z.

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:50.160
 That's how it's really done. And the next one is, then, this morality.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:56.160
 Morality is the ground foundation of all the spiritual growths.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:02.160
 It's so important. I call it Buddhism. Conduct is so important.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:07.160
 That's why it is what the great teacher, the Buddha said, I'm going to give.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:16.160
 The first is teachings. It starts with morality. Morality. Morality teaches.

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.160
 And then, of course, morality can be made.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:27.160
 The principle of morality teaching is, is avoiding all the negative activities.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:35.160
 Morality that will avoid all the negative activities, by verbally, and physically,

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:41.160
 and also mentally trying as much as you can, as much as we can.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.160
 Please try to avoid that.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:48.160
 Every moment mentally is developed, even though it's not activated externally,

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:54.160
 but also moment is happening, and we're recognized by our mindfulness, our awareness,

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:58.160
 or we can detect that, and immediately, that is called.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:03.160
 That is called. And morality, that's now. How that?

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:11.160
 It is, again, it's called teaching in Buddhism. It's the ground of the Dharma, spiritual ground.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:19.160
 With all the good moralities, spiritual practice will become bodily, bodily.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:26.580
 And therefore, with our courage and commitment, with aspiration, try to keep the morality as much

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:28.160
 as you can.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:35.160
 The symbol itself, avoiding all the negative activities, directly, indirectly,

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:39.160
 that hurt the others, or as well as ourself.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:47.160
 And performing the positive, beneficial activities, as much as we can, that hurt the others,

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:54.160
 and as well as ourself. Those are all the moralities.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:11:03.160
 And then, next one is...

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:12.160
 Then, generosity is sharing. That means sharing things. What do we have?

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:19.160
 And that is, in a Buddhism, in Mahārāja teaching, sharing the material objects,

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:28.160
 and sharing the knowledge, and sharing with your capabilities, or your skills.

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:34.160
 And really, again, bodhicap, sharing that with your bodhicap.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:41.160
 According to your capabilities, according to the readiness of that, so share, give to the others.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:50.730
 Others, your heart is open, and as much as you can do, holding that, and that is generosity, wealth

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:52.160
 of generosity.

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:59.160
 What is this? It's opening our grasping and clinging, kind of the illusion of grasping, clinging.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:05.160
 And then, also, it is great, very true activities, very true activities.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:12.160
 The next one is...

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:16.160
 And studying is, the whole Buddhism is really important.

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:21.160
 Even though, generally, there is, like according to the New Mahārāja teaching,

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:24.160
 or the practical lineage, always there is yoga.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:30.160
 A kind of easy approach to the meditation, practice, all those big instructions.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:35.160
 And it suggests this time, this is true, big instructions, big instructions.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:42.920
 There is not so many philosophical discussions, but you have to know what you are going to practice

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:43.160
.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:49.160
 And you have to know what are also the obstacles, hindrances of any way to practice.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:59.760
 So it is not carried by the kind of, like, false signs. F-A-L-S-E, I believe, forces, signs and

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:01.160
 indications carried with that.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:06.380
 That kind of is really, look at you, thinking, oh, this is a great sign, why practice, this and

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:07.160
 that thing.

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:11.900
 Reality is really under me. Those are, in the Buddha teaching, in the Pāṇḍa Bhāramana

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:13.160
 teaching, others say,

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:18.160
 there are so many obstacles that can come during the practices, and there are so many kind of

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:18.160
 emotional levels.

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:22.160
 And the visual levels, the dream levels, this and that thing,

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:31.160
 but it is diluting our practices and weakening our practices, practices, and then ended up there.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:37.160
 So therefore, no starting, and the contemplation is so important.

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:42.160
 That's the one that becomes more stronger and solid.

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:47.160
 So therefore, starting the teaching, starting the practice, starting one of your practices,

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:51.160
 always a little bit more know of that, so then you have more confidence.

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:56.160
 It's not just practices, it's not just only the blood, hair, or the belief,

00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:00.160
 but it's also something, knowledge, awareness, token of the mind.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:06.160
 That is really very special, special practices there, and that.

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:12.160
 So to be, you do that. In the next one, and to be, tell me about it.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:20.690
 And respect to the one's own self. And also now, with respect to our, in Buddhism, in the Buddha

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:21.160
 teaching,

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:25.160
 respect to our one's own self, respect to the others.

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:28.160
 And one's own self, we have respect for.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:36.010
 And those I call very energy, they say, this program, our body, is made out of the disease, is made

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:37.160
 out of.

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:43.160
 And that we know, five ugly worlds are five main Buddhas.

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:48.160
 Five elements are five human Buddhas, where they are our limbs,

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:54.160
 limbs and all these odd bodhisattva, male and female.

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:58.160
 Where they are is our body.

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:02.160
 And then in it, and there's many times more teaching in the same, cochlear,

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:06.160
 the heart center is made out of all the pieces of Buddhas.

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:13.160
 And then, brain is made out of all the wrath of the disease.

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:17.160
 Those are really, actually, true, the God and the teaching.

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:24.160
 So this is our body, it's divine made out of, or it's a temple, certainly a temple.

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:28.160
 Therefore, we have to respect, in that way, physically.

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:32.160
 And then also our mental level, we have to respect to ourselves.

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:36.160
 We have to respect, for example, bodhisattva, we talk.

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:40.160
 We talk rafuji, rafuji, bodhisattva.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:46.160
 We talk also with knowledge, with it, clearly knowing what we're doing.

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:52.160
 And therefore, keeping up the rafuji, vavas, is self-respect.

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:58.160
 Keeping up the bodhisattva is self-respect.

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:02.160
 Bodhisattva always says, "We're going to follow you, Buddhas and bodhisattva.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:07.160
 You follow in that. Exactly, we're going to try to follow what you did.

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:10.160
 Mother, we're going to follow."

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:14.160
 Second sentence is being sent in this, we're going to do that.

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:18.160
 Again, if we don't follow exactly, then we are kind of almost like,

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:23.160
 what we say, what we're doing, is not making it.

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:28.160
 It's disrespectful to our world, our world.

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:31.160
 And all those levels, we have to respect.

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:38.160
 And then in Mahayana teaching, this body is so important,

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:43.160
 important to cross the river of the samsara.

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:47.160
 And what the great Master Shanti devil said,

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:54.160
 with the relying of the body of this body,

00:16:54.160 --> 00:17:03.160
 I will cross the river of the challenges.

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:09.160
 And this board of the body is not always available.

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:15.160
 Therefore, I should not rest this body.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:18.160
 That's what great Master Shanti devil said.

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:21.160
 So this is so, so important.

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:24.160
 And then self-respect is also self-respect.

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:27.160
 Our generation can't be like family members.

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:30.160
 And all the others, thinking of everyone,

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:33.160
 that one don't want to be appointed.

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:35.160
 I don't want to have to do something.

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:39.160
 I like to keep myself strong, and that.

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:42.160
 And that we are respected to the others.

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:46.160
 I respect to one's own self, several respect to others.

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:49.160
 In that way, I can respect others.

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:51.160
 And generally, that we respect.

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:55.160
 But at the same time, all the other rules and guidelines

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:58.160
 and systems, there are so many different things,

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:03.160
 but we also respect through all those rules, guidelines.

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:07.160
 And whatever those is, if we are associated with that,

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:12.160
 we should respect and follow that, our best capabilities.

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:16.160
 And if we follow that risk, then what cause?

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:20.160
 Also, our uncle's son will be very happy, too.

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:26.160
 We will become the best nephew and niece of the uncle's son.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:29.160
 So there, for me, this is really important.

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:32.160
 Self-respect, respect to the others.

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:37.160
 I think I'm just listening to you here. And then versus us.

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:41.160
 Knowledge, versus us, is seeing clearly things,

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:46.160
 exactly as it is, not understanding our status,

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:51.160
 not contesting, believing, but seeing things clearly,

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:53.160
 as much as we can see.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:56.160
 Those are seven trade yields.

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:59.160
 Really, I explained the seven trade yields,

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:01.160
 and those are the supreme.

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:03.160
 Among the other great masters,

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:07.160
 an early one, I'd say, in relative practice.

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:11.160
 So he's making all that wealth, those seven wealth,

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:17.160
 those others, supreme wealth, or luxurious items.

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:19.160
 And then he said that.

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:25.160
 And whoever has contaminant, contaminant,

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:30.160
 that is supreme wealth, contaminant.

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:33.160
 And even, he said, if you have the contaminant,

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:35.160
 even if you don't have anything,

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:38.160
 still your heart will be rich.

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:41.160
 Heart is rich. Really hard.

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:43.160
 That is the rich person.

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:45.160
 That's very practical.

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:48.160
 Many times, those rich people, wealthy people,

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:50.160
 looks like so wealthy,

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:53.160
 but they are always striving for this and that.

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:57.160
 And then all that, we heard so many times.

00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:01.160
 The desire, the other whatever, is not necessarily satisfied

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:05.160
 and become all, really, so many things.

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:07.160
 So many things happening.

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:10.160
 Because when you have the contaminant, contaminant,

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:14.160
 that is the best wealth, you see.

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:16.160
 And then he said, in the teaching,

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:19.160
 he said, even if you have the money of wealth,

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:24.160
 big wealth is the cause of the many headaches.

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:28.160
 In another realm, in the occult and the teaching of the Buddha,

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:32.160
 none of those kings, those nine kings,

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:36.160
 some had three heads, some had five heads,

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:39.160
 some had seven heads, none of the kings.

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:41.160
 As much as they have the kings,

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:45.160
 they are not king of all wealth, according to the teaching.

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:50.160
 But even if they have that many heads, that many troubles.

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:52.160
 That many troubles.

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:56.160
 Even they are so glorious and so looks like, so special,

00:20:56.160 --> 00:21:00.160
 but in reality, there are more troubles.

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:04.160
 So therefore, again, the greatest teacher will say,

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:08.160
 they won't make all the extremes, follow the middle way.

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:13.160
 That is simple, beautiful, and very luxurious,

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:15.160
 and the heart is quite rich.

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:18.160
 So that is so close to the chicken.

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:20.160
 And now I'm going to start here.

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:23.160
 Thank you very much everyone for coming.

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:25.160
 And thank you everyone.
