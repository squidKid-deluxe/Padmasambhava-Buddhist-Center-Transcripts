00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 Think of how we can make mistakes, how we can break Samayas, how we can break Samayas.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 And that is generally in the Buddha's teaching and specifically in the Vedaya teachings.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 Generally in the Buddha's teaching, the soul of the breaking Samaya or breaking the vows or

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 breaking the morality has four causes.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 Four causes. Four causes. Those are, first is not knowing, not knowing.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 And secondly is disrespectfulness. And third is, and third is carelessness.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 And the fourth is, and too many emotions.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 So that is four. In the Tibetan, I said we are talking this in the Tibetan, so we talked a bit.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:24.740
 In the Tibetan, first is unknowing is mashippa. Mashippa, M-A-S-H-E, I think that's it, M-A-S-H-E-S

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:25.000
 maybe, P-A, mashippa.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:36.370
 And second is mashippa, mashippa, mashippa, and disrespectful. And that is in the Tibetan, mashippa

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:47.000
, M-A-G-U-N-P-A, mashippa, mashippa, maybe you can add S-G-U-S, mashippa, mashippa, mashippa.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 And third is pamippa, pamippa, pamippa is B-A-G-N-M-E-D-P-A, pamippa. So that is carelessness.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 And the fourth is, what is the fourth? The fourth is nyumumbamma, there are too many emotions.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 Nyumumbamma, N-Y-O-N-N-O-N-G, nyumumbamma. And second word, M-A-N-G-N-W-A, nyumumbamma.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:40.180
 Those are generally Buddha teaching, maybe the full source of the, we break samayas, or we break

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.000
 vows, or we break those instructions, those four.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 Then you ready and I added two more. That is forgetful and confused. So forgetful and confused.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 That is true.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:15.460
 And that is in Tibet, in Tibet, forgetful is J-E. J-E, J-E-N-G-E, J-N-A, J-N-A. So that's just a

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.000
 pronunciation, J-N-A.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 And J-E-N-G-E, C-supa. And the next one is C-supa. S-E-M-T-S-U-B and B-A, maybe B-A, not B-A.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 So C-supa, C-supa. So that is, these are then plus, those all together, six.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:07.540
 First is Mishipa. First is unknowing. And now, unknowing is. That is, of course, we break the samay

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:08.000
as, or we break the vows, because we don't know what this should do, what don't do.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:16.580
 But it's not that what we do, what we don't do. Buddha had to lay out everything so detailed, so

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:21.000
 thoughtful, really so thoughtful, so all.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 It's all so simple, so simple and so with common senses. With the common senses.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:36.020
 It's not something that Buddha is breaking, kind of like methologica, other side of the universe is

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.000
 a story and apply and do this, do that.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 If you don't do that, that's not correct. It's not.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:50.070
 With the common sense of the human work, it's really, Buddha lay out so beautifully how to guide

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.000
 ourself, guide ourself, or how to support our practice.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 So, and therefore then, we learn, such as vows, we learn the samayas.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.600
 It's a lay out of the, in a way, road map, road map of our enlightenment, for our discovery of the

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.000
 Buddha nature.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 The complete lay out, so beautifully, so perfectly. So therefore, then, we don't have that.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000
 The trouble of not knowing is all lay out, quite beautifully.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 Maneta in the teaching said, when you don't know the vows, we have the vows, we have the vows.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 When you know the vows, we don't have the vows. What does that mean?

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 When you know the inward in the Tibetan energy, you see.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:45.120
 When you don't know the Vinaya, you have the vows. When you know that Vinaya, then you don't have

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.000
 the vows.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 So, that happens. So therefore, when you don't know, then you don't know.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 So then, it's something you can do. And that is what, also I think, what in teaching, not teaching,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 what in here say?

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:08.320
 Ignorant is bliss. Ignorant is bliss. When you don't know the Vinaya, then you have the vows, it's

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.000
 bliss.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 But you have the Chinese wisdom, then we see, oh, I did something, I'm not. You can find out that.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 So, we don't have the troubles of not knowing.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 And the second is, then, we can break the vows, or the dynamic desires, because we disrespect.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:41.230
 We know all things, but then we have no respect. And that is no respect, and then you can make

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:42.000
 mistakes.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:51.090
 And now, we know the vow, we have the respect, then, when something happens, because of care

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:52.000
lessness.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 Carelessness. Then, that happens.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:04.780
 And now, we have all that. We know, we respect, we pay attention, but then the next one, fourth one

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:06.000
, is too much emotions.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 We control the power of the emotions, then we break the rules. We break the rules. So, that.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.000
 And that is, those are known as four rules of the, of the breaking the rules.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 Four causes, causes of four reasons that we can break.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:35.540
 Then, above the video, the teaching added that two more. That is, we have all that, we respect

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:37.000
 everything, but we forget it.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 Forget it. Our mindfulness alert does not stop, and now, we forget it.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 And the next one is, we have everything, we not forget it, but we confuse it.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 Confuse it, and we, again, it is, and we get mistakes.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:00.440
 When mistakes happen, it's mistakes. Whatever that is, whatever reason to happen, mistakes,

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.000
 mistakes, it's mistakes.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 The moment you're aware of the mistakes, then you should restore, not usual, we should restore.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 We should restore our practice.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:21.420
 According to the different teachings, and basically, quickly, and very early teaching, then, such

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:25.000
 as, such as, practice on the vajayasathas, vajayasathas.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 We did, as we received the teaching from the Guru, we did four powers, four powers, and purify.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 Thinking of high light of that thought, and purify.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:44.000
 All do mandatory activities, mandatory activities, such as making offerings.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:51.000
 For example, when we do the sok se remun, nana jakar offering, that is also really one of the very

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 powerful in the teachings,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.510
 purifications, and the fulfillment, restoring the walls, and we make offerings of the light, inc

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:04.000
ense, candle, and amrta, and rakta, and kolma offerings.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:10.430
 Those are all, in the teachings, so powerful, it really has a lot of symmetric, and it will restore

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:13.000
 that, and clears away that,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:19.250
 and then possibly, then, some of the certain embolism of the temple and the stukas, Paul's

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:21.000
 teachings, and the generosity practices.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:29.290
 Common community, kind of good community, that services, you know, that benefit to the others, or

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:31.000
 help to the elders, elders.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:37.060
 All that, when you do those, in the teachings, it will purify those, make it what you want to do

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:38.000
 with that.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 So, this is what we do, purifications, and then, particularly.
