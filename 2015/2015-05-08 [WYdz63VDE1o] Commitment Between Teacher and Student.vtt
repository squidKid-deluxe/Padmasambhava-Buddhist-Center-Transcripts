00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 ...completely introduces us to the nature of mind. Does that teacher have a kind of obligation or

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.000
 commitment to keep working with us? Of working on us?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 See that again? I'm glad to be. Sorry. One more time.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.150
 If we find a teacher who completely introduces us to the nature of mind, does that teacher have a

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.000
 kind of obligation to continue working on us or with us?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 Oh, yeah. I think you made contact. You made contact. So, I don't think we can break contact.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:46.970
 I mean, this teacher, this is, I think, the point of what's called the practice of the student at

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:57.180
 the civil side, but generally we look for kind of people in Buddhism that whoever introduces to you

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.000
 the nature of the mind,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:08.990
 and with this kind of you, it makes some change. That's considering your principal teachers,

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.000
 principal teachers, principal teachers.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.910
 And that principal teachers, then you must kind of keep that practice, keep that practice with

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:26.000
 devotion, with confidence, with joy, and keep that.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.880
 And then teachers, definitely, if you keep that, and teachers, bless you, well, come. Bless you,

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.000
 well, come. Whoever had that, that's the teaching said.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.970
 It's not something that that teacher has obligated. Of course, his way of obligation is that the

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.000
 teacher has obligation and the student has obligation.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.050
 And the teacher has obligation to teach and guide and help and support, and the student has

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:03.150
 obligations to keep up the practices, with devotion, with joy, with confidence, with us, teacher,

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.000
 and stop it.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 So, it's like, in a way, mutual, mutual obligations.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 Mutual obligation is not just only one side, and it, I think, definitely, is mutual obligations.
