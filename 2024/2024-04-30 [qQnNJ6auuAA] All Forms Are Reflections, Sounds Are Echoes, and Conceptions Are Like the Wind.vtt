00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.400
 Again, another son and another daughter listen to me. See this form, this body, our body, see our

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.080
 body as a reflection moon in the waters.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:25.040
 So form is a reflection of the water. So that means not too much grasping, clinging.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:32.360
 This is illusion bodice. This is not just only Dzogchen teaching. Even in the Vaniya teaching, Vani

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.040
ya teaching said, Buddha said,

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:44.040
 "Poem is like a water bubble. Is it like a water bubble? Is it a reflection moon in the waters?"

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:55.210
 Water. See that. So that means therefore, if you say it in a kind of higher level, is lucid. Lucid

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:56.040
 bodice is not solid form.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:03.040
 It's massive. All the different atoms and different particles of yoga together inform this body.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:11.490
 So it's like a reflection, even though a bird, a bird, a reality, is not something that truly

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.040
 exists in solid things.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:22.040
 And also when we heard that too, form is in permanent. Of course, there is truth in permanent.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:29.040
 Gross in permanent and subtle in permanent. We're not talking that it's not gross in permanent.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:38.040
 Subtle in permanent. Body is shifting every second. Our body is malachous, atoms, particles.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:45.040
 Whatever you put, it really does only change. Every second, even if we don't, we didn't detect it.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:54.040
 This is not just our body, but this universal world, what forms what we see. It's every second that

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.040
 that is the closest to our deepest we can detect it.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:10.040
 Further deeper that is shifting. Further that is empty, open space.

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:22.040
 That open space is within this body. Therefore, this great bastard, when they had the realization,

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:29.040
 and say, "I'm going to play my ensemble." Burn in the fire, nothing happened. Throw in the water,

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.040
 nothing happened.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:42.040
 Push down on the underground, nothing happened. Because they got realization or they can see it.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:51.040
 Everything is displayed of light as a lucid state. So emptiness cannot hurt to the emptiness.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:03:00.040
 It's all in the same state. Therefore, those great masters go through walls, sitting on the sky,

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:07.040
 transforming different elements for different elements, each other, own them.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:14.750
 There's no solid structure, reality level. And we understand that this is the most of those physics

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.040
, science physics, quantum physics.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:26.040
 They're just governance of things. That's just governance. That's the reality, the nature of this.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:33.040
 This is not just making up the stories. This is not just a belief. It is about it.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:46.420
 Then there's also, and that is also we joined, almost every human it is. Yeah, we joined every

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:47.040
 human.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:54.350
 There's 21 words that introduce the nature of the mind or the nature of 3 Gaya by Gaurav and some

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:55.040
 of us.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:04.040
 We joined. All the poems are what? All this what we see through the eye is.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:14.040
 And all the poems outside, inside. And whatever you say, all this, even though you see this effort,

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:21.040
 a period is not solid. It's clear, void, emptiness, emptiness.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:36.040
 But that is what we're working on. The one with 25 disciples, one of nine students.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:43.040
 And that is here, we have that. You all know, we all know that we joined so many.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:49.320
 All these poems that appears to the eye, that see, all things on the outside, inside, the

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.040
 environment, inhabited,

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:58.040
 appeared, but let them rest with no salt is formed. No salt is formed.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:05.040
 Perceived and perceived, we put it by our body of the deity, clay, emptiness.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:11.040
 That's clay, emptiness status. So it's like reflection in the waters.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:21.040
 And similarly, then there's a market. And all the speech, song, is like echoes.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.040
 All the songs, speeches, also it's like echoes.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:32.720
 That means, even though a period says something, but there's no substantial, again, solid existence

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:33.040
.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:40.040
 That's why we can hear, we can detect. If it's solid existence, we can't hear, we can't detect.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:47.040
 According to that teaching, you cannot think. But we can hear that they're empty, echoing.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:56.040
 It's echoing that empty void to empty our senses. And it's said by the empty mind.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:04.040
 Mind, there's no solid. It's all disability. Therefore, this is like echoes.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:11.040
 So, therefore, all, and then all what we see in our conserving pose,

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:17.040
 even though this is a period in our mental status, there's nothing we can detect.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:24.040
 And that you can see, our own pose and concern comes. It's coming one after another.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:29.040
 But where they are? There, there's nothing really we can see.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:33.040
 And we don't follow that. After we follow that, of course, then something continues.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:39.040
 But reality, nothing changes. It's all empty. It will be followed.

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:44.040
 So, the form is an s-merati or the reflection of only the water.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:50.040
 Speech is like echoes, echoes of the emptiness, and mind is the emptiness of the air.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.040
 They're all the conserving pose.

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:55.040
 Therefore, you should see these following ways.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:03.690
 Those are the famous statements in the Gregorian Teacher Buddha's teachings called ten examples of

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:05.040
 the illusions.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:08.040
 Ten examples of illusions are listed here.

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:13.040
 Of course, you have the book. You have the pose. It's the same thing.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:19.040
 Pose is merati. Second is the dreams.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:25.040
 Third is the reflection, reflections or reflection form in the mirrors.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:28.040
 Our image in the mirrors.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:33.040
 And then next one is the reflection in the moon and the water.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:38.040
 Fourth one is the city of the Gandhara, I said.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:42.040
 That is in teaching you that terminology.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:47.040
 But when we are hallucinated by the drops, you see things.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:50.040
 You see, see, see.

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:53.040
 For example, when you take the daturas.

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.040
 We already used that example.

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:59.040
 Datura, then you see things on the space.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:02.040
 Space and the city is all different forms.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:05.040
 Imagine those are called city of the Gandharas.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.040
 It's like city.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.040
 Like city, you can see.

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:11.040
 But reality is just illusions.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.040
 And then muyor.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:16.040
 Muyor is the optical illusions.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:20.040
 Optical illusions due to the maybe disease or whatever.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.040
 And then emanations.

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:25.040
 Emanations maybe you don't see often.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:29.040
 But according to teaching for example, emanation of the Buddhas

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:32.040
 or emanation of those invisible beings.

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:35.040
 It appeared in the right in front of you, maybe some.

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:37.040
 Those some certain public can see those things.

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:40.040
 Said and the reality, they are separate.

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:42.040
 Also there is no poems.

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:43.040
 So those are emanations.

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:45.040
 And then water bubbles.

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.040
 And then echoes.

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:53.040
 Those all are as ten called ten examatories of the illusions

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:56.040
 that great teacher, Buddha told.

00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:00.040
 And only out of all these poems and songs

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:02.040
 everything is a similar thing.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.040
 They are not really different reality.

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.040
 All the same thing.

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.040
 So, so.

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:09.040
 So they are here.

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:11.040
 For this reason, great master, master.

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:21.040
 Therefore, take care or take all that easy as without grasping, clinging.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:23.040
 And take that what that means.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:28.040
 All the poems and all the songs and all the minds, constructions.

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:31.040
 That is, there is so many things in the world.

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.040
 So many things.

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:36.040
 But in the teaching instead you can summarize it into three.

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:41.040
 Three, those are the poems, songs and the space of the mind.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:44.040
 That summarize all everything.

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:50.040
 And so when we are engaging, when we are involved in that,

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:53.040
 not grasping, not clinging.

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:58.040
 And that is also just more instructions in the post meditation too.

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:00.040
 But you need the meditation too.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:03.040
 But even the conceptual thoughts, the arises.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:06.040
 Not holding, grasping or anything.

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.040
 It is all a matter of emptiness.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.040
 All the echoes.

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:13.040
 And the reflection moon in the waters.

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:18.040
 And then he said, and carry the conduct like this.

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:19.040
 That way.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.040
 That way.

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.040
 Without grasping.

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:26.040
 And then the practice, of course, the zuki meditation is so special and wonderful.

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:34.040
 Wonderful, very good.

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:37.040
 Not just hearing times, reading books.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:40.040
 It is a feeling for the intellectual for one time.

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:45.040
 But true realization, the result comes by practices.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:46.040
 Practice.

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:49.040
 So he said, practicing day and the night.

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.040
 And those who have that.

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.040
 Day and the night.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:53.040
 How?

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:56.040
 With practice that day and the night.

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.040
 With joy.

00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:59.040
 With the appreciations.

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.040
 With the creative ones.

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.040
 With the devotions.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.040
 Devotions.

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:04.040
 Really.

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:06.040
 Settle down to the ground.

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.040
 Not lingering consumption.

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:10.040
 At times in different relations.

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:11.040
 This and that things.

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:13.040
 Have to settle down.

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:17.040
 And that's why in the teaching what Karabdol is the second word.

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:23.040
 Particle in a bit.

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.040
 Decising.

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:25.040
 Resolution.

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:28.040
 Making one resolution to the one point.

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:29.040
 Resolution.

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:33.040
 One point resolution to the one single point.

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:37.040
 That means this realization of the river.

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.040
 Zuki meditation.

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.040
 Incompassed everything.

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:42.040
 All the Buddha teachings.

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:45.040
 All the practices.

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:49.040
 All the Vadiyana teachings.

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:52.040
 And suttara teachings.

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:54.040
 Mahayana suttara teachings.

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.040
 All the Panditian suttara teachings.

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:58.040
 All really combined.

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:00.040
 We didn't need to look.

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:01.040
 So there.

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:03.040
 In it a bit.

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:06.040
 One resolution.

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:08.040
 Have confidence.

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:09.040
 Now you see.

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:12.040
 This is the what you need.

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.040
 And then.

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:16.040
 That resolution is not enough.

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:19.040
 Now you have to carry on that.

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:22.040
 Not let that go down to the ditch.

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:23.040
 Ditch.

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:24.040
 Ditch.

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:26.040
 If that happen.

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.040
 Then we not going to follow.

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:31.040
 What we like to follow.

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:33.040
 So keep continuing.

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:34.040
 Here.

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:36.040
 Great Martha say I'm sure you have books.

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.040
 Whenever you have a book that you need.

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:41.040
 See the day and the night.

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:44.040
 That's what the shaka chora himself.

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:47.040
 Meditate day and the night.

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:49.040
 No kimba day and the night.

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.040
 I mean no kimba day.

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.040
 All high capability practices.

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:54.040
 High capability beings.

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:57.040
 No kimba practice day and the night.

00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:00.040
 And malarepa.

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:02.040
 Practice day and night.

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:04.040
 And when Yahu Muhammulchih.

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:06.040
 Great Martha Muhammulchih.

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:07.040
 Always practice.

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:10.040
 Really always separate.

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.040
 All these books what he wrote.

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.040
 All those.

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:15.040
 A rising knowledge.

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:18.040
 It's not just man researches and all these different books.

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:21.040
 And trying to collect and copy them.

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:23.040
 All that he wrote.

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:24.040
 Those books.

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:27.040
 And then many people say that.

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:31.040
 His kimba day here will say chui and as well as her chui.

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:34.040
 When Muhammulchih write those books.

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:36.040
 Not just writing whole things.

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:39.040
 On the beach were the sessions of his practices.

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.040
 He write down.

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:43.040
 And then just completely write.

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:46.040
 And then wherever he stops.

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:48.040
 And then he leave that.

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:49.040
 Until next day.

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:53.040
 And then he bring that back and continue writing.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:55.040
 That's what I really did.

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:57.040
 So Muhammulchih was a practice.

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.040
 All those great masters.

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:02.040
 What we call now great masters.

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:05.040
 Not at the beginning of their great masters.

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:06.040
 Their practice.

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:08.040
 Their great practice.

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:09.040
 Their courage.

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.040
 Their commitment.

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:12.040
 Their devotions.

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:13.040
 To dharma.

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:14.040
 And compassion.

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:15.040
 To all beings.

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.040
 All bodies.

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:17.040
 All beings.

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:19.040
 Is just in measure.

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:20.040
 In enormous.

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:21.040
 Really.

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:22.040
 So powerful.

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:24.040
 That's why that back.

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:28.040
 They become great masters.

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:33.040
 This being great master is not just reserved by the certain peoples.

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:35.040
 We all have that potential.

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:38.040
 We all have that opportunity.

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:41.040
 No one is occupied that opportunity.

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:45.040
 No one is a kind of grab that and talk away from us.

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:47.040
 And we really put that.

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:49.040
 What we need.

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:50.040
 Joy.

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:51.040
 Appreciation.

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:52.040
 Devotions.

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.040
 Devotions.

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:55.040
 And joy forever.

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:57.040
 To the dharma.

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:58.040
 Then we can.

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:02.040
 So he said continue with that.
