00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.780
 "When you look at the overview of the entire everything in the world, everything is really mind,

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:16.000
 for example. What we call in the world, things good for us, things bad to us.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:29.280
 When you think that, who is deciding good for us and good for God or not good? Think about that. It

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.000
's all mind. Mind is making decisions.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.650
 Things are good for us, things are good for that. It's not something from outside coming, I'm good

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.000
 for you, I'm bad for you. It's nothing from outside.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:01:03.490
 It's ultimately one's own decision, one's own compliment. This is mind to others. So, things good

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:12.000
 for us, things bad for us, things to be accepted, things to be rejected. Those are the things.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.700
 So this, again, is mind. Take care of it. This is not just an order or something. Talking is really

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.000
 just, we have to make sure everything is mind.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.120
 And then, for example, in the Buddha's teaching, what Buddha gives first? Teachings. Paul Noble

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.000
 Truth teaches. Paul Noble Truth teaches.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 Is Paul Noble Truth teaching outside? Of course, on the book, read it, but it really is outside.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 That is, again, is mind.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.130
 What are Paul Noble Truth teaches? Paul Noble Truth teaching, suffering truths. So what is, who is

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.000
 experiencing suffering?

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.890
 That truth is truly experiencing suffering or difficulty challenging us. It's our mind, related to

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.000
 the mind, completely.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.770
 And what is the cause of suffering truths? Cause of suffering truths. What's that cause? Again, is

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.000
 that outside?

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:24.130
 No. Cause of suffering truth is all the negative emotions. Negative emotions, ignorance, attachment

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.000
, anger, anger, hate, all that.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 So it's not outside. It's with mind. And then the path truths. Who is following the path?

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 Who is following the path? And such as the five paths. All the book, even the F Noble Paths.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:55.940
 Think of those F Noble Paths. Everything, no matter what the explanation, what it details

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.000
 thoroughly and practically and so clearly, precisely, everything,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.580
 everything, everything comes down, it's all mind. So that means talking about mind again. All is

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.000
 about mind.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:18.100
 So path. And then five paths. Accumulation path, application path, seeing path, meditation path,

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.000
 normal starting path.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:29.940
 Again, if we look up with this mind, it's nothing outside. And then as well as 10 boomies, looks at

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.000
 all those different stages and all these things.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 Again, it's mind. There's nothing else outside. All connected with mind.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:48.330
 Then if you go up in the mind only school, who was it? We learned that. What Buddha said also? All

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.000
 noble children, noble children,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:03.020
 entire this three realm is mind. Three realm is mind. He said, everything, entirely this. Three

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:10.000
 realm, the desire realm, home realm, homeless realm, that is mind.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:17.200
 How that started? As we learned the last time, we've been making many times and you'll know too,

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.000
 this is due to the three habit patterns.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:27.550
 All that started. That habit pattern started from the biggest time. Time we deluded. Time we del

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:28.000
uded.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.250
 Time where the divisions between the Buddha and the Buddha and ourself. That time we started

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.000
 developing.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:48.940
 We carried with the force of our displays and grasping, clinging, holding, and then went on and on,

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.000
 went on and on.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 And then all these things. So it's all mind. This is not just this mind only school.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:05.210
 But from mind only school, all the way to the zoki teaching, everything is mind. That's what here,

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:10.000
 great masters pointing out is all perception of the imperial mind.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:18.160
 All is mind pointing out this. And it is therefore, there's famous thunder called dorty khorki

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.000
 thunder.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 They also said, beyond or beside the mind there is no samsara, there is no nirvana.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 All here. And beside the previous mind, there is no Buddha, no sentient beings.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 So all this, that means samsara display, nirvana display, all that started with this mind.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
 Therefore, mind is so important.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:57.790
 Mind is a jewel of everything, ruler of everything, producer of everything, and mind is experienced

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:01.000
 by mind. Mind back to mind.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 That's how we continually carry. For that reason, in the Buddha teaching, always make it deluded.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 It is all deluded, delusions.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 This delusion is magical display, according to any other teachings.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.040
 If we don't have the grasping, clinging, and we don't begin to suffer with that, it's magical

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.000
 display.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:31.630
 This magical display is never going to end. When you reach the enlightenment, enlightenment time

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:32.000
 will become the Buddha.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 This time, this magical display will become the magical display of enlightenment environments.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 But that time is not really suffering, not stumbling, not clashing each other.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:55.660
 It's all enlightenment. So this is how it is. And then, in the Madam Schools, such as the great

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:57.000
 Master Chaturkati,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:04.210
 all those say, not just everyone, one, from the mind-only school, all the way to the Dokkin,

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:06.000
 everything is really the mind.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 And this great Master said, through the power of mind, created the karmas, karmas, and then created

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 all everything related with that.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 If there's no joy in mind, that is, all the delusions display, karma will be ended.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 That time ended. So this is how.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.820
 And then, when we come to the Vadiyana teachings, such as in another teaching, Vadiyana teaching, V

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:34.000
arko,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
 in the Vadiyana teaching, Mahayava teaching, what is it called?

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:48.000
 Again, it's called three Vadir status. Vadir form, Vadir sound, Vadir mind.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:55.990
 Again, we look this carefully. It's mind. It's only what is described by the mind. It is mind's

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:57.000
 display.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 So it's not something that outside, separate things, it's all side of the mind.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 And then in that Anu-Yoga teaching, what is it called? Three mandalas.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 Mandalas of the Buddha, some in the Badri.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 Mandala of the Buddha, some in the Badar, male or female.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 And their displays, or their emanations.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 Again, it is mind's display of the nature of the mind. All mind.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000
 And in the Dokki teaching, we are going through all its display of the three caayas.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 Three caayas are not outside. Three caayas are within our nature of the mind.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 That again, this great Master pointed out, again and again.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 So therefore, all these things is really nothing but mind.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 And then in the Samsara, we are caught with this, with dualities.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 We are principally, what? In the Samsara, we are caught by the power of mind,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
 such as known as feeling and ideas. These ideas.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:05.000
 Ideas are translated as feeling or ideas can be translated as perceptions too.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:11.000
 These perceptions and ideas are so big, so important.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 It is mind. But when we are clinging, grasping, holding,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:22.000
 this is the powerful engine, powerful tool to rule, run,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:31.000
 and maintain the samsara, a feeling and the ideas or the perceptions.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 And the feeling is so important. The first is so important for us is feeling,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 for the samsara beings. That is immediately important.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 And I am feeling. And among that, of course, there are so many feelings,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 kind of divided according to six senses. But among that, good feelings are important.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 Bad feelings we like to reject, we like to avoid.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
 In order to achieve that, in order to do that, then we struggle.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 Feelings are the number one important in the samsara.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 And when the feeling is a little comfortable, it is just a whole rough feeling.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:18.000
 Then idea is very important. Idea is. That is the belief or the will.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
 Belief, this belief, that belief, this is.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 Nothing externally exists. It is something that out is everything.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 But it is all mental created. Idea is important. So important.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 Idea is more stronger than even the feeling.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
 Feeling, when the feelings are a little comfortable, what is it called?

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 A nice roof on the head and a nice braid to the tummy.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 That is then good for the feelings. That is the feeling.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 But when that is comfortable, idea is so important.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 The belief is important. Then we struggle. We fight.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 That is it. Then all the look to the end of the world,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 most of the disaster, the difficult troubles are coming because of our idea or the belief.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 It is not something really happening, extending, coming here, do this, do that.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 It is all these ideas. That is what in the teachings,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 in the samsara is learned by the true, the feeling and the ideal of the resurgence.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 And through that, what is called? Don't create the calmness.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
 Then all the acting back and forth.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 All that is as like interdependent, ordinary, related to each other and running through,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000
 and maintaining, recycling, and reactivating, and moving,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
 again, ignite, and then all these thoughts.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:49.000
 So fundamentally, again, looking, this all starts with the mind.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:56.000
 Feeling is the mind. Perception, the idea or the belief is the mind.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.000
 That's the hope. And therefore, now we like to go beyond that turbulence,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:11.000
 beyond that turbulence, beyond that horizons, beyond that thunderstorms.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 And then behind that what? Behind that is empty.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 Even the perception or even the feeling and this idea of belief,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 if you look, is empty. There is no substantial solid existing anything.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 And for this reason, great masters here said, in some other teachings,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 because it is produced by mind. Mind is empty.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:51.000
 There is no solid existing mind. Therefore, what even displays the mind is empty.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 The only one is a mistake. We grasp it. We cling it.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 We act with that grasp and cling it. Then we get the consequence.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 That's the whole topic. So this is what this great master is pointing out.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
 One after another, because I said so many times, when we meditate,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:17.000
 we need confidence. We need courage. We need confidence.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:23.000
 Confidence is certainty's wisdom. Certainty's wisdom brings confidence.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
 Because you see, that's the truth. There is nothing to linger,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 nothing to hesitate, nothing to pull back. It is high habit.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 And then with that confidence, we need courage.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000
 Courage, as I said, we are changing the course of the habit pattern

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 that carried so many lifetimes. Until now, we are changing that.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 It is not always easy, not always simple.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 Sometimes it's challenging, but it's a courage and commitment.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
 That's why also in the Buddha teaching, what's called bodhisattvas.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
 Sattva means courageous. Courage is one for the enlightenment.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:09.000
 That's why it's also called warriors, a worship for the enlightenment.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 Breathe really for the enlightenment.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
 Breathe joy, and bring up love and compare your kindness.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
 It's also not easy. It's not easy, not simple.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 Bring that God, bring back that. Therefore courage and commitment.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 If we know the value and the importance and need of that,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 then stand tall and firm and strong with that realization.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 That is known as courageous one's enlightenment.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000
