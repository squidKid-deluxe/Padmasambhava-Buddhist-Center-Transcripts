NOTE     "synopsis": "On August 1, 2015 at Padma Samye Ling during the Dzogchen Summer Retreat on Lama Shabkar's \"Golden Needle,\" a student asked for an explanation of the \"five wisdoms\" in Tibetan Buddhism, and how they are related to the \"five poisons\" of ignorance, attachment, anger, jealousy, and pride.\n\nThe five wisdoms (Tib. \u0f61\u0f7a\u0f0b\u0f64\u0f7a\u0f66\u0f0b\u0f63\u0f94\u0f0b, yeshe nga; Wyl. ye shes lnga) are five aspects of primordial wisdom (Tib. \u0f61\u0f7a\u0f0b\u0f64\u0f7a\u0f66\u0f0b, yeshe). They are:\n\n1. dharmadhatu wisdom\n2. mirror-like wisdom\n3. equanimity wisdom\n4. discrimination awareness wisdom\n5. all-accomplishing wisdom\n\nWatch Khenpo Rinpoche's beautiful answer to this very important question on how to bring out clarity in one's meditation.\n\nwww.padmasambhava.org",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.720
 Dharmadhatu wisdom and ignorance are transcendent in the dharmadhatu wisdom.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:17.400
 Dharmadhatu wisdom is pervasive, pervasive in all territories.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:30.520
 It is the best of all four wisdom, all four wisdom such as equanimity wisdom, discrimination

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:38.680
 awareness wisdom, mirror-like wisdom, all the accomplished wisdom come from dharmadhatu

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:52.760
 wisdom, is dharmadhatu wisdom. And then mirror-like wisdom, mirror-like wisdom means that wisdom,

00:00:52.760 --> 00:01:01.480
 dharmadhatu wisdom is, is like mirror, mirror, what mirror? Of course it's a metaphor too.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:10.440
 What mirror does? Mirror, reference, everything in the mirror, there's whatever is on the way,

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:20.040
 or on that direction, mirror captures everything. And similarly, this wisdom, dharmadhatu wisdom,

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:31.160
 this wisdom captures everything, everything in the, on the surface of, ever used the surface of,

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:38.600
 it's not in the surface, but it reflect to dharmadhatu, all that as a mirror, use the example of a

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:49.400
 mirror, so it reflects everything. So that is mirror-like wisdom if used. And then the equanimity

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:56.360
 wisdom means what? Equanimity is equal, everything is equal, equal. That's I think the

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.840
 equanimity in a niche more. And the debate is called the nyam-i, nyapani. That means even though

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:13.640
 in that mirror there's so many things that reflect it, reflect it, so many things that reflect it,

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:22.120
 in that mirror level there's no discriminations, it's all equal, it's just all equal, equal.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.960
 There's nothing based on that kind of, high and low, based on good and bad, anything,

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:37.800
 it's just all reflected is equal, equal. So that is really meaning of the equanimity wisdom.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:45.880
 And the next one is a discrimination awareness wisdom. Right? Discrimination awareness wisdom.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:55.000
 That means now in the mirror shine all those things, all those things in reflect in the mirror,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.120
 and also it show everything is in equal status. Everything looks like, kind of like, it's good,

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:09.720
 jumbo mumbo. Jumbo mumbo, everything is, that kind of, it's all there. But this discrimination

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:16.360
 awareness is not going to make the jumbo mumbo. It's going to see everything so precisely, clearly,

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:22.520
 exactly as it is. If it's white, it's white, it's big, it's big, it's small, it's small,

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:31.480
 just detailed, thorough, precise, everything clearly seeing that it is. And that aspect of the

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:45.560
 wisdom that is known as all discrimination awareness wisdom. And now the fifth one

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:53.240
 is all accomplished wisdom. All accomplished wisdom because of understanding of everything

00:03:53.240 --> 00:04:01.160
 so precise and so clean and so beautiful as it is. Therefore, then all, whatever things need to do,

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:06.440
 will accomplish it. Because not so precise and so clean, there is no room for ignorance, or there

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.600
 is

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:14.440
 no ignorance at all. In this world, we have many times sometimes performed, sometimes not performed

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.440
,

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:20.920
 successful, not self. Why? Because of the ignorance. And we don't have the ignorance, we will do

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:21.080
 the

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:26.710
 perfectly, perfectly beautiful, we think should need to do to, to fulfill that. But because we don

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.920
't,

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:33.880
 every most activity of ours are in presumptions. You know, that's what's called hopeless. Hopeless

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:34.120
ness.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.240
 But here, no need to hop on it. And clearly, understand precisely,

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:46.440
 exactly as it is, is, and they are accomplishing. Because of that wisdom, they are accomplishing

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.440
 all the activities. Okay, so that's the video.
