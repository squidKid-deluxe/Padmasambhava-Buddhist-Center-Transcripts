00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.100
 In practice, what we are practicing? In practice, as in English history, practice makes perfect,

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.000
 perfect.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.380
 By this method, it is going to perform the perfect practice, perfectness, perfectness in the

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.000
 richness of the natures.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.500
 Both external, internal, and that is also external, means this universal world.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:31.440
 Internal means our physicals too, and then our mind is all going to pray, that richness, splendid

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.500
 qualities,

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:40.500
 the beauty that he held, that complete, and that in this "sadhana" is what?

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.500
 "Sadhana" is come from where?

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:51.600
 It condenses the instructions of the tantras. That's true. "Dhantara" is sadhana that comes from

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.500
 already.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:59.500
 "Dhantara." And what means the meaning of "dhantara"? Again, the word meaning of "dhantara."

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:19.950
 What? "Continue." "Dhantara." What? What? Like a weaving. We, we, we, who, who is that? That's it.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:20.500
 And then anything?

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:28.860
 "Threat." "Threat" is true. That's really woven. "Threat." Those also, this is the meaning of "dh

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:29.500
antras."

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.500
 "Dhantras," and then also the meaning of "dhantra," means always it.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.700
 "Dhantra" has the word meaning of the "trat." "Trat." "Trat," what means? "Trat" is the same

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.500
 meaning as the "tarah."

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:52.500
 "Tara" means what? For example, the word "tarah." "Tara." "Lady tarah."

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:59.500
 "Liberator." That's "liberator." "Tara" is translated into the word, what's called the "dharma."

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.500
 "Dharma." "Dharma" means "liberating." "Liberating."

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:13.720
 So "dhantra" has the word, also "tarah." "Tara" is liberating. Then, as I said, it's woven or

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.500
 continuation.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.500
 Continues. What means continuation?

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.500
 "On the mind." What?

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.500
 "A continuation of the mind."

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:32.500
 That's it. That's it. Continuations of the nature of the mind.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.500
 It's the nature of the mind.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.500
 The duality of the mind is temporary. It's not going to continue.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:47.500
 But the absolute nature of the mind, the "tathagadagadam," the Buddha's nature, is continuation.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:57.500
 So why is that this "tathat" is named like that? Well, it is teaching is named like that.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:04.980
 That always in the teaching says, because that continuation will be reworked by these "tathat"

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:05.500
 teachers.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:14.500
 That absolute continuation, unbroken system that wager a chain, wager the thread and woven,

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.500
 that will be reworked by these "tathas."

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:28.200
 That how this is going to be reworked, then this is the "sadhana." "Sadhana" is the essence of that

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.500
 teaching that well.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:37.860
 Otherwise, "tathara" is so big. Of course, maybe it's a certain highly intelligent individual can

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:38.500
 understand that.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.500
 But mostly, every different word, "tathara" is very big.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:49.610
 "Tathara" is very big and difficult to mean. No exhalities. It's like more kind of like physics

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:50.500
 words.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.500
 Words of physics, we won't understand easily.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:04.710
 But this "sadhana" will help to bring that essence and bring to rework the continuation of the

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.500
 radial natures.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.500
 So that, therefore, "sadhana" is very important.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:22.500
 In order to activate this "sadhana," this meaning, then this "choga" or "chagli."

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.500
 "Chagli," that you don't know. "Chagli" is the word of all, is ritual.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.500
 Ritual is important, then ritual is important.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:40.020
 Because ritual is, what's called, in Gurbakama Sambha said, in the Mundu teaching, "sadhana" or Rom

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.500
elukana Sanabji said,

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:50.500
 "if you combine the ritual with Vadiyana teaching, it brings the precious blessings."

00:04:50.500 --> 00:05:00.500
 "Blessings" or it brings the precious, the energetic things. It will bring that.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:08.500
 It brings uplifting our things. We're not just sinking, we're uplifting, we're outgoing, going.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.500
 And therefore, then this ritual is important.

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:19.900
 All this ritual implementation, everything we do, it becomes something magnificent to call that

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.500
 really encompasses entirely what it is.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:31.500
 What is there or what is here, that will be revealed. So therefore, "choga," "chagli" is important.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.500
 The chagli, "choga" is important.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:40.500
 And then, how to learn this ritual? There's two ways.

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:47.500
 This is known as ritual. You learn with linear instructions, that what we're following.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:55.860
 But at the same time, being there, being part of the mandala, being there, part of the ceremony,

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.500
 being part of the group.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:05.020
 Combination, you will learn. Not just intellectually, when you be in a group, you're activating, in

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.500
 a way, your knowledge.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:13.500
 So it becomes real, not just as an imagination status, but really look at that.

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:22.500
 That's what we learn. Therefore, this is what's called "suchoga," "chagli," "chagli," that's it.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:45.500
 So those are really the kind of overview of the mandala and sort of moral of the ritual.

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:46.070
 And then, of course, you will learn from me. It will be reminded by our lamas to you, and you will

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:47.500
 all become who you know already and do this.

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:52.960
 This is really, as I said, it's really important to practice. When we're practicing at home, when

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.500
 you're practicing with the Guru,

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:59.500
 and we practice with confidence, we practice with confidence.

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:04.550
 All that I don't know, I'm a part of the group, but there's something, many things that happen, I

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:05.500
 don't understand.

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:12.500
 We don't have to fill that kind of twilight zone. So we really see that really things.

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:19.600
 We practice with confidence, diligently, joyful, we devote and build each other at home, in the

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.500
 heaven, in the Guru,

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:27.500
 and that's the living purpose of the learning, which will become part of the lineage system,

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:36.160
 that long-lasting continuation from the "Buddha Shakyamuni" or the "Vedyadara" to "Murban Masambha"

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:36.500
 to "Nah."

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:41.500
 So that is the brilliant meaning of the ritual. Thank you.

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:48.500
 Thank you. Now we do one minute meditation, and then we are here to pray.
