00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440
 Remember, when I was young, father always talked something in Tibetan local, that kind of he used

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:14.800
 to talk particularly when there is a big celebration of the party and the wedding ceremonies and so

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.000
 forth.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.870
 Then in the local villages, kind of talks about the long story, every item, they talk about big,

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.000
 large, princey stories.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:37.690
 And about the kaka, and the father used to say, he said, "Even before the cosmic begins, before the

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:43.000
 cosmic, because there is a queen of cosmics."

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:57.830
 And she thought we had to have something beautiful to begin the cosmos. Therefore, she immediately

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.000
 emanated beautiful young girls.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 These young girls are like, what's it called? Weber? Weber? Weaving? Who does the public? Weber.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:22.530
 And these beautiful young girls came and they are so smart. And then they started immediately

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.000
 spanning the public.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:34.340
 What's the name of this wedding? It's a yearning. A start of the yearning and then they started

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.000
 making the public.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.370
 I need to wait. I'm sure it's ancient time here, too. They don't have the machines. Each

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:51.000
 individually kind of stays behind the yearning things and they didn't make that.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:01.440
 So then she, these ladies are made beautiful, that public scarf. And the first one came, the white

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.000
 one.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 White one. And it's so beautiful. It's shiny, sparkling, and rainbow light. Rainbow light.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:21.820
 And then immediately she offered to the lady of cosmics. And she picked up and threw in the sky and

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.000
 named as kata.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:33.480
 Kata means individuals. Kata means mode. Dal means prosperity. So mode of faith. Wherever you turn

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:40.000
 with the kata, that direction will become so prosperity and peace and good things.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 So therefore it's kata. And so she named as kata. This is beautiful.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.890
 Beautiful. Wherever you turn your head with the kata, then everything will become so bright and

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.000
 beautiful.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 Ever since this kata became very significant of the archbethals and broader spirit.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:10.040
 So she said even the evolution, before the evolutions, evolutions, just the queen of cosmic thought

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.000
 to create the cosmic.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 And that time, the first item was kata. And kata, and this is so archbethal.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 In the sense of that, then kata becomes so important to everyone, every part of the celebrations.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:32.210
 We do religious ceremony or the Buddhist ceremony. Kata is necessary, always comes first to lead

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.000
 and open the door.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.210
 And when there is celebration of the secular, again kata is first. And it opens the door and

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:43.000
 everything harmonizes and beautiful.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:51.980
 Therefore, kata is so special all the time. And kata symbolizes friendship, good, goodness and arch

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.000
bethals.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:04.120
 And it is pure, clean, white as my heart or your heart. We are bonded with beautiful, stainless

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.000
 space of beautiful love and trust.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 So those are the many meanings of the kata. And since then, that's the father of music.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 He may be more fancy, there's a lot of lyrics and all these things he uses. But I forget, so that's

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 it.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 But then it really becomes so popular and it's very custom. Everywhere the kata is true.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.270
 Always use the white kata. And then many later on, they're coded with very un-teaching and used in

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.000
 his five different colors that symbolize different elements and so forth.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:47.970
 But white is always as a substitute here as flowers, flowers and furniture, greeting, happiness and

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.000
 good wishes and good things.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 So that is my brief story of kata.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:07.150
 So this is the question, even before the cosmos, that the father came in. And then cosmic begins

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.000
 after that, by the cosmic.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:22.040
 It really is the super-coron, super-yamu-yamu. Yamu-yamu is like the queen of one of the greatest

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.000
 inspirations to everywhere.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 That's it, as a super-coron, super-yamu-yamu is also. And then she wanted all that.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 That's it.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 Okay, thank you everyone. Thank you, thank you.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 Now please continue, for all the differences.
