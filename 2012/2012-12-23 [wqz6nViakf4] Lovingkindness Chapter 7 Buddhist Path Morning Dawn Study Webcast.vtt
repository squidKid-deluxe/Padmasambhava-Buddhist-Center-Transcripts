NOTE     "synopsis": "On December 7, 2012 at Padma Samye Ling, the local sangha recorded the seventh PBC Morning Dawn Study Group webcast where they discussed Chapter 7 of The Buddhist Path by the Venerable Khenpo Rinpoches, entitled \"Loving-kindness.\"\n\nThree Main Topics Being Discussed:\n\n1. \"Typically, at the present time, we love only a few people\u2014ourselves, our family, and our close friends. This limited notion of love is an ordinary emotion. The love between two people is part of the love and com- passion we are talking about, but this form of love is based on attachment and clinging. The immeasurable love of bodhichitta is based on emptiness. Since infinite love is combined with equanimity, it is not an emotion.\" (pg 37, 3rd paragraph)\n\n2. \"When you generate bodhichitta, you will be happy about what you are doing. There are two reasons for this happiness: first, you are actualizing bodhichitta within yourself, and second, you are engaged in working for all beings. Among the many different thoughts you have every day, the thought of enlightenment is the most important. As you develop this thought and increase it to include all the sentient beings who are in need, it will bring great joy because what you are doing is so special. Attaining enlightenment for the benefit of others is the best activity you can do in this life. All sentient beings will join you in rejoicing because you are dedicating your activities for their benefit.\" (pg 38, 2nd full paragraph)\n\n3. \"When Buddha Shakyamuni taught the benefits of relative bodhichitta, he said that ultimately it results in enlightenment, and relatively it brings eight special results. The first of these is that your body and mind remain relaxed and joyful. The second result of practicing love and compassion is freedom from illness; disease cannot attack you. The third is protection from external attacks through weapons. The fourth is protection from poison\u2014if somebody gives you poison or if you accidentally take poison, it will not kill you. The fifth result is that you will be greatly appreciated by everyone, not only human beings but nonhuman beings as well. The sixth is that you will be protected by the buddhas and bodhisattvas \u2014 the realized beings who have already developed bodhichitta. The seventh benefit is that you will be reborn in the higher realms. The eighth is that all of your wishes will be spontaneously fulfilled; you will achieve whatever you desire without difficulty.\" (pg 39, 1st and 2nd full paragraphs)\n\n\nImportant Concepts and Terms:\n\nfour immeasurables [Tib. tshad med bzhi; Skt. catva\u0304ryapramanani]. The \"four immeasurables\" or \"four boundless states\" are infinite (1) \"love\" [byams pa], (2) \"compassion\" [snying rje], (3) \"sympathetic joy\" [dga' ba], and (4) \"equanimity\" [btang snyoms]. Cultivating these qualities is an important part of any Maha\u0304ya\u0304na path.\n\n\nPBC YouTube Videos of the Venerable Khenpo Rinpoches for Further Study \n \nMingling Practice with Daily Life \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSIXtGXB-cc\n\nOn April 19, 2011 in Vajrakilaya and Medicine Buddha Temple at Padma Samye Ling, Venerable Khenpo Rinpoche continued his teachings on H.H. Dudjom Rinpoche's Mountain Retreat Instructions by reminding us how to bring the essence of the Dharma into our lives.\n\nTo download the pdf of all the Main Topics, Concepts, and PBC YouTube Videos to refer to for this PBC Morning Dawn Study Webcast, go to the main \"Padmasambhava Buddhist Center\" Facebook page: www.padmasambhava.org/facebook\n\nPadma Samye Ling\n618 Buddha Highway\nSidney Center, NY 13839\n(607) 865-8068\nwww.padmasambhava.org\n\nFor more information on the PBC Morning Dawn Study Program:\nmorningdawn@padmasambhava.org",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.260
 Happy Holidays! Welcome to the seventh broadcast of the PBC Morning Dawn Study

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.560
 Group at Padmasami Ling. Today we'll be discussing Chapter 7 from the Venerable

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:16.120
 Khenpo Rinpoches book, "The Buddhist Path," which is called "Loving-kindness." So first

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.920
 we'll do opening prayers like usual, and then we'll begin the discussion. Thanks

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.240
 so much.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 [Singing in Hindi]

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:10.840
 The supreme tradition of the glorious Buddha Padmasambhava, which is the essential extraordinary

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.080
 view and doctrine of the early translation school. You keep alive and spread by the light

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.760
 of wisdom. Lord of Dharma, great Khenpo, and pray at your lowly seat. In the palace of

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.160
 the ogum in Dharma Daptu, the essence of all the Buddhas of the three times, the one who

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:33.080
 chose clearly the Dharmakaya of my own mind, who prayed to the Honorable Raghuram, "Lorraine's

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.400
 true teacher, precious one, dwelling on the loaded seat in the crown of my head. Hold

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.480
 me with your great kindness and bestow the accomplishments of body, speech, and mind."

00:01:44.480 --> 00:02:12.880
 [Singing in Hindi]

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:30.840
 Thanks. So then in the beginning of Chapter 7, which begins page 37, this "Loving-kindness,"

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:37.320
 a quick overview. The first Venerable Kimberimache says that once you have the thought to attain

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.600
 enlightenment, then the next step is to increase that motivation to attain enlightenment as

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:48.480
 much as possible, and then to wish for everyone to generate bodhicitta. And for those who

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.320
 have already generated bodhicitta, for them to continue generating bodhicitta as much

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:59.240
 as possible. And then they go on to say that compassion is based on loving-kindness and

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:04.200
 that once you have love for others, you don't want to hurt them. And with the measurable

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:10.480
 love, you will always treat all beings as your loved ones. And then now, we are more

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:17.320
 or less love only a few people, and it's mainly based on attachment. But immeasurable love

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:23.000
 is different from this. It's based on recognition and understanding of emptiness, and thus it

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.040
 becomes an immeasurable love. So then we'll go to this first topic point we'll talk about.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:36.760
 Typically, at the present time, we love only a few people, ourselves, our family, our close

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.840
 friends. This limited notion of love is an ordinary emotion. The love between two people

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.680
 is part of the love and compassion we are talking about, but this form of love is based

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:54.200
 on attachment and clinging. The immeasurable love of bodhicitta is based on emptiness. Since

00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:00.200
 infinite love is combined with equanimity, it is not an emotion. It's page 37, third

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:13.280
 paragraph. I was thinking about this week, we kind of discussed it a little bit last

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:19.760
 session when we were talking about bodhicitta. I mean, just how Rinpoche's are talking about

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:28.680
 here, how referring to love, like our ordinary love, like what we might feel for our girlfriend

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:37.000
 or boyfriend or whatever, or just another person. And I just thought, I mean, it just

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.680
 seems like an interesting subject to just think about more, that thing, how everybody

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:49.620
 experiences love somehow, in some way, it's like so apparent to us. And then here it is

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:56.840
 also when it's, but it's limited, just to look at that difference between limited love

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:02.280
 and then this like limitless love. And then just thinking about, too, like this thing

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:09.880
 of, you know, the empty nature of things and equanimity and how that kind of transforms

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:16.240
 everything. But I don't know, it's not really a question, but just kind of, it seems like

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:22.600
 that bridge between this limit, limitation, and not like necessarily, obviously, love

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.600
 is lovely. We don't want to reject our love for others, but just like this whole practice

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:33.600
 of expanding and not grasping so much, just wondering what other people kind of thought

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:40.600
 around that general area of actually actualizing that, you know? Or would it?

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.600
 Yeah, I was just wondering about that last sentence, "since infinite love is combined

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:50.600
 with equanimity, it is not an emotion." I wasn't sure why that made it not an emotion,

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:57.600
 because you're not feeling it, or like in the same way as you would for a parent, or

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:04.600
 something like that. Why is it that combined with equanimity is not an emotion?

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:09.600
 I think this is a particular translation issue, too, I think, because oftentimes they say

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:15.600
 emotion free from emotion. And I think often there's really a distinction between negative

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:23.600
 or afflictive emotions, and then positive or natural emotions. I think there really is

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:28.600
 a little translation issue there, that afflictive emotions come from when we're tied and grasping,

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:33.600
 eco-clinging, or have a particular something in mind that we're trying to get with a very

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.600
 limited view. And so then any emotion we would have, whether it's something we're trying

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:42.600
 to pull towards us or push away, then that would be afflictive, meaning based on grasping.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.600
 And that a positive goodness quality or a natural emotion, they say here that that love

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:53.600
 between two people, or that that is like a little window into our bodhicitta, this larger

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:59.600
 vast or unlimited bodhicitta, or this goodness nature qualities. But that when we're connected

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:05.600
 to that bodhicitta, or that nature, or that emptiness nature, that this arising capacity

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:10.600
 is naturally loving, compassionate, and kind, and that that would be considered a positive

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:16.600
 emotion, like a positive expression of that. So then to say just free of emotion, sometimes

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:22.600
 it seems like, oh, just zombie-like, or oh, I want to be free of emotion. And everyone

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:30.600
 says, I don't want that because that doesn't seem so fun. Yeah. There's no distinction.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:36.600
 So you think that it's really, that it's not an afflictive emotion? I think so.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:43.600
 Or an emotion based on just like this cliche of consciousness or whatever, this dualistic

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:49.600
 belief in, you know, it's seeing the emptiness nature, I think. And the reason why I could

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:57.600
 be vast and impartial and valorous and immeasurable is because it's not just taking, you know,

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:02.600
 a narrow, limited perspective that myself is real, everyone else is real, and therefore

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:07.600
 within that spectrum, you have preferences for it.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:14.600
 I kind of like the idea of thinking about the emptiness as without boundary, you know,

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:21.600
 kind of like without drawing lines around like me and you, or like this, you know, community,

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:26.600
 and there's kind of like these borders or boundaries, and like the emptiness is really

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:33.600
 just that totally open without any of those boundaries like that, that love that you share

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:38.600
 with one person, with a few people that like just really like working to extend that, like

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:44.600
 beyond all, you know, because they're just concepts anyway, just conceptual notions of

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:52.600
 me and you and us and this country and all those, it's just totally a, you know, it's

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:57.600
 just a figment or, you know, it's illusory, those lines that we draw on our minds of the

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:03.600
 map of the world, you know, so just really kind of pushing that, it's like expanding

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:04.600
 and expanding.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:09.600
 And it seems too there's that also, there's that expansiveness and then there's also that

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:16.600
 part of the clarity, like even in a relationship with one person, when there isn't so much

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:22.600
 grasping and like totally holding ourselves to be a certain way or a certain thing and

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:27.600
 that person to be a certain way and behave a certain way, but to really like that part

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:33.600
 of love where we see just really clearly see the beautiful qualities and even more than

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:41.600
 that, just know there's no or whatever, have trust or just that when there's not so much

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:47.600
 clutching or holding on, there's that openness and the same time there's like that, that

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:52.600
 clarity aspect, which of course, I mean, that's a term we always use a lot with the clarity

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:59.600
 and emptiness, but even just in that sense of like how even in one to one with one person,

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:04.600
 not to mention infinite limitless sentient beings, you know, but just even that the way

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:10.600
 beginning with one person kind of where we can really appreciate the beautiful qualities

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:17.600
 and see them clearly and but yet not, not be so restricted or thinking that, oh, this

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:23.600
 person is only this one way or they, you know, and there's lots of ways it can go, but that

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:30.600
 clarity aspect of like clearly seeing what it is we love and just not the way that's

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:37.600
 so smooth and kind of just vivid and it does kind of seem to have a feeling of expanding

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:47.600
 and more easily breathes, you know, with everything and allows room for growing.

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:52.600
 I think that's a really big point there. I mean, both are what you both said that one

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:58.600
 is there's no fixed boundary. So we can love one person and two and three and like really

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:05.600
 are feeling our sense of appreciating and honoring someone else can really include everyone.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:10.600
 But at the same time, there's a really there is a clarity about what we appreciate. Like

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:15.600
 there, it's not that there's no boundaries, meaning, oh, everyone's I'll treat everyone

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:19.600
 like my little brother or something because I really love him. And so just kind of have

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:25.600
 that same relationship with everyone is really specifically appreciating specific things

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:31.600
 about different people that everyone has this Buddha nature, but it's manifesting in such

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:37.600
 unique, really special ways differently for different people. So where there's on the

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:42.600
 one side, more of the emptiness side, there's this inclusivity to really see this this openness

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:49.600
 to include more and to honor more and less tight fixed way. But at the same time, it's

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:55.600
 really appreciating the detailed expressions that we all bring. So there's not this general

00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:00.600
 sometimes it's like, well, I have to love everyone equally. Well, that means I can't

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:05.600
 love my mom as much. Or I have to love everyone like I love my mom. Like how does it work

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:11.600
 practically, but it doesn't have to be the same role that we put everyone into. It's

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:18.600
 more like that inclusivity, but then a very unique, specific way of appreciating and loving.

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:25.600
 That's really important to see both that clarity side and the openness. And it seems to I mean,

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:31.600
 it's just always interesting, you know, with the, the four boundless, like before, you know,

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:39.600
 the four aspirational aspects of bodhicitta, right, is often how they're in the lineage

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:44.600
 they're referred to, but that it's just, I think it's interesting the way like there's

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:50.600
 the traditional order of like here, and how even Rinpoche is referred here, how compassion

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:57.600
 is based on loving kindness in life. And then, of course, and there's rejoice, the rejoicing

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:03.600
 aspects, and then equanimity. And it's interesting. I mean, here, when we're talking about loving

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:09.600
 kindness, let that something as an ordinary being, like myself, I mean, that's something

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:15.600
 we can easily refer to something somewhere, I think everybody can refer to that loving

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:21.600
 kindness. And then there's this deeper aspect, like you know, Patra Rinpoche, it's just part

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:29.600
 of the Buddha's teachings, how it's the equanimity, the boundless equanimity that makes all the

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:36.600
 you know, the rest boundless and open or like Rinpoche is here not, not an affliction, because

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:42.600
 it's not limited. So it's interesting how the Buddha, it's like equanimity, equanimity

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:48.600
 comes last, and yet it's the thing that makes all the four boundless, boundless and immeasurable

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:58.600
 and endless and really close, close, closer to, you know, keeping that view and then helping

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:02.600
 us actualize it. And then yet, and then at the same time, the Buddha starts with like

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:08.600
 this practice of just connecting with loving kindness, because it seems like it is, it's

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:15.600
 something everyone can relate to, to some degree, and then grow from there. Just interesting,

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:21.600
 just like generosity is like the first paramita. And of course, it's like the prajnaparamita,

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:28.600
 the wisdom paramita that makes all the paramitas like really transcendent. But yeah, it's kind

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:36.600
 of just this thought of generosity is the first paramita in a way. This is the way the Buddha

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:41.600
 gave that. I mean, I'm not saying I know why the Buddha did anything, but, but just how

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:49.600
 that, that object of actually giving and an open and generous heart and mind and is kind

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:56.600
 of definitely a first step towards actualizing a bodhicitta too, which maybe that kind of,

00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:01.600
 I don't know, unless there's more to say about that, maybe we should move to the next kind

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:02.600
 of area.

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:06.600
 Yes, and then we can just kind of pull together ideas and people will have things to say about

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:12.600
 the first one too. So in this, in the second section of this chapter, Ramachas are making

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:18.600
 the point that everyone wants to be happy and no one wants to suffer. And that with love,

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:23.600
 we can actually help other people find happiness and experience that happiness that everyone

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:29.600
 wants. And then they go on to talk about the next Buddha, Buddha Maitreya of this fortunate

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:35.600
 eon that his name means loving kindness. It's Maitreya, Maitreya. And then he became a Buddha

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:41.600
 by practicing only one technique. And that was this same technique of loving kindness.

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:47.600
 And so with love, we'll also develop the capacity to be patient with others with the difficulties

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:52.600
 in changing circumstances. And that if we don't have patience now, that really what we

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:58.600
 need to cultivate is love. And then they say, Ramachas say that when we generate bodhicitta

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:05.600
 we'll become happy. And that we'll be actualizing our own bodhicitta then. And then also working

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:10.600
 to benefit other beings at that same time. And so that attaining enlightenment for the

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:15.600
 benefit of others, they also make this point which is really strong. Attaining enlightenment

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:20.600
 for the benefit of others is the best thing that we can do in this life. And we should

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:26.600
 try to expand this loving attitude without expecting anything in return. And that we

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:32.600
 can mentally even give our own happiness to others and take on their suffering on to ourselves.

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:39.600
 And this is called exchanging self and others and related to this practice of Tomlun. So

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:44.600
 that's this second section of this chapter. And would someone like to read this second

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:53.600
 point? May I answer you either? Sure. When you generate bodhicitta you'll be happy about

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:59.600
 what you're doing. There are two reasons for this happiness. First, you're actualizing

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:05.600
 bodhicitta within yourself. And second, you're engaged in working for all beings. Among the

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:11.600
 many different thoughts you have every day, the thought of enlightenment is the most important.

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:15.600
 As you develop this thought and increase it to include all the sentient beings who are

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:21.600
 in need, it will bring great joy because what you're doing is so special. Attaining

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:26.600
 enlightenment for the benefit of others is the best activity you can do in this life.

00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:30.600
 All sentient beings will join you in rejoicing because you are dedicating your activities

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:37.600
 for their benefit. That's page 38, the second, full paragraph.

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:53.600
 I always, when I first read this, I thought that when I say of all the thoughts you have

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:59.600
 in your day, the constant thoughts of all the bodhicitta is the most important. When I

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:15.600
 say it, no buts about it. It's the most important but. I just thought that was it. Wow. I thought

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:20.600
 something similar today that sometimes we have such this wealth of dharma teachings

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:27.600
 and instructions and practices and books we've read. And I thought of the ancient times in

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:32.600
 Tibet where people would have to travel so far to see their teacher and receive one teaching

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:37.600
 once and then they travel back and maybe not even see that teacher again their whole life.

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:42.600
 But it's almost like receiving an instruction that's so clear like that. Bodhicitta is the

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:47.600
 most important thought. That sometimes even if we just really keep something simple and

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:55.600
 really kind of go into just one thing, one idea, one technique, it really like that seems

00:18:55.600 --> 00:19:00.600
 like and I agree it seems like one of those striking his instruction techniques that we

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:04.600
 could really if we resonate with that and really hold that in our heart it seems like

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:13.600
 really we can go really far. It's just such a sweet wonderful thing reading about bodhicitta

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:19.600
 and let me kind of like you think about it's just not so surprising in a way like it's

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:25.600
 so common because it's so common that we all want to be happy that all beings like wish

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:32.600
 for happiness and love like it's just obviously obviously because it's not obvious to most

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:38.600
 people but I mean just when you just reflect on that for a little bit of course like everyone

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:43.600
 loves that you know and when you feel love for someone else and it's reciprocated or

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:48.600
 like a group you know it's just like so warm and magnetizing and everyone everyone's happy

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:56.600
 so I mean it's just it's really beautiful teaching. Yeah I thought it was important

00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:03.600
 to just this is kind of related to the first one but also on this dynamic between impartial

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:09.600
 meaning like on the absolute level and the relative meaning the specific you know interaction

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:17.600
 with people as individuals that we can actually interact with not in an abstract way but on

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:25.600
 the one hand it's like on the one hand bodhicitta has to do totally with ourselves like I think

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:30.600
 it's really important even though shanti jiva said all happiness without exception comes

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:37.600
 from others all suffering with us do what comes from thinking of others and all unhappiness

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:41.600
 comes from or suffering comes from thinking of ourselves but I think it's so important

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:47.600
 to realize that like the other people aren't like say you have a relationship with somebody

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:52.600
 and there's love there it's not that the other person is giving you that love if you think

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:57.600
 that love is just the other person's like the love you have for them just comes from

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:02.600
 the other person then of course when that falls apart it's a total disaster no more

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:08.600
 love love is gone you know now it's a nightmare you know that's the exact opposite of bodhicitta

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:14.600
 like the love is when you recognize in yourself to a certain extent that like those beautiful

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:21.600
 qualities that that other people bring out in you because you stop searching you know

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:25.600
 it's like in a certain sense you stop looking for something and twisting things and trying

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:30.600
 to get what you want so much you recognize those qualities and then you just relax from

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:36.600
 it and you enjoy and that's so I don't know so in that one hand bodhicitta which is related

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:41.600
 with another point that Rinpoche is saying if you find yourself getting really impatient

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:46.600
 with people and this and that it's not that they're making you that way it's that you

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:53.600
 yourself can need to cultivate more of that bodhicitta from your own side so in that perspective

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:59.600
 it doesn't have anything to do with other people giving you something that you don't

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:06.600
 have it has to do with connecting with those qualities that are innate in you but otherwise

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:11.600
 you always think you're getting somebody else is going to do it for you the next relationship

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:17.600
 or the next you know they made me so angry you know and the impartiality comes in with

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:24.600
 like that view of emptiness and recognizing that that's your nature you know that's their

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:30.600
 nature that's your nature but and then I just got one more point which is really important

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:35.600
 this doesn't mean that we can't have favorites in a certain sense or tell me what do you

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:40.600
 think about this if you like you can have love and compassion for all beings but still

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:45.600
 have a special place in your heart for your mother or for your teacher or for your you

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:50.600
 know another friend just because you have love and compassion and bodhicitta for all beings

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:55.600
 doesn't mean on the relative level you have special relationships with people that takes

00:22:55.600 --> 00:23:01.600
 these different forms you know that it's I don't know I think there's like this idea

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:09.600
 that like everything becomes equal and like a bland in a bland uncaring robotic you know

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:15.600
 like generic it's a very generic way it's like the learns the special qualities that

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:20.600
 we're talking about earlier like just as though this blanket love that like everything gets

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:25.600
 kind of like covered in it rather than like kind of highlighting these like specific qualities

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:32.600
 that are kind of dynamically shooting through that blanket of love you know that both can

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:37.600
 like kind of coexist and it's good to I mean they naturally do I think like what you're

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:41.600
 talking about and that's clear in the teaching they say of those three types of meditation

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:47.600
 experience like bliss clarity non-thought that this bliss holding on to a feeling of

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:56.600
 satisfaction of pleasure of happiness of love the whole like that's a really big obstacle

00:23:56.600 --> 00:24:02.600
 whole it's I mean that's what you're talking about this blanket being attached to the

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:07.600
 pleasurable feeling of feeling good you know that that is like one way that the teaching

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:15.600
 really clearly say that this is not that's not boundless love it's an experience that

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:20.600
 we're having and trying to recreate we're trying to hold and it's not like a natural

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:25.600
 expression there's definitely a really strong holding there just as if it was an outer object

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:31.600
 giving us the love and we're holding that too that's what you said so it's that what do you

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:37.600
 how do you make it or how do you allow it to be boundless because you gotta start somewhere

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:43.600
 I think it really has to do with the clinging it's really just like that whole notion of

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:49.600
 like you know so there's this experience of love and putting a box around it or putting

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:54.600
 your hand on it or however you want to say it but it's like drawing a line around it

00:24:54.600 --> 00:25:00.600
 or saying like this this is what it is and I'm calling it this and like it just goes from there

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:14.600
 and name it and like what is love is the classic question love is chocolate ice cream chocolate

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:19.600
 but it seems certain I mean it's kind of what I think we're all talking about Amanda was

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:26.600
 touching on is just it's so simple it's just like music that tames a wild beast or this

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:33.600
 like drop of like nectar that's just so soothing the thought of loving kindness or like Rinpoche

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:39.600
 said you know I forget the exact words Kemper Rinpoche said but when we act like with the

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:48.600
 spirit of loving kindness then we're completely one with the activity of all like beings and

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:54.600
 then the way here with this practice the way you know keeping Bodhicitta the way even like

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:59.600
 this whole book you know on opening to our primordial nature and how Bodhicitta ultimately

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:13.600
 is our primordial nature is nothing but Bodhicitta completely you know unfettered and completely

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:21.600
 awake I mean all those Buddha qualities enlightened qualities and that aspect of so how yeah of

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:26.600
 keeping that thought of enlightenment and keeping the thought of all beings and like

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:32.600
 whatever these drops of nectar that soothe us and like trying to call them back into

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:38.600
 our mind as much and do these beautiful practices because obviously if we're working in the

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:43.600
 thought of enlightenment and Bodhicitta but then also this practice of trying to actualize

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:48.600
 and absorb the teachings into our mind and heart then it's kind of that path there's

00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:54.600
 all these levels and beautiful ways we can connect to like the practices and how Bodhicitta

00:26:54.600 --> 00:27:01.600
 just pulls it all together because ultimately in the teachings it is everything and again

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:07.600
 not to make it murky and like lose sight of all the vivid qualities and dynamics of how

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:15.600
 we can work whether online to actualize our Buddha nature and help you know help be a

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:22.600
 benefit to all beings and be part of just that natural flow that awakens all beings

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:29.600
 to their own Buddha nature and find those drops of peace just the way the practice becomes

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:36.600
 deeper with the way you know we become more and more it's just become more and more rich

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:42.600
 I guess because more and more we're uncovering the beautiful Buddha nature we all have or

00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:55.600
 the Bodhicitta so on page 39 they say that you have to practice these but while you practice

00:27:55.600 --> 00:28:02.600
 them you also try not to box them in but then it's like by practice do they mean do more

00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:10.600
 than just kind of replicate this experience which is pleasurable you know and then not

00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:15.600
 box it in or you know practicing it what do you mean by where it is? That's bottom of

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:21.600
 page 39 which says a lot in compassion do not develop just by talking about them there

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:26.600
 attitudes that have to be practiced so if you practice that attitude isn't that a little

00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:33.600
 bit of kind of it could be it can be boxing it in that's why they say like here Kebabacham

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:37.600
 on his commentary on the words of my perfect teacher the order in which the four boundless

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:42.600
 qualities are explained in the text puts love first like what you were saying however according

00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:46.600
 to the tradition of the fifth instructions if we do not start by meditating on boundless

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:53.600
 impartiality the others will simply turn into the Brahma V Haras basically it will be love

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:59.600
 but it will be limited it will be compassion but it will be limited so I think generally

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:04.600
 they start by thinking of your mother or someone close to you and then cultivating that feeling

00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:08.600
 then thinking of all the other beings that you don't know all your friends and everyone

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:14.600
 else and realizing that infinite times in the past they've been your mother you know they've

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:20.600
 been your friends they've been so many times so expanding that like really specifically

00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:29.600
 one you know to everyone during this session and then they say at the end you have to like

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:34.600
 here maybe just one more thing you said when you've meditated properly on impartiality

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:39.600
 like during the sessions themselves your mind may start to change a little but if you do

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:44.600
 not continue to reflect in the breaks between the sessions when you're going about your

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:50.600
 daily life you will revert to your former habits former bad habits like iron that glows

00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:54.600
 red when heated in the fire and turns dull and black when it is pulled from the flames

00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:59.600
 and left on the ground so it's even more important to meditate in the breaks than during the

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:03.600
 sessions themselves so anyway that's kind of related with the...

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:09.600
 No it seems so I was thinking too like even like what you're talking about in it's almost

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:21.600
 like as soon as we think we know we've stopped to grow it's not that we can't acknowledge

00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:28.600
 like what whatever kind of recognition and realization or understanding or insight we

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:35.600
 might have but as soon as we start to like rest on our laurels or whatever everything

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:39.600
 like it's that in a way whether it's when we stand up and we forget everything in our

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:46.600
 practice in our day you know or whether we just stop to practice practicing altogether

00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:53.600
 because for whatever reason but just like really this whole aspect of practicing there's

00:30:53.600 --> 00:31:00.600
 always more to learn I mean you look at you know our precious great teachers there's studying

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:07.600
 they are contemplating they are meditating you know all the very many edge masters are

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:12.600
 like absorbing there's so much more you know just the more we can just acknowledge all

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:20.600
 of these you know good things dedicate the merit but keep our joy devotion courage and

00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:28.600
 commitment like Rinpoche is always say and our bodhicitta and like just practice keep

00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:36.600
 keep our practice going and alive with this really essential juicy like qualities you

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:44.600
 know without without you know grasping too much or relying too much on what we know not

00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:50.600
 boxing ourselves in in that sense but just keep going like even like you know Ghatte Ghatte

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:57.600
 Para Ghatte Para Song Ghatte Bodhisoka you know just keep going keep going keep going

00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:09.600
 keep going until we really have attained complete enlightenment and inseparably you know radiating

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:15.600
 you know that for all beings and always every step of the way as much as we can thinking

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:21.600
 of others you know and just beginning that seems like it just loosens up our mind and

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:27.600
 our rigid habitual patterns because obviously that's it too we have them we can't expect

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:34.600
 to all of a sudden be fully enlightened it's good good to aspire to that we need to act

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:40.600
 in our yeah first that that thought of enlightenment is the most important I think that's part

00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:46.600
 of what like you're talking about too is just like bodhicitta on the relative level keeps

00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:52.600
 us grounded keeps us like really clear in terms of our daily activities and thinking

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:56.600
 of others really and then it's that thought of enlightenment which we could also say like

00:32:56.600 --> 00:33:01.600
 we're talking about last in the last study group devotion you know those the quality

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:06.600
 of like really seeing all these incredible qualities of the enlightened beings and our

00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:12.600
 teachers and like really aspiring like that that keeps us open and keeps us from like

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:21.600
 getting stuck and and like kind of more mundane you know activities so it's kind of like always

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:26.600
 this too at least two tiered approach of like on the relative level really like thinking

00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:32.600
 of beings like love letting that love pervade our hearts and minds and everything we're

00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:40.600
 doing and like keeping it always open ever open through devotion through contemplating

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:49.600
 the view however you want to say it but like that more like yeah maybe I'll go into this

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:58.600
 third yeah yeah we have a think what yeah so 13 minutes yeah so I'll do the third section

00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:04.600
 real quick so um ribciché say that loving kindness and compassion have many benefits

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:09.600
 ultimately that loving kindness and compassion bring enlightenment and then relatively there

00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:14.600
 are eight benefits that we'll discuss in this third topic and then lastly in this final

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:19.600
 paragraph ribciché say it's important to know the value of having beneficial thoughts

00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:25.600
 and then to actually practice them and we have to practice this always begin our practice

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:30.600
 with this motivation of loving kindness and bodhicitta and then conclude by dedicating

00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:35.600
 the merit for the enlightenment and benefit of all beings and that this activity would

00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:40.600
 then accumulate a measurable merit and then move us towards enlightenment very quickly

00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:45.600
 so I thought lo-drone can you read the third one please?

00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:50.600
 in bodhishaka when you taught the benefits of relative bodhicitta he said that ultimately

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:56.600
 it results in enlightenment and relatively it brings eight special results first of these

00:34:56.600 --> 00:35:01.600
 is that your body and mind remain relaxed and joyful the second result of practicing

00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:07.600
 love and compassion is freedom from illness disease cannot attack you the third is protection

00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:12.600
 from external attacks through weapons the fourth is protection from poison if somebody

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:17.600
 gives you poison or if you accidentally take poison it will not kill you the fifth result

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:21.600
 is that you will be greatly appreciated by everyone not only human beings but non-human

00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:26.600
 beings as well the sixth is that you will be protected by the buddhas and bodhisattvas

00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:31.600
 the realized beings who have already developed bodhicitta the seventh benefit is that you

00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:36.600
 will be reborn in the higher realms the eighth is that all of your wishes will be spontaneously

00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:44.600
 fulfilled you will achieve whatever you desire or whatever you desire without difficulty

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:46.600
 wow

00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:49.600
 sounds like we're getting natural

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:53.600
 good incentive

00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:58.600
 but I had a question about this just a little confusion because it says you can't be harmed

00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:07.600
 by poison you won't get sick you you everyone will appreciate you or it says beings but

00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:11.600
 anyway but it seems like quite a few people who have developed those things to the highest

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:19.600
 level have gotten sick and been poisoned and been attacked by weapons and so what I just

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:24.600
 I don't know what that means or what that is

00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:29.600
 well I don't know the answer but a thought just comes to mind in response to that is

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:35.600
 just that maybe it's you know maybe those things appear to be happening but it's more

00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:40.600
 like their their level of suffering isn't isn't there

00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:46.600
 yeah where where is our mind you know what I mean this whole thing like we're talking

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:52.600
 about earlier being subject to condition so much looking for a thing you know we're relying

00:36:52.600 --> 00:37:00.600
 so much out out out out out but it seems like it really does come to different degrees and

00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:04.600
 then there's a degree of our realization too I mean who knows on the outer level how all

00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:11.600
 these things look and like of course we shouldn't be dismayed if we get sick or if you know

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:18.600
 whatever happens that might you know but it's where we are in our mind like how we're perceiving

00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:23.600
 what's happening to us and relating to it we're like even that beautiful you know image

00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:29.600
 of the you know the dawn like right before Buddhist enlightenment when all the the the

00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:36.600
 legions and infinite like armies of Mara's we're all you know throwing all kinds of weapons

00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:42.600
 at the Buddha but just that loving kindness and that like I mean all these qualities were

00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:50.600
 right there like all the weapons turned to flowers and you know I mean image so I think

00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:58.600
 definitely the fact that we're working with our mind and our own ways of dealing with

00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:03.600
 what's arising and how we see what's arising is definitely part of it and then I think

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:10.600
 like we can see just in the openness of reality the more we have a recognition of that and

00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:16.600
 like the emptiness nature these essence of all phenomena that's arising including subject

00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:21.600
 object all these levels then then naturally which is bori chi that's the whole part of

00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:30.600
 bori chita training too is then that we see all these what seems miraculous you know to

00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:35.600
 beings when we have more of an understanding of that then I mean I can see on that level

00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:42.600
 definitely how these things maybe even to an ordinary being seen from the outside you

00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:51.600
 know maybe it's all these things true you know yeah I mean there's definitely yeah even

00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:55.600
 the Buddha you know there's those stories too you know how like the Mandela thought

00:38:55.600 --> 00:39:01.600
 to through the big boulder and a little chip came and hit the Buddha but that was still

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:06.600
 the ripening of some little bit of karma but it didn't didn't really hurt the Buddha too

00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:12.600
 much you know or just the way that too it's it's lessening I mean the karma is everything

00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:19.600
 bori chita just transforms everything it seems and it seems to like they said like a shanti

00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:23.600
 deva said literally if you overcome your own ego thing and you're filled with bori chita

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:30.600
 you have no enemies literally because enemy depends on two sides you consider me your

00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:35.600
 enemy but I don't consider you my enemy right therefore you're not my enemy you know if

00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:40.600
 I have love and kindness towards you then no matter if you stab me or that's what the

00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:45.600
 teaching said even if they pull you apart from live but you'll have no enemies that

00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:51.600
 anyone could find in the whole universe because your side is you conquered your only enemy

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:59.600
 which is your own selfish ego clinging antagonistic thoughts so from that perspective too it makes

00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:11.600
 more sense to me final statements final yeah I was just wondering is it brought up in the

00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:16.600
 special results that this bori chita does lessening ego clinging like you're talking about the

00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:26.600
 sense of not part me I want does it does that come out need a I mean definitely because

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:31.600
 what they're talking about here this boundless love is the recognition of the emptiness nature

00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:37.600
 of love and therefore having it naturally come out and include all beings appreciating their

00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:42.600
 own Buddha nature to you so I mean they're always just to say that any time I'm talking

00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:47.600
 about love in this chapter is always a emptiness is always there to open this quality of love

00:40:47.600 --> 00:41:10.600
 to you so here I think this is saying that if we have boundless love these are the results

00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:16.600
 that come in some of these are that once we're fully expressive of that nature meaning we're

00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:23.600
 a Buddha and things blocking it then this is what comes for these are the qualities that

00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:29.600
 all these Buddhist experience and as we more and more come close to that and more and more

00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:34.600
 we experience these qualities like on our own side and we're not experiencing the difficulties

00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:41.600
 either just in our own minds I think all of these are talking about less ego clinging

00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:47.600
 I mean I think with each of these results they'd like it's almost like just maybe not said

00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:52.600
 specifically but that's what it means is that like there is less ego clinging involved in

00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:59.600
 every single one I mean that's why I like the Buddha calls them poison like I mean here

00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:05.600
 it's talking about poison twice over poison but just that sense of that's why the Buddha

00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:15.600
 calls the ignorance attachment you know version and then all the rest of the negative emotions

00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:20.600
 poisoned right because it it's just that it no matter what you put it in or mix it with

00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:28.600
 it's poison in that sense and so and that's ultimately that ego clinging is definitely

00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:38.600
 the thing that's really spoiling the whole natural beauty of things and the first step

00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:44.600
 I think of this love is we love ourselves and then if we can love our ego clinging in the

00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:50.600
 sense of not being so tight and hard on ourselves that is how we get the practice off the ground

00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:56.600
 it is how we relate to others and see how they're the same as me and we really definitely

00:42:56.600 --> 00:43:03.600
 start that in practice putting ourselves in the other person's shoes do I like it when

00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:09.600
 someone throws rocks at me and it interests me no so I should not throw rocks into the

00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:14.600
 other person just systematically putting ourselves in other people's shoes I think it's like

00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:20.600
 the foundation of everyone wants to be happy that's what the teachings always say nobody

00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:25.600
 wants suffering so as soon as we can really try to recognize that with every being that

00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:34.600
 we encounter I mean it seems like I mean that's what the teachings say I really the iceberg

00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:48.600
 starts crumbling so simple and so vast and beautiful I'm sure everyone will have their

00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:56.600
 own things to say in the study groups does anyone have anything else or should we dedicate

00:43:56.600 --> 00:44:24.600
 to keep them at home? It's happy holidays! Happy holidays!

00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:54.600
 Happy holidays! Happy holidays! Happy holidays! Happy holidays! Happy holidays! Happy holidays!

00:44:54.600 --> 00:45:10.600
 Happy holidays! Happy holidays! Happy holidays!

00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:17.600
 By this merit may all obtain omniscience may it defeat the enemy wrongdoing from the stormy

00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:23.600
 waves of birth old age sickness and death from the ocean of samsara may I free all beings

00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:28.600
 the precious bodhisattva and those without it may it be generated and those who have

00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:32.600
 it may it never diminish but always continue increasing.
