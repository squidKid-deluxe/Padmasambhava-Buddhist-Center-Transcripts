00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.400
 Vajrasattva practice is very, very important. All the Vajrayana teachings, every Vajrayana teaching

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:18.330
 from the Kriya Tantra and all of the devotees in Tantra, Vajrasattva practice is very important,

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.000
 therefore also is in the Munro practices.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 And generally, there are many reasons to practice Vajrasattvas.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 One of the principal reasons of the practice for the beginning practitioners, such as many of us,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.280
 and as well as also those who are in part already in the part, the practicing Vajrasattva is very

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.000
 important.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 It will withstand our joy, devotion, it cleansing all the negativities and obscurations, obstacles.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 It will cleanse and purify.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.310
 And that is what teaching says. It is so specific. Of course, generally, we do a lot of, what's

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.000
 called, there is a lot of purifying practices.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.620
 That is in the subtle teaching to you. When I am teaching to you, when I am teaching, I do pur

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.000
ifying practices every 15 days.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.360
 They gathered monks and nuns gathered together with purifying practices. Also known as Soviet

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.000
 practices, they do.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.810
 And then in Vajrayana teaching, they do also purifying practices. There is many purifying practices

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.000
, particularly related with the 35 Buddhas.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 35 Buddhas, they do practices, as well as others, other purifying practices.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.170
 And then in Vajrayana teaching, then the most powerful, renowned practices, purifying practices, is

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.000
 through the Vajrasattva practices.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.280
 Generally, so that when we practice the Vajrasattva practices, and always in the teaching said, it

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.000
 will purify all obscurations, negativities and obstacles.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.360
 And those obscurations, and of course, there are many different ways to put this, I mean, this is

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.000
 not just I am talking, but many of these great masters.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.240
 Buddha taught many different ways to understand, highlight this, so that we can not track the

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.000
 mistake.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.810
 We cannot unrelated that mistake over powered us. And therefore, there are many different

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.000
 categories to highlight those.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.270
 And those mistakes, generally there is four obscurations in one way. And two obscurations or four

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:33.000
 obscurations.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.570
 We taught the four obscurations, and many times in the teaching making, particularly when we were

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.000
 practicing purification.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 Those are known as then our listed first four, and then go there with all this four.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 First is known as karma obscurations. Karma obscurations by the Dharma.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:00.810
 And the second obscuration is emotion obscurations. And the third obscuration is knowledge obsc

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.000
urations.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 And the fourth obscuration is habitual obscurations. Those are the four obscurations.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 What is karma obscurations? If I translate the karma obscuration as karma as action, obscuration

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 that comes with action.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 Action. These actions, generally, we can perform two ways we can do the mistakes, obscurations.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:38.890
 One is known as the ikora in the Buddha's teaching, those are natural obscurations. Natural obsc

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.000
urations and constructive obscurations.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 Natural obscurations is in samsara, such as healing is natural obscurations.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:58.020
 Healing or taking lives of others is natural obscurations. Stealing, taking belonging to others is

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.000
 natural obscurations.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.540
 And then deceiving is natural obscurations. There is many like that. Many, those are known as

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.000
 natural obscurations.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.810
 Or in Tibet, Rangi is natural. He just said it's common sense. One way is common sense obscurations

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:16.000
.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:24.990
 That means it is not good, good for anyone, any standard. Any standard, whether you are believing

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.000
 or not believing, any standard.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.730
 Any standard is natural obscurations, or common obscurations, or natural obscurations, common sense

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.000
 obscurations.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:44.180
 And there is another obscuration known as constructive obscurations, or guidance, such as Buddha's

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.000
 teaching.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 Teaching in a monastic or the Vinaya rules, there is over 250 rules. Many of those are constructed.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:04.350
 Trying to restrain our mindfulness, our alertness, so that we are not going to run to the old habit

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.000
 pattern and carry it with that.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 We have to do some mistakes with that. Those are known as constructive negatives. Construct.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:22.090
 Such as, there are many, many, for example, such as, of course, now it's commonly accepted in the

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:23.000
 Tibetan Buddhism.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.010
 It's nothing kind of unusual, but however, for example, in the Buddha's teaching, taking food in

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:30.000
 the upper known,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 or ordering the monks and nuns, taking food in the upper known is not correct, correct.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:45.810
 And this is, again, it's not that the obscuration or negativity, in a way, general common sense

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.000
 level, is not an obscuration.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:56.130
 It's not that negative it is. But however, it is obscuration in the sense of the Buddha's teaching,

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:59.000
 or the rules, in the guidance, it is obscurations.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.730
 And there are many, many others like that. Many, many like that, those are known as constructive

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:07.000
 obscurations.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 And then, for example, even in each country, it has different laws.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 Many of those laws, not necessarily, are common sense negatives, but they created that to protect,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 it has some reasons.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:31.010
 And, for example, in some cases, there is like, 50 pipes. And in some cases, if you go over that in

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:34.000
 that zone, then we are doing mistakes.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 And police will give us the ticket, the speech ticket. And in some areas, there is 65, five.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 And then, again, if you go over that, it's wrong. And in some areas, 75.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:59.000
 That is not the naturally common sense, sense negativity, but it's constructive, that's what it's

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 called.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:08.650
 And in Buddha's teaching, known as natural obscurations, and, sorry, Raghid Khanamatam, and Jaipa

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:09.000
 Khanamat.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:16.270
 Jaipa means constructive, something. So anyway, whatever we do, whatever we do, we stay in that

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:17.000
 frame.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 Whatever we do, it is we are breaking the rules, breaking the rules.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 And we are creating the negatives and obscurations. That is known as obscurations.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:38.120
 Because Buddha's teaching, again, although all guidelines, to re-stain our joy, devotion, body,

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.000
 appreciation, respect, and common sense,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 to stay with the hormone and be peaceful to everyone. That is what really it is.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 And by Jnana teaching, by Jnana teaching, and by Jnana teaching, all of that,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:56.000
 and then bring up the beauty and the belief, call it, of our natures, ourself, that.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:05.000
 So whatever we do, anything mistake we did, that mistake is known as then the karma obscurations.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 I translate the karma obscurations, leejit deva, that is the obscurations.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 And the second obscuration is the root of the common obscurations.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
 That is, I translated, emotion obscurations.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 Emotional obscurations is the fundamental cause and the root performing the action obscurations.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:47.000
 These emotional obscurations, then, many of you all know, those are known as five poisons.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 And then those are the ignorance.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:55.870
 We put everything as poison. We would have used the metaphor to explaining it is a density, call it

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:56.000
,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 a density, like effect, effect. Therefore, we would have used the metaphor, metaphor, poison.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 So, ignorance is poison, poison of the end, poison of the arrogance, and poison of the gerunds.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 Those are five poisons. Above that, also there is another poison, known as doubt.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
 There is another poison of the doubt.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 And the poison of many times, also some very different belief, wrong belief, this is also a poison.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 A poison, what is the effect? It is affecting the peace and the joy and happiness of ours,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 of one's own self and all the beings.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 Therefore, it is a poison, what we have used.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 Ignorant is the fundamental foundation of all the poison arise.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 This is what also in Buddha teaching, the cause of suffering truth.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000
 Suffering truth comes from these emotional obscurations over that.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 So, it is poison. Ignorant is the cause of every emotion from that start-up.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 Ignorant is the drug. Ignorant is very dark. Ignorant is blood.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 Ignorant is behind the scenes of every activity that we do, with six poisons or five poisons.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 It is like darkness. And from that ignorance, then second, most of the death state is attachment.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:51.000
 Attachment arises from that. And from that attachment, then anger kills.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:58.000
 Anger and all that, generally in the teaching said, is in all the rest of the emotions,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 almost a kind of defensive for the attachment, defensive for the protection of the attachment,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000
 protection of the ego-clingers. In a way, ego-clingering is the boss.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:18.000
 They are the instrumental. They are the hiding place of the ego-clingers.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 And ego-clinging is attachment. It is a grasp.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 From there, then the anger bursts out.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 If something is not agreeing with the attachment, with ego, then it is known as the anger.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 And something is not attached with you, or argued with you, with you.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
 Again, ego and jealousy arises.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:50.000
 Jealousy is the combination of the teaching, the combination of the attachment and anger.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000
 United target. Feeling that you are going to lose something,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:01.000
 or there is something that is coming up, going to prevent our ego activities.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 And that is the jealousy that is coming up.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 And then, and we have some fulfillment, or some success, or some preview of that,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 then the ego comes.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 Erogan comes is something kind of almost like short superiority of yourself,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 among the groups, among the others, you feel some kind of sense of the spirit,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
 something that is strong, or something important.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 That is the ego comes.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 Erogan is generally in the teaching making.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 There are seven kinds of arrogance, sorry, arrogance.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
 That can be, arrogance can be.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
 And those are, I think, by two times, "K.G. But they shall only make it."

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 And I will list again, so you will know that.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
 And first is known as small arrogance.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 What is small arrogance?

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 Of course, first is just arrogance.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 First is arrogance.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
 And second is small arrogance.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
 And third is big arrogance.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 And fourth is arrogance, more arrogance from the arrogance.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
 More arrogance from the arrogance.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:29.630
 And then fifth is some kind of arrogance that fills your self-stone, or "I am, I am that, I am that

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:30.000
."

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
 That arrogance.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 And then sixth is known as arrogance of the blind arrogance, arrogance.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 Blind, blind arrogance, or, yeah, I translate that, blind, blind arrogance.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:57.000
 The seventh is wrong arrogance, or very wrong arrogance.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 So those are the seven arrogance.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 But I will go a little bit into that.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:09.270
 Fourth of arrogance is generally, this always, when arrogance comes, you always have some compar

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:10.000
ators.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:18.340
 And therefore, fourth arrogance is something that lower than your self, kind of project to that

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:19.000
 individuals,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 and feel, "I am that better than them."

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:30.000
 Then, "Oh, I am someone that lower than you, or something equal to you."

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 And we start thinking, "I am that better, or I am equal with these guys."

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 We have that attitude, or that kind of known as them, that arrogance, just simple arrogance.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:52.000
 And then second arrogance is small arrogance.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:15:01.000
 Small arrogance is something that you are projecting to your equal person.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:08.000
 Similar standard, but you start thinking, that even though this person is good,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 "I am better, I am better, I am quite good, I am quite good."

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:19.000
 Having that attitude in the mind, and that is, I mean, that comes with arrogance.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 That is the second arrogance, small, small arrogance.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:35.000
 And third arrogance is now with the equal, equal individuals, to see that, and we start thinking,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 "I am much better than this, this, I am great, I am great."

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000
 Having that attitude is known as big arrogance.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:55.000
 And then, again, we compare it with similar such equal person, but at the same time,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 projecting higher than more educated than you.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:05.000
 More educated, more kind of, in a way, more better person than you start, or we start thinking,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:12.000
 "Oh, this is good, that person is quite good, but I am much better than him."

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 Having that attitude, that kind of attitude is known as the arrogance of arrogance.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:28.000
 And then, the fifth arrogance is, then, this is generally every sentence,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
 "We all have this arrogance."

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 In the teaching, you say, "This is the equal community, it's just, I am this."

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.000
 And then, for that reason, and again, even in lessons, in English, you put,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.000
 always, couples, whenever we mention, "I, I is company."

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:54.000
 That tells, that tells, among the older, the consonants in the words,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 "I standing with God."

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
 (Laughter)

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
 "I am God, crookedly."

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:11.000
 That's how it is. That is, just intently, in the teaching, said, "I am that."

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000
 That's it. That tells. That is not it.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:21.000
 And the sixth arrogance is, is believing arrogance.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
 Believing arrogance is, some individually,

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 properly have the kind of, like, idea that they are someone, someone.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:38.000
 There's no reason that, but, however, that those individually believe,

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:44.000
 truly convinced themselves that they are someone,

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.000
 or someone they appreciate, they feel they are that, "I am that."

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.000
 Or, "I have that realization. I am the first woman person.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 I am the great yogur. I am the great things."

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 That could be, you know, spiritually kind of connected.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 That could be worldly connected.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 They're completely kind of convinced.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
 They believe. They're not just lie-making of that,

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.000
 but they, themselves, believe that, and act, trying to act with that.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000
 This is done as, then, in the Buddha teaching.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000
 It is something blind, arrogance.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000
 And that happens many times, also. I don't know, you heard that, too.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 But many times, we got emails, or I got, or Kim, I mean, we have together,

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000
 we got emails, letters, clapping. Many people, say,

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:42.000
 "They're my tiddies. I'm material, material.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000
 The future Buddha, upcoming Buddha is my tiddies."

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.000
 They start, "I'm the material, this and that, and I leave these places."

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 And the reason, also, we caught up one email.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000
 I think, Lauren, I caught one email saying, "I'm Pema Samba."

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000
 Pema Samba is well, and good health, and he's a small man.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
 Small man! Really, he said, "Please tell that to everyone."

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 I believe Pema Samba is well and good health.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000
 She got emails. I think, maybe, I'm not sure if you all got it.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
 She walks in a bicycle shop.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 He walks in a bicycle shop, and tells everyone, "Pema Samba is well, well, well, it's true.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
 This is the one."

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.000
 And then, before I remember, I told, we told, Master told,

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 "This is the time when he's on the unit."

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
 And this one man, man really came.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:44.000
 I mean, I was, at that time, ending Haiti I or Haiti, whatever, around that time,

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000
 and his own dungeon, which was in New York City.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 And I went out, and even he come back.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 I come back. There's one temple at that time, and he went back to Tibet.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:58.000
 He tried to follow up on his own dungeon, which he was, or he is.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 And so, when I come back, they started, he started jogging.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000
 There's also another, he's on the disciple.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000
 He travels quite a lot in the Western too.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000
 His name is Lama Ricci.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000
 And his name is Cappo's name, Cappo Tutti.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000
 He said, "Cappo Tutti started jogging too."

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 Lama Ricci is so powerful, even he subdued Dorguetolo.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000
 Dorguetolo.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
 Dorguetolo, whenever you know, right?

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 Dorguetolo is at the emanation of Murpema Samba.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:36.000
 So Lama Ricci is so powerful that even he subdued Dorguetolo, he said.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000
 I don't know what he is talking about.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 And so, what happened is, because that time,

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 when he was on the dungeon, he said, "Pipe store, pipe floor, pipe floor."

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 We are in the pit floor.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
 We are also in the pit floor.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.000
 So any visitor comes, they must come always up there,

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000
 so let us know, and then we will go early,

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000
 and then if they have appointment, go to see his owners.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000
 That's what we do.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000
 So, Cappo Tutti said, so Lama Ricci said,

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000
 "Apranam, somebody is knocking the door."

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000
 Knocking the door, the door.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000
 He said, "Who is this?"

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000
 They said, "Dorguetolo."

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000
 "Who is this?"

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000
 "Dorguetolo."

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000
 He said, "Dorguetolo."

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000
 So he said, "Dorguetolo."

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000
 So then when they opened, one hippie man,

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000
 a hippie man, he said, "I am Dorguetolo."

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:46.000
 And he said, his owner, Dorguetolo is a regent of Burpema Sambo.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000
 Therefore, I like to be recognized,

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:54.000
 and glorified, honored that.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000
 He really like to have that, "I am Dorguetolo."

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000
 So, could we make an appointment?

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000
 So, he got upset, and he maybe yelled something.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000
 So then I think he went, "Wait, wait."

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 So next time, I think he went up all the time.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000
 Then he came, and I was trans-lateral.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:16.000
 I was trans-lateral, and so he came and he said that,

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000
 again, he said that he is Dorguetolo.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 He said, "What?"

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.000
 True his Holiness.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.000
 True his Holiness, he said.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000
 In the former life, he was a regent.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.000
 He really true, he said.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 Former life, he was a regent.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000
 But this time, I am Dorguetolo.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:37.000
 And I like to be, "You please help our honor,

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 or acknowledge me with that."

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000
 And then his Holiness answer was...

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.000
 He asked for a letter.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.000
 Yeah, letter, something.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 And so his Holiness answer that,

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000
 "If you are Dorguetolo, I don't have to do anything."

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 So actually, I don't need Dorguetolo.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000
 If you're not, you don't need one.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 Yeah, if you're not, you don't need something.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000
 And that's what really he said.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.000
 Really he said that.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000
 And then he said, "I'm yogi, I'm hungry,

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000
 and we have some food to give me," he said.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.000
 And then he told me that,

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000
 of course, life is finished already,

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000
 but then he said to look something food.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000
 So I went to the kitchen and I bought some fruit

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.000
 and all that I gave.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 So this is really true.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 I mean, I think maybe they believe that.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.000
 They believe this.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000
 I saw him when he's on the hill, he passed away.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000
 I went to France in the dodo.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000
 When he passed away, I saw him in the dodo.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000
 He is there too.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000
 So that way.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:41.000
 But anyway, this is the story of the blind, the arrogance.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000
 Arrogance.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000
 And during the Buddha time,

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000
 there is also one known as kashapa with long hair.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000
 It's not maha kashapa, there's another kashapa known as long hair.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000
 Also really, it's a renowned one.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000
 He has many students too.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000
 But he always believed, it's not that he's pretending that,

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000
 but he believed he is something high in relaxation beings.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:13.000
 And he said that, he acted, and he told that to the student,

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 it's not lying, it's not the same, but he believed that.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:22.000
 So this is known as mopanga, or the blind arrogance.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.000
 And then the fifth, the seventh arrogance is long arrogance.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000
 This is certain people have the arrogance that,

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000
 kind of like to do the negative activities.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000
 For instance, I said, I can do that.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000
 I'm an expert to kill, to do something.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:43.000
 Kind of like, it's really a very disturbance.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 Destruction is not beneficial,

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000
 but certain people have the strong arrogance,

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000
 strong belief, belief that they can do that.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000
 That maybe they do too.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000
 But really arrogance, they do.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000
 Those are seven types of arrogance.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000
 Whatever arrogance you have,

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 the call of arrogance is, of course, then what we lost?

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000
 We lost the humble and the respect.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:19.000
 Respect, and respect and appreciation is undermined.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:24.000
 At the same time, because of that, we won't grow ourselves.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000
 We won't grow, we won't develop.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:31.000
 In the teaching of Dr. Yu, he said that arrogance is an iron ball.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.000
 Iron completely solid ball that won't hold any water.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000
 Water, it just goes out.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000
 You won't, you won't, we won't grow.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 We won't learn, we won't develop.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:52.000
 At the same time, then respect and appreciation is become very money.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000
 And that is what arrogance is.
