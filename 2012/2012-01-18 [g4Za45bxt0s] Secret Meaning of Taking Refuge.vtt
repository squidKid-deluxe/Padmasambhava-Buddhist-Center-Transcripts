00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.880
 Several refugees in the teaching, again in meditation and teaching, said something that again so

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:14.550
 connected to us, us, and so important to us, those unknown as then, with our physical conditions,

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:21.000
 such as channel, wind, and essence element of the body.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:32.860
 These three components in the body are the vital of our body, our really existence, channel, and

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:39.000
 wind, and essence element, essence element.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:49.930
 This is not just only this physical, but even the external level. These three are very vital of

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:58.000
 this. Therefore, it is something so important for our enlightened qualities.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 And those are again, channel. Channel and channel, wind, and essence element.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:24.910
 Now, essence element as we are trying to connect to our external object of refuge, these three

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:35.630
 secret things. So, the essence element as Buddha, and wind as Dharma, and channels are as Sangha

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.000
 members.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:45.580
 And through that, we discover that our enlightened qualities understand of this. Again, essence,

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.000
 generally, these three are all connected.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:02:04.680
 According to the Vedayana teaching, these three are the very vital and the very essence element of

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.000
 ourself, all the universe.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 And for that reason, for example, and the body, the channel aspect, channel aspect is like body.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:31.130
 Without the channel, nerve systems, there is no body. This channel is the best of these poem

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.000
 formations that what we see is poems.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:47.260
 Poems are the reflections of our channel, our nerve systems, which is known as in Vedayana teaching

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.000
 that you heard many times, the Vedaya body.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:04.880
 Vedaya body, that is in visible state, visible state. It is according to syllable level, it is om,

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.000
 om.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:16.740
 About the color level, it is white. White is more visible, more reflective, because it's something

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.000
 connected with the tones.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 That's what channel is. Channel is the beginning of these formations.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:38.740
 When we understand the secrets of these channels, understanding, that means we are exploring the

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.000
 enlightened energy as Sangha members,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 all the display of this variety of the display of the energies that are arising as ray of light.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 Signing, we begin to activate and observe and bring to the enlightened state of Sangha.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:14.230
 And then the second is the wind. Wind is so again another important component of our existence and

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.000
 as well as external things.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 Without the wind, nothing will move. Everything will become dead. This is the word, wind.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 In the Vedayana teaching, what is known as this wind energy? Wind is known as the Vedaya speech.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:56.260
 Vedaya speech is the movement, the voice that echoes, that brings the clarity, that brings the

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.000
 understanding to each other.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:11.050
 The communication bridge is the wind. And that syllable, what is it called in Vedayana teaching?

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:12.000
 You all know.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:28.120
 The "A". "A" is the basic song, the ordinal song. That is it. And the color is the red. That is

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.000
 what "A".

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:38.560
 And this is again, with this understanding of the wind energy, wind qualities, what are we going to

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.000
 master?

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 We are mastering all the understand of the voice and the speech.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:52.730
 This voice and the speech understand is voice of the wisdom, voice of loving kindness, voice of

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:56.000
 compassion, unseasoned voice.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.770
 That's what in the teaching, often you heard in the Vedayana teaching, and as well as in the Mahay

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:10.000
ana teaching, the Sambo Gaya is always unseasoned teaching, unseasoned teaching.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:19.960
 There is no stopping. Teaching is continuing. That's also what you call here. The music is in "A",

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.000
 right? You have to pull out.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:33.740
 That's it. This all, this voice of the wisdom is what is unseasoned state. That is known as the

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.000
 wind energy.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 And then of course our breathing, all these things too, is part of the wind.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:53.440
 And this is what the Dharma is. Dharma is the message of love, kindness, compassion, restoring the

00:06:53.440 --> 00:07:01.000
 confidence, courage, commitment, and respecting appreciation to all others.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:10.570
 That it brings up that by this voice, this energy. And we use the right way. That is Dharma. That

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:15.000
 is the secret object of the Dharma.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:29.530
 Then the next one is what? Known as the essence. Essence element of the body. Essence, generally

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:30.000
 essence.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:44.210
 This essence is again what is Buddha, generally. Buddha is Sanskrit word in which every translation

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:50.000
 of that into English, I think it is known as "awaked one".

00:07:50.000 --> 00:08:04.550
 Awaked. Awaked one. This essence has again many different meanings. Of course we won't go all these

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:06.000
 different things.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:14.150
 But essence has many different meanings. And what is intubate? Known as "piggly". Piggly is

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:21.000
 translated as essence ploid, plude, right? Plude.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:32.560
 But also "piggly" means spear. Spear or zero. "Piggly" means zero. "Piggly" means spear. "Piggly"

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:37.000
 means essence plude. Ploid. Ploid.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:46.400
 Ploid. That's what essence "piggly" means. All that. But in this case, for example, again "piggly"

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:57.000
 is something that has connected with, call it of, the blessfulness and wisdom.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:10.740
 Blessfulness and wisdom is the essence, nature of ours. Your nature, my nature. Blessfulness of the

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:12.000
 emptiness.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:20.580
 When blessfulness is, therefore everyone is in the world, if they have feelings, consciousness,

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:24.000
 always looking for the blessfulness.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:34.740
 Because it's a deep, drawn, yearning cause. It's a deep calling because that is nature. It's not

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:39.000
 something that is unnatural. Blessfulness is natural.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:47.560
 But when we must handle that blessfulness, looking for that, and then it becomes the emotions. Then

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:50.000
 it becomes the hindrance.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:59.520
 Therefore, the nature of this spear, nature of this plude, whatever the level we're talking, the

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:04.000
 nature is blessfulness of the emptiness.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:14.740
 Emptiness means what? Emptiness means "Muslim." It's a waking status. It's a wake. So, blessfulness

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:22.000
 is wake. That is the nature of ours, nature of you, the nature of me.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 That is Buddha. A waking blessfulness. A wake, a wake blessfulness. This is our central essence.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:44.080
 That is, this is, according to the Vediana teaching, to activate this nature has many different

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.000
 names.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:54.050
 "Gurupayama Sambhava," "Buddha Shakyamuni," "Tara," "Avalokirishora," "All the Vedic Kalaaya," "H

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:57.000
aya Giva," and "Kala Chakra," and so forth.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:05.000
 But that is basic calling, the ultimate nature, ultimate nature of what we are.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:13.150
 So, when we need that understanding, that Buddha, then all the displays is transcendent into

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:16.000
 everything into that status.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:25.960
 When it came or appeared in the syllable, what is called? That you own. The home. That's it, true.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:28.000
 Home. Home.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:36.070
 That's it. The color of a home is what? Always sense it. What? Blue. That's it. Yes. And blue is

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:38.000
 what symbolize.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:50.980
 I'm changing. And blue is also deep of the sky. Sky, colors. Colors. It's not going to change

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:52.000
 anyways.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:58.740
 Never going to what, no matter whatever the century changed, the millennium changed, whether it

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:02.000
 started changing by the big bangs and not big bangs.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:15.000
 And no matter whatever, I think blue sky will remain. I guarantee money back.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:28.880
 We will see this after 1,000, or 2,000, 3,000, or 3,000 million years after. If someday change,

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:32.000
 call me.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 I will give back the penny. But that time, maybe penny will cost more, so you can't drink.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 I heard news that there's a penny, there's one penny that you can get over 400,000. You heard that?

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
 Yeah, really. Really, one penny.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 I don't know. You Google search for that penny. Really, I heard that.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:15.000
 So therefore, this is called a secret object reference.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.970
 And this is why I call it a secret, because this is something that is inherited with us, with

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:21.000
 ourselves now.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 We're not talking, I'm not talking, or Buddha is not talking.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:31.590
 The greatest teacher in Gurbia is not talking, something that is not with us. This is tangible

00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:34.000
 things. This is true.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:40.630
 True. We have channel, we have wind, we have essence element. That's why we're breathing. That's

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:42.000
 what we like.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:53.720
 So when we see the close, I mean, see this nature as it is, in the reality as it is, then we can

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:55.000
 get enlightenment.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 That's why the Vadiyana teaching is so powerful, so special.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:05.350
 You're using all the different ways of exploring this enlightened nature, not just one way, but

00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:07.000
 many different techniques,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 and applying and then discovering our treasures. That's natural.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 And so that is really about the secret object of reference.
