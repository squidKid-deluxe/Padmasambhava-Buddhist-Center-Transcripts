00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.120
 Thank you, everyone. Welcome everyone. Again, we are going to follow the teachings, what we are

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:09.980
 going through,

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:19.390
 and the teachings that are taught by a great teacher, Japji Dhenu Rinpoche, according to his

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:20.640
 instructions,

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:28.200
 we are following in this teaching, the condensed, the essential, hard-advised teaching.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:36.680
 So again, we are going to follow the teachings, as always, in teaching said, and all great masters

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:44.400
 also often mention, we should strengthen our beautiful intention, motivation, intention,

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:53.560
 restatement, beautiful motivation, motivation or intention of joy and application, and vastness,

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.960
 motivation of the bodhicitta,

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:04.600
 and purity, motivation of the Vedayana teachings. Those are combined together, and then reflect

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:11.640
 and observe the teachings into the heart. And in this teaching, again, we are going through the

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:18.910
 contrast of the three frames of the entire when we do the practices or meditating, and those are

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.800
 the three novels.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:28.840
 And I mentioned that I listed those three novels, and of course, you all know too, so now we are

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.680
 going through the three novels.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:41.420
 And the first novel is the intention, and that is known as skillful means of the intention of the

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.840
 bodhicitta and the devotions,

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:53.240
 and then as well as joy and appreciation. Those are the skillful means. What that actually means is

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.720
 when we

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:02.440
 raise up those beautiful motivations, it will transform everything into beautiful practices,

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.240
 practices.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:10.520
 All our sessions for one hour, if we do practices, if we start with those beautiful intentions,

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:20.040
 really, it will direct that kind of on that line. So therefore, it is transforming our one session

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.400
 practices

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.720
 by these beautiful motivations. Therefore, it is so important. And among the motivations, we are

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.920
 talking about the bodhicitta.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:37.400
 In the bodhicitta, I made divisions, or I mean, it's not an aspect. In that, I kind of called the

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.040
 teachings,

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:44.860
 I mentioned those, and of course, I also mentioned about the nature or the identity of the bodhic

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:45.560
ittas.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:54.910
 Then we went the division of the bodhicittas, and all those divisions can summarize into two bodhic

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:55.480
ittas.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:03.250
 Those are known as the wishing bodhicitta and actualizing bodhicitta, and that's the true bodhic

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.960
itta.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:12.520
 So now we're going on these wishing bodhicittas. Now this bodhicitta is the mind of enlightenment

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:22.280
 as English translated in Sanskrit is bodhicitta, and in it, it is chancha-sen.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:29.880
 So now we're going on the wishing bodhicitta. Wishing bodhicitta is again so important.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:37.400
 It is the foundation of the bodhicitta, bodhicitta. What the great master Shanti Deva said in the

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:44.520
 teaching that we often pray that in our, every time when we do pray, I will read this in this,

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:52.520
 and then you all know this. Many of you may know this. This is what in the teaching said here.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:04:02.360
 The precious bodhicitta, in those without it, may it be generated. In those who have it,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:12.200
 may it never be managed, but always continue to increase. That is what really the bodhicitta.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:19.320
 The first is precious bodhicitta. That is precious bodhicitta. The precious bodhicitta

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:27.320
 is not just only certain people have that, and we don't have that. We all have this bodhicitta,

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:35.400
 this potential of the bodhicitta. The person trying our bodhicitta, most of the bodhicitta

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:44.280
 is hiding, only sleeping, sleeping state. Now we have to wake up that. We have to wake up this.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:52.840
 So therefore what the great master Shanti Deva said, precious bodhicitta, those individuals,

00:04:53.480 --> 00:05:05.160
 individual, in those without it may generate it, may generate it. So how we may be generating that?

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:17.080
 That is wishing bodhicitta. We are going to generate this by knowing the importance and values

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:29.160
 of bodhicitta, therefore we are generating the wishing bodhicitta. When we generate the wishing

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:36.360
 bodhicitta, how are we going to maintain that bodhicitta? That is also wishing bodhicitta,

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:43.960
 but at the same time actualizing bodhicitta. That will keep, is not going to demolish it,

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:51.800
 but going to increase the bodhicitta, going to do the bodhicitta. So therefore this bodhicitta

00:05:51.800 --> 00:06:00.760
 is the hidden nature. In a way it is a hidden worrying that within sleeping in the midst of the

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:10.600
 old duality self-important conceptions. Now we have this, the worrying, we have to really wake up.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:19.320
 This worrying, when we wake up this worrying, this is not just only worrying to benefit our self,

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:26.120
 but it is benefiting all living beings. But it's also not just a benefit to our self,

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:34.040
 short period of time, for a few short time or a few hours, a few days, you know, a few months.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:40.360
 When we wake up the worrying self of the bodhicitta, it is going to benefit for us

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:49.800
 all the time. From that point we are really the winners. We are the winner, we are in the

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:57.480
 direction of the victorious, we are in the direction and going to defeat to all the obstacles

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:05.640
 that will be disturbing us so many lifetimes. And we have the memories of our lifetimes,

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:14.760
 how many lifetimes this ego clinging, this self-important, self-centered mind

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:22.680
 disturbs us one after another. They're so paternity, it looks like they're going to help us,

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:33.400
 and kind of paternity and naive and hidden, but yet they are the most dangerous obstacles

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:41.640
 to us for all the time according to the great teacher, Buddha Shatya Muni and Gaurav Vammasama.

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:48.600
 Now, how we can defeat this? How we can really defeat that obstacle for us,

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:56.120
 but also it's obstacles for others? How are we going to defeat? That is then, as I said,

00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:05.000
 we shall really let wake up our warriorships or our brave warriors of this bodhicitta.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:14.200
 If we wake up this bodhicitta, what is that? The principle, simple benefit, simple kind of

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:19.240
 call it of this. What is the teaching said? The great master, I mean is the Buddha Shatya Muni's

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:25.480
 teaching, but what the great master, the future Buddha, who's going to become the next Buddha,

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:34.040
 the next time after the Buddha Shatya Muni said, "My dear, in his mighty praise," many of you do

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:41.720
 that prayer too. In that prayer he said, "And really the benefit, the power of the bodhicitta

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:48.840
 is going to be defeated." In the end, it will go and blow the passage of the lower arms,

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:58.520
 back into this, and blow the passage of the lower arms and open the door of the upper arms.

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:09.240
 It will lead us beyond death and getting all those sufferings. That is bodhicitta. He said,

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:17.160
 "Therefore, I pay homage. I respect the bodhicitta." That is really the bodhicitta.

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:24.040
 So therefore, this reaching bodhicitta is the fundamental, the foundation of the bodhicitta,

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:34.200
 of the entire bodhicitta. And therefore, this again, so reaching bodhicitta is so important

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:41.560
 and we can maintain and activate that in four different points. And that is

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:48.360
 poor, boundless. As I said, you all know. Again, I'm not talking something new things.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:58.120
 We all remember, we all know and heard this poor, boundless. We even jite.

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:07.640
 But many times we really jite. Or mostly we jite here. We jite here. Or maybe what here in the

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:14.120
 West, they said, "Lip services." We just say that walls not really coming from the heart.

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:23.400
 We're going to make that truly is coming from our heart, from our heart. We're going to stand and

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:32.360
 try to stand at least that short time, or maybe five minutes, standing firmly on the wall, what

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:39.080
 we say, or firmly behind that meaning of that, we're trying to stay behind the meaning of the wall,

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:48.360
 what we're jiting. Jiting. Then it's become the boundless. Had no boundaries. Boundless means no

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:56.200
 boundaries. Person day or person's time, also we have love, we have compassion, we have joy.

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:06.840
 But it's all limited. It's with border. It's not really limitless. Everything's border. It's

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:15.720
 blocked. Our love is limited. Our compassion is limited. Our joy is reduced, is limited.

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:23.960
 And our income limit is very, very limited. That's really what we are now. But this time,

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:31.240
 we are open the door of these qualities. Realitately, the love has no border.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:34.600
 Compassion has no border.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:45.800
 Rejoice has no border. And economic has no border. Why? Because mind has no border.

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:56.200
 This mind, nature of the mind, you read. Our sorrow, each of us read it. Does our mind has border?

00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:08.670
 No. There's no way we can help. There is border of the mind. That is what. But who's who put

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:09.160
 borders?

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:19.960
 Is our deluded mind or the ego clinging so important, trying to strengthen and strengthen

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:29.080
 of that? It's knocking our own peace to our own head. Head making that.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:38.280
 We're not letting the way the nature is. Natural mind. Therefore, the gracious,

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:46.440
 kindness, compassion, wise teacher, without opening the door for all living beings.

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:57.880
 Love for all living beings. Compassion for all living beings. Rejoice, joy for all living beings.

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:09.080
 And the equanimity, no borders. So that is what really boundness. Again, why is boundness in the

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:17.560
 teaching? Because love or discordness has no borders. But where we project that love,

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:26.760
 this poor boundness, love and compassion, what's this? We are not limited for the projection or

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:36.520
 the object. Our object is we're talking all descendant beings. Is there a number of descendant

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:46.200
 beings? According to Buddhism, there is no numbers. For example, is there borders of the sky

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:54.760
 or space? According to Buddha's teaching, there is no borders. No boundaries of the sky.

00:13:55.880 --> 00:14:05.800
 Similarly, the sentient beings are vastness as space. Sentient beings, all the beings. If you don't

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:17.800
 know the sentient beings, beings. B-E-R-N-G. Being has no limitation. No numbers. It's numberless

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:27.320
 beings. And each of those living beings has, oh, everyone has emotions. Everyone has karma.

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:36.440
 Emotion is karma. That is the cause of suffering the difficulties. Everyone is struggling.

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:44.760
 The numberless beings are struggling with their own treasure of the karma and emotions. Or emotion

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:54.520
 is karma. Therefore, our love and compassion match to all that beings. For that reason,

00:14:54.520 --> 00:15:02.600
 it's also known as boundless love. Because it's objected or projected to all those beings,

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:09.320
 numberless beings. Then in the teaching said, the gracious teacher, Buddha Haqqamani said in the

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:16.520
 teaching, said power and the benefit of the love and compassion that is boundless.

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:24.680
 Because the love is boundless, projected is boundless and the benefit is boundless.

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:33.720
 Benefit to who? To whom? Benefit to all those beings and the benefit of one's own self.

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:43.080
 It's boundless. It's limitless. Therefore, it is known as boundless.

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:49.160
 Boundless love, boundless sentient beings, boundless result and benefit.

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:57.640
 Benefit or not? This benefit is not just a short time period of the benefit. But this is,

00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:04.360
 in the teaching said, what? It goes on. If the thing is like kind of space,

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:09.880
 the body, the benefit of the body, we put on the tangible kind of combs and we put,

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:19.320
 the sky is not enough to fit all the benefits. Even the sky cannot hold the power and benefit

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:31.320
 or result of the body or the surplus of the body cannot bend. Hold by the hold or fit all that in

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:40.040
 the sky. That's really how power is. This power, the body that is the one that's going to defeat

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:49.560
 all our karmas, negativities, obscurations, obstacles, the hindrance that which we've

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:57.800
 accumulated piled up from the biggest time until now. That is going to buy a clear way,

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:08.120
 knocked away without any trace by this precious body together. Therefore, this body together is

00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:14.840
 so, so, so special. For that reason, I said the other day, and you heard this also many times,

00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:20.360
 great master papa, remember, he said, this is just again some one thing. If you have one thing,

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:28.360
 that's enough which is both each other. That means if you have one thing, if you have one practice,

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:33.960
 that would be enough to get enlightenment or become Buddha. That is both each other.

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:40.040
 And we don't have this one thing of the body together, no matter whatever the practice,

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:47.400
 princey name, the titles, practice, this and that things, is all not going to go to the direction

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:55.720
 of the enlightenment because it's connected self-important, self-important. And it is grasping

00:17:55.720 --> 00:18:00.680
 and clingings. We've been doing self-important activity according to Buddha's teaching,

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:08.120
 from the biggest time. There is even no numbers of our lives how many times we talk about.

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:14.680
 It is really numberless. And that's how we're doing it. But what we're doing,

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:21.720
 still we're struggling, still we're challenging, still we are completely crushed by all these

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:26.440
 difficulties. Coughs and fears, kind of coincidentally one after another with me.

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:33.320
 Never really had any kind of like, for example, like permanent dissolution of the peace and

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:38.520
 happiness. Oh, ah, now I'm just relaxed. I can't say peace and happiness is peaceful.

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:43.640
 Even we get troubles to be difficult. We are going to put, for example, in a cruise ship.

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:48.520
 We're considering the best place to have vacation and relax and enjoy.

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:53.720
 Ended up the towns. All vacation lands, all the different places.

00:18:53.720 --> 00:19:02.280
 Even that is considered in a samsara, also very luxurious, high standards. And the PC house,

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:08.520
 bed house, sitting in the drop top, top best with the jakus and heart tower and swimming pool

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:15.320
 and everything. But yet, what are they going through? The emotionally, mentally, psychological,

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:22.840
 so many people, those who sit there almost looks like cage. Caged on the glass is all those places.

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:31.320
 But in reality, they're going all the better. What's wrong? What's happening? Because of this,

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:38.440
 according to Buddha's teaching, we couldn't keep up this control, this ego clinging,

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:45.080
 mind and habit pattern. It's so important. It's so important, mind, ego, clinging. So,

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:52.680
 it's like greed. It's never enough. Never enough. Even you have the best still is not enough.

00:19:52.680 --> 00:20:00.040
 That goes on and on. One after another. That's what it is. So for those reasons,

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:06.760
 we were, we raised up the bodhicata, the precious bodhicata. The four bonds start with the four

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:12.760
 bonders. And now, again, I'm going to talk with the four bonders. As I said yesterday,

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:20.280
 and the continuity, and yesterday I spoke with boneless love, love and boneless compassion.

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:27.400
 Now, boneless love, when we put that in a place and practicing that, and practice,

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:44.040
 and that is it. May all living beings, all living beings have happiness and cause of happiness.

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:51.800
 May all mother living beings have happiness and cause of happiness.

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:58.920
 Now, happiness we know. That is we know of happiness. But what is cause of happiness?

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:09.240
 Cause of happiness is love and kindness itself is cause of happiness. And compassion is

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:21.320
 cause of happiness. Wisdom is cause of happiness. And therefore, we are going to pray,

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:28.440
 they have always happiness, but same time, reaching to their happiness remains forever

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:36.280
 because of the cause. If they have the continuity, every living have the continuously love and

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:37.080
 kindness

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:43.160
 compared to the wisdom of their heart and mind, their love or their happiness, their peace,

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:54.040
 their relaxation will last so long forever. Therefore, when the body is sad to us,

00:21:54.040 --> 00:22:03.320
 when we develop the body, we pray not just for the happiness now, but also for the future

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:11.240
 continuously. And what the teaching says, we pray for the cause and the result and the conditions.

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:21.800
 What? We pray for that cause, we pray for the result. The cause of love and compassion

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:30.120
 will produce the result of happiness. That is what it is. So therefore, we pray.

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:41.160
 And the next one is the compassion. May all mother living beings free from suffering and cause of

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:49.400
 suffering. Now we know the suffering, that is a result. So many people are going through that.

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:56.600
 Through that, we are all going through. Some do be up and down. We are all going through.

00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:04.520
 That is the result. That is the present of our situations. But what the cause of that

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:15.000
 is according to the Buddha's teaching. That cause is the negative emotions and it is an action

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:25.320
 known as karma. Gamma and negative emotions are the cause. That is really the cause of all

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:31.640
 sufferings. So this prayer generally, may all living beings be free from suffering,

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:37.960
 cause of suffering, is also prayer only to say that what the greatest teacher, Buddha Shakyamala,

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:47.560
 said. Suffering truth, cause of suffering truth, among all noble truth. This is the positive truth,

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:55.800
 to suffering truth. And suffering truth is not going to arise without any cause and condition.

00:23:55.800 --> 00:24:03.640
 Condition is not just a boom like that. It has cause, it has condition. It is simply behind

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:11.560
 the scenes for a long time, then brought the sufferings. That is the one. And that cause and

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:19.320
 condition is negative emotions. Negative emotions. And what are those negative emotions? Of course,

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:29.160
 we all know the names. The word is anger, attachment, and the jealous, hated thought.

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:35.160
 Those are the front runner. Behind is ignorance and ego cleanings.

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:42.520
 Those are the behind the scene of the negative emotions. They are the fundamental. They are the

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:52.040
 force. But that producing. We need to activate that. Then it comes. When anger and ignorance

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:58.680
 are activated, we need to come to the action. Then it comes with attachment, and aggression,

00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:05.320
 anger, jealousness, hated thought. Then all those are kind of bursted.

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:12.760
 Then what is does? Then according to the Buddha's teaching was named, and then it happened. Action.

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:22.760
 Consequence. That is karma. Karma is a Sanskrit word, which means action. Activate, perform.

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:30.840
 But that action and what that did is not going there. The residue, the result,

00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:40.760
 imprint of the, that action remains long time. It remains to the ways of objected, projected.

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:47.160
 It remain provide, but more than that, it remain in our consciousness, according to the Buddha's

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:53.320
 teaching, in our ally, a mental state, or self-confidence still our, or our self-confidence

00:25:53.320 --> 00:26:02.120
 still house of the space of the mind will remain for a long time. Long time. Then it's going to

00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:11.960
 activate more activities. Then it become cause of suffering truth. So this time when we pray,

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:20.440
 this both each other, boneless compassion, we pray. May all living beings pray from the suffering.

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:28.280
 Whatever they're going through, whatever the troubles, getting old, sicknesses, losing jobs,

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:35.880
 or whatever, depression, psychological, mental problems, loneliness, and what exactly whatever

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:43.800
 troubles, or fears, and all that, any troubles, all the whatever troubles of the old beings going

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:52.200
 through, had hell's ram, and hungry ghost rams, animal rams, human rams, asura rams, god's rams,

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:58.600
 whatever they're going, may they all finish, may all that. And then not just only the cause of

00:26:58.600 --> 00:26:58.840
 those

00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:08.280
 sufferings, completely finished, may all living beings have to pray from the suffering, cause of

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:18.920
 sufferings, suffering truths. And that is known as boneless compassion prayers, compassion. It is

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:28.120
 that. And this again, this loving kindness of compassion, these all are great powerful meditation,

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:34.520
 powerful mindfulness practices. When you have really intentioned that beautiful thought in your,

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:42.040
 our heart and mind, relax our mind, kind that prayer, even kind that prayer, and standing with

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:49.320
 our mind and heart behind that whole meaning, meaning is relaxed, it's so calming, it's soothing,

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:54.600
 it's relaxing, you're self-centered at that time. For yourself, your own being, through nature,

00:27:54.600 --> 00:28:01.720
 you're touching to your own heart, your own nature colors, your own beauties. It's so powerful,

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:08.440
 so benefit, it's also so precious, refreshing, it's really so powerful. You really think that,

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:17.080
 and then look to the horizon of the sky, in the space, or clothes, or trees, and the oceans,

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:24.750
 whatever you look, and look horizontally and giant that, reflecting your mind, heart, with those

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:25.000
 old

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:33.000
 meaning, and relax that. It is powerful. The moment you can feel power and benefit, but deep down

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:39.320
 according to what I take, it's horrifying, obscurations, obstacles, habitivity, cleaning

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:47.800
 our garments, negativities. It creates a beautiful evaporation energy to the universe, and art,

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:54.680
 you know, all that invisible things will feel. Animals will feel your love and compassion,

00:28:54.680 --> 00:29:01.160
 compassion, really, truly. It's not just saying those things, you can tell that. Then even you

00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:09.480
 look around the natures, it has new dimensions, new images, that you begin to explore the beauty

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:18.760
 of this. You see, you can test yourself, truly. It is, you're touching to your own

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:25.640
 nature, but at the same time, because of that, you see the beauty of the nature, of the external

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:36.120
 breathing self. And then next one, it's boneless. Boneless, rejoicing joy. How we do that prayer,

00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:44.280
 may all mother living beings have always happiness, never separated from their

00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:57.000
 supreme happiness. That is rejoice, or the joy, prayer of the joys. So again, this is boneless,

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:08.040
 again, prayer of the boneless joy. This joy is so, again, so powerful. It is, joy is the opposite

00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:17.000
 of the jealousness, and the opposite of the challenges, and those resentment attitudes.

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:27.160
 And we feel hope in you, because why? We pray always, may all living beings are free from suffering

00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:35.640
 and cause of sufferings, and may all they have happiness and cause of happiness. Now they are

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:43.400
 having some duty, they are having. Whether this power of our prayers, or power of their own

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:48.280
 activities and prayers, or power of the blessings of the Buddha or enlightenment,

00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:57.080
 whatever is those individuals are having some performance, enjoyment. Therefore, feel happy,

00:30:57.080 --> 00:31:03.800
 joy. And one way is, it's also sign of a performance of our own aspirations. Pray,

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:10.040
 because we pray every living beings have happiness, and now they have some happiness.

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:18.040
 It's really happiness, many times, this ego clinging, this substantial mind,

00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:25.640
 is kind of beaded or something, sometimes you feel bad, I don't want that, I don't

00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:33.000
 like to sit there happy. Peace, that is jealousness. But that's jealousy, what's going to help us?

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:42.840
 Help us is knocking our head to our own, our own feet, by our own feet, we're knocking to our own

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:49.240
 head. Head is not going to do anything, it's hurting to us.

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:57.320
 The temple has, it's hurting us now, it's hurting us in deep dome, we're creating negative karma.

00:31:57.320 --> 00:32:02.760
 And still that, really, this mother sent in beings, whoever they are, they are having some

00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:11.160
 fulfillment and happiness, and joy, so happy, that's their good karma, they're their good fortunate

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:11.160
,

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:18.120
 good. And also we pray, now, sometimes we see, see, maybe we did too some part,

00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:25.080
 some contribution toward that, toward that, very indirectly that, and you should be happy, our

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:32.200
 deep, our blessings, as I say, bless of the buddhas and bodhis, enlightenment, they perform good,

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:32.200
 good.

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:37.960
 But really, their happiness last for a long time, become more smooth, more happiness,

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:43.640
 more peaceful environment to the others, who already contract that, really wishing to pray.

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:53.640
 That is known as then, prayer practice of the boneless joy, this is. And then next one is boneless,

00:32:54.600 --> 00:33:02.520
 equanimity. Equanimity is again, we all, in many levels, we all equal.

00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:11.240
 What means we all? We all living beings are equal. What in the teaching said?

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:21.720
 Emotional level, we're equal. Feeling level, we are equal. Desire level, we're equal.

00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:31.080
 So we are all equal. In emotional level, we are equal, means everyone wants to be happy,

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:41.640
 everyone wants to be peaceful, everyone wants to have performance. So that is the emotional level,

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:49.720
 we are all equal. Equal, there's no really a difference. Nobody likes suffering,

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:55.800
 nobody likes the sadness, nobody likes the criticized, nobody likes to beat it,

00:33:55.800 --> 00:34:03.800
 nobody likes to be pushed away or pushed down. I mean, all the same. And then feeling level,

00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:12.360
 same. Nobody want to, want somebody beat us or somebody talk to us. I mean, same one. And also,

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:19.240
 we let me copy, feeling, peaceful, feeling, environment, nice, feeling level, same. I mean,

00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:27.640
 you can go through that all, everyone is equal. So physical, mentally, emotional level, biological

00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:37.240
 level, we all equal, go around this earth, all equal. Then what we share is also equal.

00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:46.520
 All elements are shared with equal level. The fire, we share the warmth, same warmth,

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:55.800
 we share same air, we share the same sky or spaces, we share the same wind. We all need water,

00:34:55.800 --> 00:35:04.120
 we all need earth. Earth, we all need everything, whatever we need, they need everything. So what

00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:04.280
 is

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:13.320
 really difference? Difference, reality level. So mental level, ego, emotional level, ego, what we

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:22.750
 share, the living, good level, livelihood level, ego, there is no difference, ego, same. So

00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:23.400
 therefore,

00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:37.080
 all, not everyone is equal. But however, even everyone is equal, we don't see that true picture,

00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:46.600
 what we are thanks to, because of our ego playing, so important. We make so many telling stories,

00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:58.360
 stories, and so many divisions, so many box, good, bad, friend, enemy, close ones, distance ones,

00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:04.280
 now all that, really we make art. And maybe that's true, some are close, some are distant,

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:10.760
 but we go, we act so strongly with that, and then we make kind of like friends and enemies and all

00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:21.800
 that, and so many differences. But who is making that? By our ego clinging, self-important. And who

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:34.920
 is that? Fundamental is our mind. Mind is making all those divisions, reality level, mind itself is

00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:46.520
 empty. Where is those in the mental status? The enemy, friend, this and that. Where is that?

00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:55.080
 There is no one came with sign of the enemies, enemies. There is no one came

00:36:55.080 --> 00:37:05.640
 sign or label or title of friends. It's all nominated by our mind. Our mind, the emptiness mind,

00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:13.720
 is mind. Said it does not exist at all, it also changes. Enemy can become the best friends,

00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:23.480
 best friend can become best enemy, because it's play game of the mind, then hold on that.

00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:37.000
 So reality level really is all blended in, same, equal, equal latest status. Our mind is making all

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:45.720
 those games, and mind is making all those territories, and mind is making them consequences

00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:52.520
 everywhere we are creating so many habit patterns, one after another. It's blocking the beauty of

00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:52.760
 our

00:37:52.760 --> 00:38:00.070
 mind, our nature of the mind, blocking that shining of love and complete, making those territories

00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:00.280
 of

00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:09.720
 the ego clinging. Then it makes more troubles to us, to all the beings. So therefore, being wise,

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:17.720
 and therefore brain, that equanimity, this realization is so important. For that reason,

00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:24.680
 may I bring, may I have the, how we join that place, and may all have the great

00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:34.520
 equanimity realization, close, attached to the close ones, and rejection attitude toward

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:41.240
 other beings. But how it translate? May they remain, may they remain, or may we remain. I mean,

00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:48.680
 here translated as a day, but it's we. May we, or may I. May I remain in the boneless

00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:58.360
 equanimity, free from both attachment to those close ones, and rejection of others. That is

00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:09.080
 may we remain. So this is again translated here, maybe there is not, Zali is really correct,

00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:17.400
 I believe, my understanding, because it's the may I remain. Or may we all remain in the boneless

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:23.720
 equanimity, not just this. That means it looks like I don't need myself. But we all need this

00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:30.760
 until, until we get the Buddhahood, or some Buddha is praying this one, maybe Buddha can say,

00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:37.400
 may they remain to all that. But I think it's that, until the Buddha, we need enlightenment,

00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:44.840
 we should pray to ourselves too. So we should remain in this circle, which remain in this

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:52.860
 stadium or rain. We should remain in our rain. We all need this praise. May we remain in the bon

00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:53.240
eless

00:39:53.240 --> 00:40:00.910
 equanimity, free from both attachment to the close ones, and rejection of others. That is really

00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:01.000
 the

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:07.880
 praise. And so this is, I mentioned really about our poor boneless, of course you all know this,

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:13.560
 nothing. But this is the one we, according to the practices, when you say that. But many,

00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:19.400
 and the teachings say that when you put practices, you should start with contemplating on the

00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:27.160
 equanimity first. If you don't do the equanimity first, first the teaching opens it, then the

00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:35.560
 boneless love, boneless compassion, boneless rejoicing won't come so boneless. Therefore,

00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:41.400
 start with the equanimity. Equanimity, when you put in practice, when you meditate in that. So

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:42.040
 first,

00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:47.960
 that is, I mean, what I say today is like, like just pray, but also this meditation,

00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:55.080
 meditate in this, and allowing kindness, and meditate on the compassion, meditate on the

00:40:55.080 --> 00:41:02.360
 rejoice and the joy, meditate on the equanimity, and meditate on the equanimity first. We are all

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:09.690
 equal. Everyone is equal. As myself and as everyone, really that equanimity, all those teachings

00:41:09.690 --> 00:41:10.440
 you put,

00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:16.840
 bring up more kind of like tangible meaning, and observe that in the heart, and then relax,

00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:22.520
 and have that equanimity meditation. Just challenge this prayer, and meditate it for

00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:29.480
 every time, for two minutes, or whatever your time. Just relax again. If you don't have the

00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:35.880
 worship, if you have time, just relax and meditate there. And that's how we build up this

00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:45.960
 vision for each other. And that is my brief talk, and again we continue to talk tomorrow, too.

00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:46.200
 Thank,

00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:58.600
 okay, thank everyone.

00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:20.040
 [silence]
