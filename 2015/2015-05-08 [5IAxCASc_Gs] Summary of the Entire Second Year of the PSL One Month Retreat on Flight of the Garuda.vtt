00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.880
 What this great Master now is, as I said, is VU, teachings on the VU. VU, meditation and conduct.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:19.280
 Among the three, we are again in VU. As I said the other day, or maybe many times, said,

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:25.320
 "What is meditation?" Meditation is maintaining the VU.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:32.920
 Maintaining the VU means keeping up the VU that you discover, or what you recognize.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:40.200
 That is meditation, keeping up the VU. And that means, for example, in the economy we go like just

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:47.640
 what we went a few days ago. What is it? Everything is mind. That was the great Master introduced.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:58.920
 So keeping up that realization is not false statement. It is not again making up statement.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:06.360
 Great Master pointed out so many ways. One after another, everything is mind.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:14.520
 All our perception, conception, appearance is mind. And again, we had also, we asked questions,

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.760
 any answers, all that things we made. Nobody has questions about that. So everybody knows.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:32.440
 It's really true. It is all mind. Perception is mind. Appearance is mind. It's true. All is mind.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:42.200
 Keeping up that realization is known as practicing. It's known as meditation.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:48.290
 That is not. It's meditation is not something, go different. Let's do something different than this

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.840
.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.800
 This is the meditation. Meditation in Tibet is called Gom. Great Master and K.K.I.A.R.A,

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:03.400
 would you make it many times? And I repeat it too. Meditation in Tibet means making familiar.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:11.160
 Making familiar. We make familiar because this time is not so familiar for us.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:19.230
 Because of dualities, we distracted and carried our force, deluded force for long, so many lif

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.960
etimes.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:28.040
 So when the nature is not so familiar, even though it rents to our heart, it's not so familiar.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:36.440
 But meditation means making familiar, familiar, familiar, familiar. And that is what meditation is.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:47.400
 So all is mind. Everything else is perception is mind. And if it is mind, so that is what it is.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:58.040
 Then what mind is? Then again, Great Master introduced, pointed out, mind is empty.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:07.400
 Again, he mentioned many ways he pointed out, I mean, instructions that you have booklet too.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:20.600
 Mind is empty. Again, recognize that and maintain that. It's meditation. That is what it is.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:28.040
 Keeping up that will. Again, everybody knows that. I think you all knew that. And there's no

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.520
 questions.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:36.360
 We had that. That means you know. You can't understand. It's true. There's nothing much to tell.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:46.040
 Mind is empty. This is what it is. And maintain that. Keeping it. And then what the mind is?

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:55.000
 Empty is what? Empty is mind is what? Introducing the appearance. Empty is the appearance.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.920
 And this is all we are kind of looking into our mind and introducing one after another this Great

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:01.560
 Master.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.840
 Or it's what he teaches. It's not something that we are going to do with different laboratories.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:13.480
 And it's trying to discover. We discover right with ourselves, right where we are sitting.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:25.800
 Sitting. All appearance is mind. Mind is empty. The emptiness is appearance or emptiness arising.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:35.000
 Ask a question. We did this. And that is again keeping up that realization. It's meditations.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.440
 And then appearance and emptiness has no difference. There's no separate entities at all.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:51.240
 It's a totally union status. Union status. It's one less status. It's inseparable status.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:05:01.240
 Great union status. That is what it is. Again we again Great Master said if you want to see

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:08.680
 appearance in the right side and emptiness in the right side, can you make that? Can we make that?

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:14.280
 Again we can't make. We can't really make the divisions of the emptiness in one side or appearance

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:21.800
 in one side. There's no separation. That is known as a union. It's separable status. Mind is the

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:27.560
 empty as is the empty is the appearance. As again I said and can't keep up the hero which is when

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:34.760
 it's time to say. Emptiness, great emptiness, it does not mean the black hole. Dark and cold and

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:35.960
 ice.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:48.200
 Ice is fullness and great openness. And that bring that realization. This is known as meditation.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:55.560
 Again I said that all opinion is the emptiness. Mind is the empty. All opinion is the mind

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.040
 and the mind is the emptiness, the emptiness, the appearance. Those are you know kind of stabilized

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:05.640
 stuff. But when we meditate, we don't have to ask although those are kind of analytic ways.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:13.000
 Even though key teaching is directly goes to the target, this is the analytic ways. True,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:21.240
 because we need confidence on our will. We need wisdom. We're not meditating with ignorance.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:30.120
 We don't meditate in the practice. We do wisdom, clarity, understanding, intelligence. Therefore,

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:38.040
 this simple inner realization brings back us to the nature as a coin in the Zen Mark Zen

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:44.920
 today I believe. It brings back to the nature immediately. So once you have established this,

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:50.920
 once you recognize this, I'm not saying you have to do every time. Ask these questions and do this.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:58.120
 And all that and simply relax. That's what great must. Relax without any effort.

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:07.480
 Relax, fresh. Without any concerns, play roles. No consumption, relax in the naked

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:13.560
 in that state. Without any effort. That when we maintain that will like that way,

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:19.640
 that is what is known as meditation. I'll repeat that again and again. It's meditation.

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:26.200
 That is known as practices. So now for example when we see things externally, appearance,

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:30.280
 all these things, even though they look so big and tangible and all these things,

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:37.400
 basically is display of our mind. Not chasing outside, pointing out these and that things,

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:43.720
 but practitioner beings, we should have. This is our mind. If there is something kind of certain

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:49.720
 temporary conditions played, then we can adjust that. But the blessing is really mine. So kind of

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:56.360
 like my confirmation, oh this is my mind. And then it's not hovering in the mind that solid

00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:03.160
 kind of structure, structure is happening. Mind is empty. Mind, that means total opening.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:11.800
 Open and infinite vastness, praise, as the great master used example, this sky.

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:19.880
 Sky even though it is not really the perfect example of the mind, but about the openness aspect,

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:29.000
 the space aspect, that is what mind is. So bring realization. Those are known as practices.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:35.080
 If needed, make those analyzations and come to the crucial levels.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:44.920
 Let's call it crucial levels. Come to the crucial level. If needed, otherwise relax with joy.

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:50.520
 Occasionally, the great master, master Karmacham is there. Now I say, occasionally bring up the

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:56.760
 devotees. Occasionally bring up the understanding of all these phenomena, abundance. Occasionally

00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:03.800
 bring up the great compassion of both each other to all things, but then rest back to that, that

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:09.800
 nature, the nature of the present status. So those are basically again, I just say that the mind

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.400
 of all this and now.
