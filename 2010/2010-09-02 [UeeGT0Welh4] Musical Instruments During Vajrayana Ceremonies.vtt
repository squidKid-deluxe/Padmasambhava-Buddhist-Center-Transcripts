00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:23.120
 "For example, like I'm going to do like this. For example, like that you know. This is called

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:30.680
 "Sundong" is three times a big beat and one time a small beat is called "Sundong" and

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:39.280
 you beat the drums. And this line, "Radiya Charya" with drums, not every sangha member

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:49.040
 will play the bells and the drums. Only "Radiya Charya" will play the drums. Sorry, "drummers"

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:55.320
 will play the bells. So you can beat the drums. But when we do this today, we all do it, "Radiya

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:02.720
 Charya". We do this, so this. And then there is called "Teng Song" and "Sundong". This

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:11.600
 is just, again, "Sundong" and that is like a barbecue. And this time we have the trumpet,

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:22.480
 conch shell and wands. Everything they play. So they play. But not the bell you can play

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:35.760
 or the "Vedetarya" is playing the bell. And then so here, the "Teng Song" is. And that's

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:56.240
 how you beat one drum. And then you beat one drum. And this is doing three times. So now

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:12.800
 three, three, two, second. And now do one more. That is three times "Bling Ling Ling" "Teng

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:22.880
 Song". Now we do this. This is used most of the time to invite the deities or the buddhas

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:47.920
 or the wisdom beings. So it's "M" okay. And then after that three times, finish it. And

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:54.960
 at that time, then, for example, "Vedetarya" are going to play the drums. So these four

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:04.080
 things is according to the philosophy of this, the wisdom beings are now prepared to rising

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:12.240
 up from their thrones. So when these "Teng Ling Ling" they are now really ready to prepare

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:18.960
 to come up, coming up, just getting up from their thrones and all that. When you do the

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:26.560
 "Vedetarya" that's fine. Now they are really arriving. Just arriving to the place, to the

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:34.480
 mandala. Right there, moving to that around. And then at that time, then everybody will

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:41.840
 call the trumpet is playing, also blowing and conscious blowing. And then also "Chopu"

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:49.600
 will tell where the head, head, and then where this essence carry around the temple, temple

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:58.720
 or around the mandalas. And then once that is up, then again we do this "Sompu".

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:12.720
 At that time, the idea is then the Buddhas are merged, sitting with the mandala or within

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:20.720
 yourself, now merged and become once in separate. So when we do this, this time, when we do this,

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:32.720
 that time, that we all play folks on this case, we all play the "Dhammaru" and build

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.120
 that continually. Once that is finished,

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:46.480
 from the last bit, small one bit, kind of two bit, at that moment, then Dhammaru will stop.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:53.920
 But continually you will drain the build and hold the Vedic heart center. And normally, again,

00:04:53.920 --> 00:05:01.120
 as I said, it's only done by the Vedic Jai. Vedic Jai, not everyone's. But in this case,

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:07.600
 we do this. So this Abunu, we really do this and beat the drums, many people will beat the drums.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:14.250
 I think we have four or five, six, three pairs of conscious shells and we blow the conscious shells

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:14.320
.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:19.920
 We have beautiful horn and beautiful trumpet, but I know that we are ready in the next time.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.160
 Of course, there is always need go.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:37.200
 And then we have this beautiful emoket we pray. I asked last night, like, "Laya and I,

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:43.440
 it is just beautiful." When you read this story, you're going to be able to lift you to bed in the

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:51.280
 department and then you ask, "How I can have that instant, that make something I call that blessing

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:56.480
 of you will come." I mean, it's a beautiful story, beautiful teaching there. So this is

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:03.920
 very considerate, powerful and special blessings. And so we join this, we join to release and then

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:13.440
 we beat the drum and we do our best. So that's it. And that is where we are. Okay. Thank you.
