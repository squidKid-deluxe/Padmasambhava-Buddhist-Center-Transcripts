00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 Everyone likes to be happy. Everyone likes to be peaceful. Everyone likes to be joyful.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 And everyone doesn't like suffering, sadness, difficulties. And that is just the same.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 Feeling level is the same. Need level is the same. Situations and circumstances are the same.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 But why does the difference? It's the only ego. That is then unimportant, this and that things.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.470
 So therefore, in the Buddha's teaching, when you practice bodhichitta, first is known as equalizing

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.000
 practices.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 "Dai yin yambai" in Tibet is equalizing. And then second is known as exchanging.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.570
 When you are actizing bodhichitta, exchanging, putting yourself, the other's position, and the

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.000
 other you bring to your position.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 Mentally, that poses all mental practices, mental training of the bodhichitta.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 Finally, then even others are more dear than the others. One's own self.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 And that's called "Dai yin yibai" in Tibet. The other is more dear, more precious than our self.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 There's a lot of stories. I mean, the poor Buddha Chakyamuni's story.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.020
 When you read life story of Buddha, poor life story of Buddha Chakyamuni's, how many times he did

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.000
 that practices.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 And then throughout his teaching, that's what he said when you read enlightenment.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.110
 And all those great masters in India, when you read their books and teachings and instructions,

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.000
 this is what all about.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 And in Tibet, when Dharma came, so many great masters did this practices. They did this.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 Not just his talk and saying, but his true practices.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 Through that, they conquered all these negative emotions.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.830
 They reached the permanent peace and happy and joyful status, and brought so many beings to this

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.000
 peaceful status.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 So those are known as actualizing bodhichitta practices.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.190
 So therefore again, bodhichitta, I'm going to summarize now, bodhichitta is so special, so

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.000
 important.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.470
 And that's why every practice hardener, when we do, there is rafuddhi practices, bodhichitta

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.000
 practices.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 Because they are the platform where the teaching is standard.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 They are the foundation where the teaching or our practice is best.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 And without that, there is no really Buddha teaching, no Buddhism.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 Without the rafuddhi, without the bodhichitta.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 And no Vedayana teachings, no Mahayana teachings, no Theravada teachings.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 And this is really so important.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:50.470
 And therefore, it is so special, and I'm very happy that I'm trying to tell a little bit about this

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.000
 reminder to each other.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 Again, there is nothing new. I'm mentioning that, but we all know basically.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.020
 But since we practice this, it's good to, as I said, it's a reminder to each other and try to stay

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.000
 in the course and then move forward.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 And so that is really teachings or talks on bodhichitta.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 And now I'm going to give some transmissions of these teachings and these practices.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 Thank you.
