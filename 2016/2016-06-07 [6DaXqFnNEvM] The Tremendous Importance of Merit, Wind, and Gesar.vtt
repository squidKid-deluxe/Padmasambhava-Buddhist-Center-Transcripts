00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.610
 "Dona" as in Tibetan Buddhism as "dungta" as translated into English as "raising up windhorse

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:10.400
 energy".

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:19.200
 What it actually means is "windhorse energy", right? Windhorse. Wind generally, as we all know, is

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.600
 one of the very powerful elements among the five elements.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:34.000
 There are five elements, wind, fire, water, earth, and sky. Those are the powerful elements.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:43.200
 Among those all five elements, the wind is the most active and powerful.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:53.600
 Actually, the sky or the space is allowing the all four of those elements after whom, activated.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:01.680
 So space is open, the openness of the space. Within that space, the four elements are activated,

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.400
 activity stages.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:10.800
 That's why all external world is here because of the four elements in space.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:17.200
 And our physical is here because of the space and four elements.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:24.800
 So whatever the visible things to see is four elements, according to Vedayana Buddhism or Buddhism.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.660
 There's nothing else. No matter, of course, we can use all the terminologies, divide it, many

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.400
 different these and that things.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:40.400
 But every brain is kind of summarizing all its four elements within the space.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:47.200
 Without the space, we won't move anything. There's no growth. Never going to do anything.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:56.800
 This space is allowing the openness, openness within the spaces, then four elements are active.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.000
 Among the four elements, as I said, wind is the most powerful.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:10.050
 According with Buddhism, for example, this universal world is residing in the space because of the

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.800
 wind.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:22.060
 Wind is holding up. Or in other words, maybe it's gravity, gravities, but not just only holding up,

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.200
 the world is moving.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.800
 The things are growing, things are changing. It's wind.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.400
 Wind is action. Wind is movement.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:42.400
 So here, among all the elements, we say, wind, raising of the wind horse energy.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:54.170
 And we have the perfect wind elements. Then it changes the fire, water, wind into the favorable

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.600
 cities.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:03.200
 It will cover that. And wind is disturbed. Everything will be crumbled. It won't happen.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:10.800
 So wind is so important. That's it. And our physical is best also on the wind.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.800
 Again, of course, space is there, but wind is so powerful.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:24.800
 With all the wind, there's nothing going to move. No matter if fire element is strong, fire, water,

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:30.400
 and earth all strong, but it will be changed.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:36.200
 Our physical is again not going to do anything because of wind.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:44.800
 This wind is that our life begins with wind and ends with wind. There's nothing else.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:55.250
 Wind is sustainable. And thinking of the global level, environment is also really best for the wind

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.800
.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:01.580
 Wind is disturbed. The element is disturbed. And then it starts disturbing the earth, all the other

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:02.400
 elements.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:09.690
 So wind is so powerful. Therefore, particularly in the Vedayana teaching, it says, raising of the

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.400
 wind horse energy.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:19.160
 And now there is now a sense of wind is so powerful. Sense of wind is so special and so crucial to

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.000
 our own existing, our well-being, and our everything.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 It's wind. And this time, we're going to change wind, something more positive, more virtuous.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:41.640
 That is what is known as raising of the wind horse energy. We're going to change wind in the

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.000
 positive status.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:52.080
 How? Generally in the Buddha's teaching that you heard, we heard always, things will be changed by

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.600
 performing the good deeds.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:04.170
 And that good deed, what is known as Buddhism, merit, merit, there's two merits, accumulation merit

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:07.200
, worst merit, two merits.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:15.450
 This both will change things. Why? Because everything is dependent upon the cause and the

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:18.200
 conditions and circumstances.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:24.830
 Without the cause and the conditions, nothing will grow, nothing will change, nothing will move

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:25.800
 anything.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:32.840
 But to create this beautiful substance and condition, things will change inevitably, without any

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.400
 doubt or hesitation.

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:43.190
 So merit, generally Buddha's terminology in the teaching, merit will change according to our desire

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:46.200
, which we like to move.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:51.930
 Therefore, do the merits. For those reasons, even our highest realization of the Buddhahood,

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:57.200
 enlightenment, comes by the merits.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:03.260
 But in the great teachings, always say, without the merit and by the devotion, the blessings by the

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.200
 devotions, realization won't grow.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:16.300
 The teaching says, with merit, that is also your devotion, which brings merit, combination of the

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:24.200
 merit and as well as devotion, realization shines from the heart as the sun is shining.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:31.240
 Shining. That's what the really teaching says. So merit is so important. Without merit, there's

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.200
 nothing will change.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:39.960
 Among all the merits, and then in the two accumulative merits, in very young teaching, so many

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:44.200
 skill means how to accumulate merit.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:55.560
 Raising of the wind hose energy is one of the most powerful skill means of the accumulative merit

00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:01.200
 rapidly, quickly, and that is what raising of the wind hose energy is.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:07.350
 And the wind hose energy also raising up according to very young teaching is cooperating with our

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:11.200
 elements, such as all the five elements.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:20.520
 This reflexes are cooperated with that, colors, five colors. Actually, this is all, everything is

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.200
 one way, best on the five.

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:33.620
 Five elements, five arrogance, and five senses, five emotions, five versitums, five colors, I mean

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:40.200
 entirely universe, all the samsara and the rana is within that frame state of the five.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:46.200
 It's not just Buddha man up there or somebody did that. That's what the nature is.

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:52.940
 And then, for example, ourself, also our physical looking, we have five organs, five aggregate or

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:59.200
 five inner organs, five senses, and then mentally speaking about five emotions, five versitums.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:11.030
 And then also wind level speaking, there's five different winds, produce wind, light force wind,

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:21.790
 and in that digestion wind, and downward moving wind, outward moving wind, those all controls our

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:26.200
 systems of the whole, even physical is fire.

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:32.200
 And then, for example, five senses, why five senses are so active?

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:38.410
 According to Buddhism, because of outward wind, if the wind is wrong, we're not going to move,

00:08:38.410 --> 00:08:41.200
 these five senses are not going to move.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:46.180
 That means we're not going to see, we're not going to hear, we're not going to smell, we're not

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:50.200
 going to taste, we're not going to feel or touch.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:58.520
 All is that, related with that. And this five-week video is full of skill for me, we're raising up

00:08:58.520 --> 00:08:59.200
 that.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:05.200
 Bring out glorifying biology out of the wind force, those vitalities.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:12.930
 Wind-wind force is strong, what that will do? It brings relaxation, joy, peace, happiness,

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:18.200
 prosperity, performance in our lives, and remove all obstacles,

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:24.200
 obscurations, negativeities, disturbances. We become more strong and powerful, like Gethse.

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:31.780
 Gethse was surrounded by all the obstacles, but one after another, he completely removed, cleared

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:33.200
 away everything.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:40.200
 He came up as a brilliant son, as the great master of modern music, a brilliant son behind clothes.

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:47.200
 Raising up the video, unmet, what's called matchless. Matchless is a shining power.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:55.720
 Warriors are not just coming because that happened. Warrior comes as we know, because of defeat and

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.200
 negative forces.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:03.690
 That's what the name called warriors. Warriors are not just born with warriors, but defeating,

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:07.200
 overpowering, conquering all obstacles,

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:15.080
 handedness, yet courage and commitment and determination remains strong, deep, and powerful as like

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:17.200
 mountain or as like ocean.

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:23.600
 And then love and kindness, compassion prevail with every direction and sunshine, light. That is

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.200
 what the warriors are, true warriors are.

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:33.420
 That was really this wind force, energies are, bring forward. So we had a great opportunity to do

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:36.200
 this every year in this beautiful rich land.

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:42.320
 Land and raising up this one horse energy. We are going to cooperate this, raising up the wind

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.200
 horse energy with Mahayana Buddhism,

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:49.460
 the essential teaching of the Buddha Chakra with gracious teachers, with love and kindness,

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:52.200
 compassion, bodhicata, not just only ourselves.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:57.800
 We do this for all the senses, to every living place. We really, which is strongly part of our

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:03.200
 heart, in the world there is peace, harmonious, and generous speaking.

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:09.200
 Individually speaking, may there is no more disease, sicknesses, getting old and difficult,

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.200
 troubles, declines, loneliness,

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:18.240
 depression, really we wish that removed all the way, cleared up and bring up such courage and

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:21.200
 commitment, joy, peace, happiness, and well-being.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:28.250
 Really, which is strongly. That is the practice. That is our teaching of the Buddha Chakra Muni,

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:30.200
 where the followers of the Buddha Chakra Muni is.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:35.000
 That is what the Buddha said. That is what we are doing. And by doing this, how many of those great

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.200
 masters achieve realization and fulfillment

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:44.230
 and bring them joy and peace, happiness, and both joy and peace to all mankind, all the living

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:47.200
 beings without any discriminations.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:52.810
 That is what really is teaching. So we really bring up that energy, that quality. We wish

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:55.200
 everything is good and best.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:59.200
 And we wish really sincerely from that. And that is bodhicata practice.

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:04.750
 And that is the combination of the Mahayana Sutra teaching and the essential teaching of the Mahay

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:05.200
ana Sutra,

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:10.910
 and the Vaidyana teaching combined together, we raise up this all, beautiful prayerfulness, or the

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:13.200
 raising of this wind horse, energies.

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:19.200
 And then really make that. Then wish everything. From now on, in the future, there is no more war,

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:22.200
 no more famine, no more natural disasters,

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:30.450
 no more sickness and famine. And wish every best things. And then really we are doing also in the

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:32.200
 individual level, what is teaching.

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:38.000
 If we do that, we are doing something meaningful in our lives. Life is precious. Life is so

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.200
 important. Life is so special.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:46.480
 But we make use of that to ourselves, to the beings. We are also contributing some good things to

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:47.200
 the world.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:53.200
 That is really good, to this country, to the beyond. And also to the whole country.

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:58.200
 We dedicated this marriage to all those who passed. This is called memory weekends.

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:05.290
 Memory, the best memory weekend is doing the good activities with positive thought and dedicated to

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:06.200
 that all living beings.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:11.560
 To everyone in the past and present future. I think that is one of the great memory weekends that

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:15.200
 we can do in our life and our self.

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:20.530
 It is something special. And all the buddhas and bodhisattvas, every enlightenment we will reduce,

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:24.200
 embrace our deed, our thought and intention while we are doing that.

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:30.660
 Truly we are following with the footsteps of these great ancient masters or the warriors that who

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:36.200
 defeated all the obstacles of the samsara, samsara and the reach to the Buddhahood enlightenment.

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:43.410
 So that is what we will do. And that is really my introduction of this wind raising of the wind

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:44.200
 horse.

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:48.200
 And now we do short again the blessings of this.

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:54.200
 And again this is the very honor teaching, teaching Murugama sama to bless that with the kakana.

00:13:54.200 --> 00:14:00.730
 As is already presented by beautifully this all the buddhas, sakrits, all the Murugama sama and the

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:02.200
 laga, the masters.

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:09.200
 But as it is still we reaffirm, reassure as the instructor by the buddha and Murugama sama.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:16.200
 So we do that short again our deed and we do this.

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:23.240
 So then we will raise up the wind horse, we do motivation, up and now then we will also do the fire

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:24.200
 period again.

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:30.480
 This is the raising of the wind horse and we really remove the obstacles and disease sicknesses and

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:35.200
 also cleanse up the environment, all those pollutions.

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:41.200
 So we clean up the pollutions of the external, we cleanse the pollution of our inner mental state,

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:47.200
 clear with that so that everything becomes so clear in a beautiful pristine state.

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:50.200
 Really those are the meaning of this phrase.

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:55.200
 So that whole deed is our practice outside, inside, all this activity.

00:14:55.200 --> 00:15:01.200
 What is the teaching say? Meditation or practice state is post meditation or practice state.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:07.200
 So we are not dividing this and that, the whole thing as a practice state.
