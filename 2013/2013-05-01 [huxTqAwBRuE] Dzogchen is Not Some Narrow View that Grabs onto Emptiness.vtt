00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680
 "Not partiality, these and that, things. We are not kind of like, narrowly cornered,

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:13.600
 like a Dzocchi mind in some way and there, nothing we need. And we do that, we are discriminating

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:19.360
 the display of the three Gaius. That is not the correct practice, you know, that's what we're

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:27.520
 learning in teachings. Therefore, Dzocchi means we're compromising, or we bring everything.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:36.160
 We are embracing everything as part of the display. That is the beauty, samsara and the

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:43.120
 rana, all in that night, that status, that great status. And that is what the Dzocchi is.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:50.080
 Therefore, to bring that result, we have to bring, capture, we have to start that. Therefore,

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:57.760
 we're practicing, entirely Buddha's teaching, without losing one single word for the Buddha.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:04.640
 The greatest teacher, Buddha spoke. That's what every great master said. We're never going to miss

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:11.920
 the Hinayana teaching, Mayana teaching, Vedayana teaching, embracing everything as part of the

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:18.480
 growth, part of the development, part of the itself. That, when we do, then true, we are

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:25.200
 practicing with Dzocchi. Not Hinayana practitioner, not Mahayana practitioner or Sothar Mahayana

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.960
 practitioner, we're true Dzocchi practicing. As we are cornered in narrow mind, in Dzocchi thinking

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:32.080
,

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.040
 Dzocchi practice, something is completely different. That is narrow mind. That is not

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.080
 Dzocchi, what we are learning here. That's not what the Buddha summoned about speaking. That's

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.680
 not what the Buddha, Buddha Shakyamuni said. That's not the Garab Durya saying, Hirisala,

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:55.520
 Manjichirimata, all those great minds, never seen. That is not saying that Dzocchi's words,

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:03.680
 but we are narrow, small mind. Small mind, we are following extreme stages. Thinking of the Dzocchi

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.680
,

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.680
 we are following another edge, another extremes. So therefore, we're going to come, bring,

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.640
 embrace, as I said, bring all the teaching. That's what the great master says. That's

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.320
 what the Gethi, what the Hirarung, he said so many times. I heard this from his only Durya,

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.440
 so many times. You read books of the his only Dzocchi. You read books of the,

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.640
 of the papa rambutas, mass papa rambutas, Dzocchi great teacher, force with chenze,

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.400
 force and control, and Mahara rambutas. Every one of those great Dzocchi masters,

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.960
 the practice who practice rich enlightenment, they embracing everything, everything and both

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:50.560
 in one single state. That's how they explore the beauty and the quality of the three guys,

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:59.280
 of our very own natural beauty. And that is what, how we're going to practice. To do that, again,

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:05.600
 great teacher, the lineage of masters, both every Buddha teaching in one simple way so that we can

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:11.680
 put practices, and that is known as the Kundra practice. So therefore, I'm actually encouraging

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:19.680
 always, and you do myself too, we all need to practice. Kundra is our practice, the beginning

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:28.480
 practices. Kundra is the middle practices. Kundra is our complete practices. This is what we're

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:28.720
 going

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:37.360
 for. It is foundation practices, it is structural practices, it is finicky practices. When we have

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.960
 the foundation, Kundra is a foundation, is laying the perfect foundation, perfect foundation. When

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:49.520
 we start building up the building, the same material that we do too, you know, same material,

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:55.840
 same thing what we use the foundation, use to build up the buildings. And the same material,

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:02.560
 same similar things we use to put the finishing type, roots and everything. That is the how we do.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:09.360
 In all the levels, all the level, and therefore here, the Kundra practice, that is very important.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:17.440
 With the Jockey practice combined, look at that, makes perfect fuel, perfect to lift up from the

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:25.680
 samsara and to the nirvana, and transforming samsara itself as the nirvana states. And therefore,

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:32.480
 again, this Kundra is so important, so special, and this Kundra is divided into four, two groups,

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:39.520
 two major groups. First is the general Kundra practice, which based on the Four Reynolds act

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:45.920
 of thought, or portraying of the mind, all four different therapies of the mind. We're doing

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:52.960
 therapies, therapies from the duality, from the regiment of the ego-clinging, regiment of the

00:04:52.960 --> 00:05:01.040
 grasping, clinging, clinging, and that is what we're doing. So therefore, this Four Reynolds act of

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:10.160
 thought is immediately like therapists, therapy to the mind. It makes gentle, peaceful, soft,

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:17.120
 practical, and looking close to the way things are, so then we can grow, we can develop. And from

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.520
 that,

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:24.080
 right after that practice, reflected that thought, and then we begin the practice itself. And that

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:29.820
 is known as then, then rafuj. Rafuj is the essence of the entire Buddha's teaching, and

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:30.400
 particularly

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:38.000
 connected to the Hinayana teachings. It is essence of that all. And this is the essence of the Mah

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.400
ayana

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:44.400
 teachings, that you all know and understand in that course. And today, I'm going to talk about

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.680
 the mandala practices. It depends with the Kundal practice you do. The short Kundal, which is

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:58.240
 mandala, is the hardest place, hard place. So follow according that. And some more than the

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:04.880
 Kundal practices is mandala is in fourth, fourth, various other kinds of fourths. But this time,

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:12.400
 as a short Kundal, that system is in fourth, or so in third, third level. And we talk about the

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.400
 the mandala. The mandala is...
