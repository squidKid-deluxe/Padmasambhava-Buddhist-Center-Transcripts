00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.880
 Welcome, welcome again everyone. Thank you. And again, as a historian said, and a grader,

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:13.200
 our master, K.T. Vardheesh Ramaji always said, this is one of the great opportunities in our lives,

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:20.000
 that we are really truly engaging to the essence of our own nature, through the teaching of the

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.240
 Buddha Shaptamuni. All this is not just for accidental, truly we are blessed, truly. Therefore,

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:35.680
 respect and endure in the applications. At the same time, have the determination, courage,

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.980
 and commitment to explore our beauty, our natural, and radiating that energy to all our

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.200
 environments,

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.760
 to everywhere, to everywhere, everywhere. We really cannot do that, very strongly in the deep

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:56.560
 heart and mind. Strongly, truly this is what the teaching of this is. We're teaching is not just,

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.440
 we are practicing teaching, following, to be nice with Buddha, or to the lineage masters,

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.800
 or someone else. Truly this is our nature. We are exploring that. We are glorifying that.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:14.400
 We are revering that. Buddha pointed out, hey, we all, you all have the treasures.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.240
 You have all the treasures. Now is the time to revere. Buddha is not going to, or the body

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.440
 is not going to revere for us. They are going to show and tell us how to do.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.920
 We have to put our effort, joy, courage, and commitment to revere these natures.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:38.560
 These are all wonderful opportunities. We all, every way, every aspect we think, we have the

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:45.120
 path of opportunity, path of the situation, path of the circumstances. These all not just came

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:53.040
 by itself or coincidentally. Truly it has beautiful cause and conditions. Our good

00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:01.120
 karma of the past did and a lineage blessings. All that combined together, we are here to engage,

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.640
 to explore our beautiful nature as Buddha told, as the lineage masters told,

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.240
 our best capabilities. We're going to revere one after another. That's it. So therefore,

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:19.920
 we strengthen our again with joy and appreciation. At the same time, bodhicata told vastness,

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:26.560
 motivation of the bodhicata, thinking all living beings may truly, may they remove from all

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.960
 suffering

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:33.760
 the difficulties, may they remove from all the wrong ideas, wrong beliefs, bring them joy and

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.200
 peace, shine them to greater wisdom, those who have wrong beliefs, really have greater wisdom,

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.880
 decent respect of lives of every living beings, of joy and peace and happiness.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:51.840
 Kids strongly wicked that. That is our way to contributing the world peace and helping benefit

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:58.400
 that our prayers and combined with bodhicata. And we do that together. Blessings of the

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.080
 Buddhas and bodhisattvas makes more powerful. They are already working. We join in their ripple

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:10.320
 effect, chain reaction of the beautiful energy, vibrating throughout the gloves and beyond the

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:16.480
 gloves. That is what really we need to do. And the target with this vastness, motivation of both

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.800
 each other, as you all know, we are very unpractical. Bring out of this apart from the

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:30.560
 understanding of the purity of the three various states, various forms, various sounds and various

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.840
 minds. We heard these things so many from great teachers, so many great teachers from

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.360
 and from KK, but they share numbers. We know intellectually, vaguely, vaguely in the brain,

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:48.720
 let that say all those knowledge in the heart with joy and devotions. That is what's called

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:55.920
 practices, not hovering in the brain, any kind of idea in the conceptual level. That is not called

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:03.040
 the practices in by the practicing lineages. That is just the idea. Of course it will help a bit,

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:09.840
 but really it's not going to make the change. So let's say all those are beautiful, say within

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.680
 the heart, let them merge with our primordial nature, but we're going to discuss, nerd that

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:24.640
 and explore, bring the explosion of the realization from through our body, speech and mind and

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.040
 shine

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:33.280
 to the every direction. That is known as fearless yogi and yogi-ness or the true heroics. They are

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.720
 the warriors of the individual world. They were warriors of the inner pardo. They were warriors

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:46.240
 of the upward pardo or this life, next life, all the way to the enlightenment. They are warriors

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:53.360
 of the bodhicata, warriors of love, kindness, compassion, wisdom, respect and appreciation

00:04:53.360 --> 00:05:01.200
 to every living beings. During that energy, energy in mandala, within that, that's the guru target.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:07.120
 That is the message and teaching of the Buddha, Gaurapayama sambhava, our great kenji,

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:13.440
 vardhika, rambhoji and his only dalai rambhoji. Truly that. That's what they be practices and

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:19.440
 we are following that footsteps. Not just only them, all the great masters, such as his only dalai

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:25.760
 rambhoji. Look at this, how wonderful activity that is performed, performing, benefiting and

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:34.160
 genuinely love, compassion, understanding, passion or tolerance. All these dudes are teaching.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:40.640
 Of course, verbal teachings are teaching too, but those example stories are great teachings.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:46.320
 They are not just talkers, but they are duels. They are standing what they are talking,

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:54.960
 behind it, firmly and that. And that is what we are able to do this. Truly then we are beautiful,

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.360
 we are perfect. So kind of bring up those understand that this is mind of course.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:04.480
 Again, we are all Sangha members, as you always said, we are all Sangha members. What the teaching

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:10.480
 says in Sangha members, support each other, help each other. Anywhere, I am reminded to you

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:16.480
 and I am reminded to myself. We are all reminded to each other, support, help and move forward

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:22.640
 with a beautiful goal, with a vision and move forward. That is known as, again, in the Buddha

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:29.760
 seeking what is said, noble doro, noble sanghas. Noble sanghas and noble doro. That will make that

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:36.720
 noble, noble it is. Noble it is. It is not a noble, noble it is not just a bone in the title of it,

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:44.000
 but it is love, kindness and compassion. Understand that is noble, that is noble it is,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.280
 highest noble. Therefore, what the in the teaching says, there is nothing higher noble than the

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:49.520
 true

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:55.920
 love and compassion, joy and appreciation. There is nothing else. All others are hallucinations,

00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:01.280
 it is titles, it is all relatives, more hallucination than even relatives.

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:08.080
 But this is wonderful, joy and appreciation. So bring up those beautiful qualities and then

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.600
 Then we move to the teaching of this time.
