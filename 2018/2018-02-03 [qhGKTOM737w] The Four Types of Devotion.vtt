00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.540
 This meditation, as I said, this is the most powerful and the most simple set and the most

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:15.540
 kind of like pagan, ordinary, niri, Dzogchenese that yet is so powerful. For that reason, it needs

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.240
 that lunch, lunch bed.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:25.380
 Lunch bed, what we use it for. And we don't have that lunch bed, because due to our habit of

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:34.990
 the duality, we can spoil the talk to the teacher. We can spoil it. For that reason, lunch bed,

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.340
 what we

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:43.540
 discussed yesterday really, but basically you all know that lunch bed is needed. Lunch bed, that

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.860
 lunch

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:54.780
 bed is starting with yoga, bodhicitta, and purely understanding, devotions. That's all we need.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:02.400
 Again, we're talking of the devotions, and I know many people don't feel comfortable with the dev

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.580
otions,

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:13.420
 many times. But what is really devotions generally? Postable devotion, as I said, it is joy and

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:22.800
 appreciation, fear, preciousness, and trust. That is the one that devotion is. The greatest

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:23.440
 kindness,

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:29.620
 compassion teacher, Buddha Chaitanya Mune, actually divided this devotion into three parts, three

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:30.220
 sections,

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:36.580
 three kinds of devotions. So maybe that will bring a little more understanding to what you will be

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:44.810
 talking of the devotions. First devotion is known as devotion of the interesting, interesting dev

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:45.280
otions.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:56.220
 Second devotion is known as desiring devotions. Third devotion is known as trusting devotions.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:08.380
 Those are three devotions. Everyone who comes here, they all have that interesting devotions.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:17.620
 What means enter as a devotee? Enter on that topic, enter instead of on the teaching. That,

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.670
 actually, is the motivation, and it's according to the Buddha's teaching. That is devotion. Coming

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.780
 to

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:30.530
 the teaching, listening to the teaching, trying to explore, you have some joyous space. Joyous

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.940
 space,

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:41.240
 you end up that boat to the place. You listen and reflect it. That is known as interesting devotees

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.420
.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:50.620
 So we all have that. Second devotion is desiring devotion. Desiring devotion means now not just

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:56.140
 interesting, you're not just interested, but you're desiring. You're actually no more. You have to

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:07.220
 explore more. You feel more comfortable. You have to know more, more and more. Even in some cases,

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:14.620
 I like to become like that. Having that attitude, having that thought, where it comes from,

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.860
 very developed, from the interesting devotees, because you're interested, and now interested,

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:26.620
 you become stronger in the desire you like to be. You have a desire that you like to be,

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:36.940
 not more, and you like to see more. That's called desiring devotion. Third one is trusting

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:46.420
 devotees. That is strong. Now many of people can maybe have difficulty with that. You have

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.940
 definitely,

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:53.100
 we all have the interesting devotion. We have the desiring devotion. That is no doubt, that's

00:03:53.100 --> 00:04:01.340
 what best thing to be here. But this trusting devotion, that is many times, we are like

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:07.980
 lingering, many times people sometimes are lingering. That also, if you look at the measurement

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:15.420
 of that, and for example, the percentage. If you take the percentage, how much you trust it,

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:24.460
 how much you don't trust. So you do this, this is the democratic country. How much you trust it,

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:30.940
 percentage, how much you don't trust. If you look, most people who are saying those things,

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:40.220
 they definitely trust maybe 50%, 60%, 70%. They really trust it. But maybe they're not 100%.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.340
 So therefore, actually you are the meaning of the devotees.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:57.500
 50 and 60 or 51 and 60, 60 and 50. So definitely, we can say, I don't have devotion. You definitely

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.500
,

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:05.420
 you have devotion. Devotion. So this is because of the, you're interesting because of your, your,

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:13.500
 your desiring. That means joy and appreciating. Sometimes I like to know that. And trusting.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:20.940
 And the great master Nirmal Namba added one more after the trusting. The unreturnable devotees.

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:31.180
 Unreturnable. That means completely strong now. Strong, unfailable or non-reversible devotees.

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:37.900
 That is, many times even we have the devotion, even we trust for a short time,

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:44.380
 but it's lingering and it changes. Changes, and then we can completely become different things.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:53.180
 But what the great master Nirmal Namba added, poor, un-non-returnable, non-returnable devotees.

00:05:53.180 --> 00:06:02.380
 You have that. That individually is definitely going to win what you're practicing.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:09.900
 What you're doing. Because all these achievements, all proponents are dependent on our,

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:17.580
 our, how strength we put out to our mind, to the mind. How strength of our mind is put into the,

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:24.620
 to the practice of, or to the, to our goal. Cool. It's actually according to you master,

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:31.980
 you heard so many times, according to Buddhism, all is created by mind. Ordinarily, and now,

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:41.900
 in the future. So when you have that strong, unreversible devotions, definitely you're going

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:53.740
 to win. Football exactly as what you're doing. Because of how the mind is 100% behind of that,

00:06:54.620 --> 00:07:04.140
 this practices, or this goal, or your activities. Activities. This is not just only, also in the,

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:11.340
 in the Dharma level, but when you have the trust and confidence, and if you perform some activity

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:16.780
 with it, with this kind of gentle and peaceful skillful ways, definitely you're going to

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:24.140
 perform the goal in the samsara team. And more balanced skillful. It's not just in the Dharma,

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:30.060
 in the samsara, in the world, academic, or world level. If you have the courage and commitment

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:37.100
 and confidence, you're going to, you're going to win every, every, every apply the skillful meaning

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:37.100
,

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:44.140
 and apart good talent, good, good thought with that. Because of cause in there, conditions there,

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:51.980
 you're going to perform. Football, that is the one. And there is one story, ancient times,

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:58.860
 very famous, one of the very famous Sanskrit, Sanskrit masters. Sanskrit language is considered

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:05.580
 divine language, and there's so many great masters who came, who become expert on Sanskrit.

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:15.820
 There is known as Vamsi Pani, Brahma Boy, Boy Vamsi Pani, Pani. Pani, when he was young,

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:24.300
 he went to the, to the palm readers, palm readers. And he said, he asked, "Please read my arms."

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:30.940
 So this palm reader read the palm, because his desire is he like to become the master of the

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:39.340
 language. So he said, "I can be master of the language, man, or Sanskrit language, and palm

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:46.300
 reader look the palm and look it, I don't, you can become. You cannot become, because sign and

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:54.140
 indication don't make it." And he gets so upset. Why I'm not going to become that? He created his

00:08:54.140 --> 00:09:01.580
 own palm pen by knife. Amen, whatever he needed to do. He really created one. And he started,

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:10.140
 started Sanskrit. He become the one of the most famous Sanskrit master that still echoing his,

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:18.620
 his talent, his word, and his expertise on the language, known as Vamsi Pani, Vamsi Pani.

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:23.900
 So that is one of the examples, not just the only. When you have that determination,

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:30.380
 courage and commitment, applying your wisdom technique, according to that, definitely you

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:37.740
 can achieve things. That is what is. So therefore, when we meditate in practice, according to our

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:44.380
 degree of devotion, really standing there. Really standing there in the practice. Because practice

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:49.820
 in Dharma, meditate in the Dharma, is nothing we are doing, aliens. You can read, you can see,

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:56.620
 it's completely laid out, laid out, right in front of us. We explore in the loving kindness,

00:09:56.620 --> 00:10:02.780
 compassion, versus us. And we are releasing the grasping, clinging, negative emotions,

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:10.460
 which is a disturbance, universally proved. This negative emotion is bad. Whether you are a

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:15.820
 believer or not a believer, this negative emotion, I don't want everybody to think it's bad, good.

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:23.340
 Nobody, I don't want to think that. When you're raging at the video of the negative emotions,

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:29.100
 anger, attachment, jealous, hated thoughts, self-importance, sub-spirit thoughts,

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:38.380
 if that action turns out, anybody, I don't want to say anything, is great. Great. So we're taking

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:45.050
 care of that, removing that, blending, removing that, and bringing up our inner beautiful qualities

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:45.340
.

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:56.140
 This is not something that we're doing so to please someone as I said. We're really doing that for

00:10:56.140 --> 00:11:02.700
 ourselves, for our families, friends. And we like to have peace, for harmony, good friendships.

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:09.740
 Times are about loving kindness, compassion. Bar of compassion, what's called? B-A-R, right? Bar.

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:19.260
 Raise up the bar of compassion, raise up the bar of loving kindness, raise up bar of the harmony,

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:24.220
 then appreciation. We don't have to worry, we don't have to. No, we're not going to,

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:30.700
 we're not going to be free, friendless. Definitely, you have bundles of friends. Your telephone,

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:37.980
 your telephone is, and this, your iPhone is ringing. Then you will say, "Oh, it's too much.

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:44.620
 I have to put up. Oh, I like to be with you. Can I come see you, be with you?" All that, really,

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:50.860
 all that. And we have this love and kindness, compassion. This is our inner body, right?

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:59.580
 Naturally, everybody is happy because it's so beautiful, so sweet. It's good because it also

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:05.660
 is an effort to them because they have that too. It's just an effort. It becomes so natural. It's

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:12.780
 natural, not just become natural. So then, it is natural. And natural is bouncing back and nice and

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:18.780
 beautiful. And the other hand, if we have negative emotions, it's bouncing like that. Even we want

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:23.660
 friendships. Even we have good things, kind of attitude, self-importance, and some of this and

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:28.620
 that thing, anything, you know, all these things. And even you want friendship, it's kind of going

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:34.620
 to go away quite further and further. I don't like to be with you because a person doesn't mean

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:42.780
 uncomfortable, unkind, and his breath, so much emotions, and so much restless status. Why should

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:50.460
 it be? That's a really good thing. It's not just total stories. It's true. It's all different with

00:12:50.460 --> 00:13:00.380
 these colors of our inner beliefs. So to discover this nature, relax, and relax as a jokic. Relax.
