00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.400
 Pad Aiden, and here, I think we stopped yesterday, you have arrived at the awareness of the egoless

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.000
 which is the "sharp vedra"

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 to have arrived to the awareness that remains as actualized groans.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 So if I roughly translate this, the awareness of the egoless which is the "sharp vedra", that's it.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:45.760
 To actualize it, then we are reaching the peak of the awareness and that is reached to the final

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.000
 goal, the final goal of the nature.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:57.570
 That is a kind of roughly translation, but I make it. In order to do that, then we have to practice

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.000
.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 We have to now practice. We do learn the teaching and then do the practices.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 And the practices, as I mentioned yesterday in the Great Master Umm Khimba and not just Umm Khimba,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 but all the masters say everyone teaches the same thing in the lineage. Then those three novels,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 the beginning novel, the middle novel, and the concluding novel.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.090
 Every session of the practice follows with three novels. The beginning novel is with beautiful

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.000
 intention.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:45.210
 Intention with rafu, bodhijata, and porenosa, as well as devotion to the teaching with full of

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.000
 confidence and those are the beginning.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 And the middle is practice itself, principle practices.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 This practice, in the Vijayana teaching, there are two practices.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 The creative stage practices and the completion stage practices.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 The creation stage practices are also known as visualization practices, such as sadhanas.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 We do sadhana practices. That is the visualization, which is meditation.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:28.210
 Which is zokkin meditation, chamat meditation. Zokkin is like brain emptiness. Zokkin is, as the

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.000
 teaching says, its appearance.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 So zokkin is what? Relative truth, absolute truth, union.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 And this is the creation stage practice is relative truth, purity.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 Relative truth is, as we just mentioned, is all enlightened.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 Relative truth is enlightened.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 Of course, with duality, when we dilute with duality, it is impure.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 There are so many different things.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 And when we don't have duality, it is enlightened.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 And those are the teachings, always. And it is also mentioned in later here, too.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 All enlightened. I will go later here to that. All enlightened.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 That is the creative stage of the Vijayana, relative truth practices, where purity is.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 Then, the completion stage practices of the two stages is zokkin meditation.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 Completing stage practices mean the great absolute truth practices.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 Completely means what? There is nothing left behind, the all-encompassing.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 Where does that encompass it? As in the teaching case, so many times, in the great emptiness.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 Great emptiness is not external. Great emptiness is dharmakaya, nature of our own mind.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 Within is our nature of the mind, of the emptiness, that everything is complete.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 What is our own everything? In Buddhism, what we said, samsara, nirvana, and path.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 Path to the nirvana. So samsara is completed in one's own awareness.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 Nirvana is complete in one's own awareness. All the path in the bhoomis, in the teaching method,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 that is also uncompleted in one's own awareness. Nothing is excluded.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 Nothing is not pervaded. It is all that.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 Entire samsara, nirvana, path in the Tibet is called kunde, lamsam.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 Kaurva, young in the neighborhood, lamp, then again said, even the lamp dreevichu,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 all the resolved achievements are completed in this, once on awareness.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 That is known as zhok chin meditation, complete zhok chin, zhok chambo in the Tibet.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 Shri Durya, all it is, as is yesterday, I'm not just immune in the teaching method,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 zhok chambo, all that is Shri Durya's number, dathangrata, garbha, is all same.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 O Pandya Para Mata, all those same nature, the great emptiness, the ordinary nature,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 the pure from the beginning, all that is really the nature of that.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 So that's what the principal practices.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 Really, that you follow the sadhana, you receive teachings on the sadhana and practice.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 That sadhana practice is also union of both creation state and completion state.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 Visualization and completion state, both are union.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 It's not separate, because why?

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 Two truths are not separate.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
 Two truths are one.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 Relate truth is absolute truth.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 Absolute truth is relative, according to teaching in all masters.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 It is the same.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 There are no two different entities in the Sai Bhai's existence.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 It is all one.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 And as I mentioned, the great master and the earlier I mentioned,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 there is no emptiness or absolute truth besides relative truth.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 Relative truth is what we see, all these things.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 Phone, song, smell, taste, touch and mind.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 All this mass, matter, mind, all this is relative.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:36.000
 That this relative truth, nature is inseparable with emptiness.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 Emptiness, openness, freedom, flexible, translucent.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 And money, that is what the old emptiness is.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 That is the emptiness.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 It's not the emptiness of blame, convert, many times.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
 When we have duality, thought emptiness means why can't?

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000
 Emptiness, blame has not known.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 In the teaching, emptiness is a pool of fullness.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
 A pool of fullness.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 What a pool?

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
 All that is free.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 That emptiness is full of samsara.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:27.000
 Emptiness is a pool of paths and mountainous is a pool of nirvana.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 Also there are not three different components, departments,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 or to be different, all in the same thing.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 See, how wonderful.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 How do you make them?

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 In the teaching, he said, really.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 Even his emptiness, all that, but all this karma,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 all this, this, this all displays are just happened by him.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.000
 Don't any blockage and stop him or short it.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
 For that reason, a great master earlier said, how amazing.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 He said, is more than amazing, more than awesome.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
 Have you really think, truly?

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
 That's how the nature is.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 That is our mind.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:22.000
 The nature of this mind, all displayed, yet never lost its qualities.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
 It is identity of that.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 For those reasons, great master, Don Kimba said,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 all the beings of six realms went through ups and downs,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 all of that, but reality level, they never moved

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 for one day from the true nature.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
 Never moved, never changed.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 It's all that.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 Why that happening?

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 It's all, we all go through challenges.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 It's delusions.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
 That's what the great master, Don Kimba,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 we talked for a second, he has to tell you.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
 As long as we have the duality,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 that long there is karma.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 There is as long as the duality,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
 there is long there is inter-disappearance

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
 and the karmas and this and that.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:27.000
 Therefore, should not ignore the karma,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 should not ignore those cause and effect.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000
 As long as duality, not just having small realization

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
 and something, ignore.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
 No, we create more obscuring.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 It will become as like karmas.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
 Here we burden to the wind.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 We put the kind of leather stones or something

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 to our wing or to the wing of the bird.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
 Bird cannot fly.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
 It stops.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 Similarly, any negative activity is smallest things.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 That will prevent and block it,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000
 our realization understands and advances.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 Therefore, always be taught for every action.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 Be taught with every action.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000
 With mindfulness, thoughtfulness, alertness.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 Use all that and then be safe with very real

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 and calm and peaceful on the right course

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
 as much as we can do.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 That is known as practicing.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
 Practice. We need practice.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
 We need practice. We're not enlightened.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
 We're going through the Doki teaching and all that thing,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 but we're not there yet.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000
 We're just trying to change the course of duality.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 We carry the right course of duality from the biggest time.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
 Carry that.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 And now, by the teachings of the greatest teacher,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 Buddha Chakra Muni in the world of Amazon,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 lineage, in a way, we're saying enough is enough.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 Now we're going to turn the waves our directions,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 the origin of your natural direction.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
 Think of that.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 Therefore, this is all so, so important to be, even though you have...

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
 So therefore, what they say in the teaching of Akram said,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 carrying the wool on the mouth,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 carrying the wool on the mouth, not in the heart.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
 Then we can make mistakes.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 There are so many stories in the teaching that really made mistakes.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
 People practicing with mistakes and thinking maybe it's okay.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 They say, "Okay, all that, that." Then we lost it.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 All of a sudden, the teaching said...

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 An early part of the teaching said there is a delay, a mistake,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 and I lost three things here.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:26.000
 The first chapter, the second, is said here in...

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 Oh yeah, here, here.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:40.000
 And it's said in page 12.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:46.000
 Therefore, which cut the arrows, divisions,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:53.000
 and always don't have the next one.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:59.000
 But it's always said three things in the practicing that we can do, mistakes.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:06.000
 Those are mistakes of the here translated, deviating, deviating, or that.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:12.000
 And then, in a little bit, there is a korwa, shorwa, and novwa.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
 Kor, shor, kor, shor, norsam.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 Kor means deleted, maybe deviated.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 Shor means lost, and noram means mistakes.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
 Shor means what?

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000
 Shorwa is like that many times in the teaching mentioned.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
 Shorwa, we carried the blue on the mark,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 and then acted that to kind of intellectually understand

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 what we know a little bit intellectually that,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 and carried that in action, and do things.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
 And such as...

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:59.000
 And we carried the blue on the mark, or there is no kana.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000
 There is no cause, no condition, no samsara, no nirvana.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 Everything is okay to do.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 And particularly, I'm practicing the nakwa already in the teaching.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 I can't do anything because already there's nothing to have to give up.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
 Nothing to do, no things.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
 Those are known as s.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
 Then, shorwa, you lost your blue.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000
 You lost your teaching on the back to the habit,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:32.000
 but even we make more obstacles, obscurations to ourselves.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 That is it.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 So, therefore, the kana really keeps on trying to be mindful.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:46.000
 All the way, read the life story of the gracious teacher,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 Buddha Shakyamanda, his teaching, and those great masters.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 Aatishas, or Malarepa, Nunkhiva, and Jangumuha,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.000
 Papurumwajas, all the great kumkra, great kinti.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 Those are our raw examples.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 Even those gracious teachers may be not in our eyesight,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 but their legacy, their monument of teaching, love, and kumkra,

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
 gives women to our eyes, and we can read.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 We can read, really follow those.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:24.000
 How they are humble, simple, thoughtful, respectful, respectful.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
 And even their highest realization, yet their devotion, compassion,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 so strong, strong and grateful, graceful.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 That is what, even, so this is what really,

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 practitioner, zogchen practitioner, very,

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 and practitioner should learn any Jangmi Numba.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
 There is nothing higher, better than the practitioner Nappa

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
 than Jangmi Numba.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 And this lifetime, we also saw, or many of you saw,

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 he's only the new one.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
 He's only the teacher.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000
 How there acts, he's only, he's only thing or teacher.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:11.000
 He's the only, just, just, just, really, so humble, simple.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 Learn to the earth.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 Come in, peaceful, and practicing.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 That's what, that is examples of the practices for all of us.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000
 And then nowadays, so many of those great beings.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
 And for example, he's only Dhala.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
 He is bread, very unpractical.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000
 And yet, he's practicing, meditating, always teaching,

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000
 emphasizing on the completion, both each other,

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 always really emphasizing completion, and humble and simple.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 Many times, even though he is honored by all these people,

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.000
 so many people, devotees of the Buddhist, and even not Buddhist,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000
 devotees are so humble and simple.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 And he's wearing, wearing the shoes.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 Many times, I saw slippers, those slippers that you,

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
 that has one, what's called this?

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.000
 Oh, sandals, sandals, sandals, very simple sandals,

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000
 wearing those, going to the public places.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
 I'm not kidding.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
 Otherwise, we try to dress up nicely, all these things.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
 Oh, it's really wearing those sandals and simple.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 Those, those levels, sandals.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 Sandals, wearing these.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000
 This is really the example of the great time kind of practitioners,

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000
 Vedayana practitioners, Mahayana practitioners of these.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 So, so, so this, and so, then we,

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
 and then I'll go a little bit later on this, on the practice.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000
 Now, today, I think maybe I just go with this,

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000
 continue a little bit, this, that, a little bit,

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 and then I will go later.
