00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.360
 Our Buddha Naturally, Buddha Naturally, that is what we are practicing, that is what we are trying

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:19.380
 to glorify and revere and pour, because the bodhi citta is the key tool to revere this basic, our

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.000
 goodness, and that is all.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.320
 And for example, this ritual ceremony, all the Vayayana practices, all the teaching of the Buddha,

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.440
 the Rasaad of Mantra, all the sartanana teaching, mantra teaching, all the antara teaching,

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:42.940
 whatever we name, all is designed to bring goodness of our soul, this Buddha nature, nature, and

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.000
 help to the other beings to revere that nature. That is all about everything.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.940
 So therefore, this beautiful motivation is always important to this sartanana, that is the one

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:04.120
 where we are standing, that is our platform, that is our soil, ground, where we are standing, and

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.000
 we are our soundtrack.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.740
 So therefore, this motivation of the bodhi citta, and thinking of what we are going to do today,

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:20.000
 all the practices, may that benefit all liberal beings, bring them joy, peace, happiness.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.900
 That means bring forth the life of their nature, nature, product of their hiding places, of the

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.000
 many different departments or the habit patterns, bring forth that.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 When they are eating, everyone really brings forth that beautiful nature.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:47.790
 Then, this trouble is difficult, all are dissipated, all dissolved, a period. Therefore, this is

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.000
 what is necessary and important.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 And that is what the essence of the Buddha teaching.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.100
 And then together with that, in the vedayana teaching, always in said, bring purity, understanding

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.000
 of the nature, purity.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:12.800
 Again, it is not just vedayana or vedayana, like trying to do something extra, but this purity is

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.000
 the nature of ours.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.350
 Again, Buddha teaching all connected, there is nothing really contradictory, all lead to the same

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.000
 direction, it is Buddha nature, to rework that nature.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:35.790
 So, purity, understanding of the nature, means to bring forth that quality, warmly into the state

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.000
 of our body, speech, mind, is action.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 The purity, and that is the purity, understanding.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 And that means purity, realization.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:59.030
 Purity is already here, is what we didn't see because of our habit patterns, all our duality, all

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:06.000
 our ego-cleaning, we didn't find out that.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 And therefore, again, vedayana teaching is known as the powerful teaching.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 Scripum means teaching, not, you can't really like, waiting, put together, resolve.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:26.310
 Instantly, you are in the ordinal resolve, the prutuation status, and that is known as vedayana

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.000
 teaching.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 So, instantly, you are in the state of the purity, which means, then, in the three vedayana stages,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 sambho or that terminology, many of which we all know, used to know, three vedayana teaching.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.200
 So, immediately, in the satharana teaching, it needs to be waited for a long time, gradually

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.000
 developing that, or discovering that realization.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:02.150
 But vedayana, powerfully, skillfully, and instantly, be in that status, and to be in that status,

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.000
 then always in vedayana teaching,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:13.250
 there is a courage, confidence, fearlessness, embracing all the mysteries and the secrets of the v

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.000
edayana, that you can embrace easily,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 and that is the capability of the vedayana practitioners.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:28.180
 For that reason, sometimes, many people may be not exaggerating to all these kind of secrets, not

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.000
 immediately like to jump that stage and be that stage,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 because the habiji pattern, because the ego community.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.410
 Ego is very skeptical, as we all know, like to be hiding on the ego places all the time, and

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.000
 standing on the ego place all the time,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.090
 and then trying to make all many judgmental, suspicious, this and that, and trying to suit the ego

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.000
 itself.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:01.990
 That is the one thing to do, vedayana teaching is very awful, forcefully, immediately, be in that,

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.000
 the purity status,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:11.620
 or to be embarrassing that, then be courageous, be strong, fearlessness, and vedayana to embrace

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:12.000
 this,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 and if we don't have that, for that reason, many times, vedayana teaching, named as mantrayanas.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 Mantrayana, what is called sanma, secret mantrayana.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 Why is it secret? It's not something that it has mistakes, and it has arrows to hide, light to hide

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.000
,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 but because it's not really really proper, who can embrace that, because each and every one's

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 baggage of the ego-claimings,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:56.280
 and as well as habit pattern, and this habit pattern ego-claiming, not just this life, but this

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.000
 being comes,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:04.330
 so many lifetimes, we carried on that, and this time, then also, we added many habit pattern within

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:05.000
 these lives,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 born with habit pattern, and then we added many, we need different tradition, different dramas,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:21.850
 different theoretically, and we added many habit pattern, it's already we have, and then we added

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:22.000
 it,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 and therefore, this many times, vedayana, secret teaching, being known as secret,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 and Buddha did not give example, when 2560 years ago, he didn't give only this vedayana teaching,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 and because at that time, they're not ready with many traditional dramas and systems,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.230
 so vedayana, the vedayana teaching, in the higher realm, in the surgery realm, that's what we've

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:55.000
 heard so many times,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:01.290
 you've heard that, when you read the history of Buddhism or vedayana Buddhism, it's not that Buddha

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:02.000
 needed to expose,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:09.820
 what Buddha did for teaching, I think basically you know, or poor noble truth teaching, poor noble

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:11.000
 truth teaching,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 that is very basic teaching, it's also very general teaching, it suits with the ego,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 it suits with the way we behave, where we are immediately,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 it tells the suffering, and cause of suffering, and how to remove the suffering, and go beyond,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 and how to prepare, then go beyond, the suffer, those are the poor noble truth,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 suffering truth, causes suffering truth, and then sasaya true, and part true,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:53.810
 that is Buddha's first stage teachings, teaching, open a door of the truth, the mystery, the spirit

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:55.000
, true nature,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 that's what Buddha gave, Buddha didn't give immediately the inner dandara, nor outer dandara,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 Buddha didn't give all the like, salam teachings, otsa, channel teachings, long wind teachings,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:18.650
 and those essence brute teachings immediately, even though the intention of the Buddha to lead to

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:19.000
 that direction,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 to that status, but Buddha immediately did not give, it's not that Buddha don't know,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 Buddha not ready to give, it's not that Buddha not ready, but the individualists,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 they are not ready to receive satinos, grade, and mystery, several teachings, therefore,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000
 then, this put to them reason where they are not taking, again, we immediately,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:53.970
 with fellas mostly, then bring the beauty states, all training in the teaching said, bring to

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:55.000
 motivation,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 motivation, the vastness, motivation of the both each other, and again, what means vastness,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:09.060
 vastness means both each other is not restricted to the limited beings, in the areas, locations,

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:10.000
 places,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 beings, the satin beings, as many as space goes, there is no boundary limitation of the space,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 similarly, the satin beings are that many, for that much, for that extent,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:36.060
 for that reason, our both each other goes to all living beings, therefore, it's called

00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:38.000
 unconditional love,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 unconditional compassion, again, tripping in that both each other, have to be courageous,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 and for that reason, as you raise text, again, whether it's saying in our heart or not,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:10:00.150
 but both each other practitioner known as bodhisattvas, bodhisattvas, courageous for them,

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:01.000
 enlightenment.
