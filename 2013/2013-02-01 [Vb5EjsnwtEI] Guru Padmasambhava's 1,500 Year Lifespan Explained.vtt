00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.160
 The teachings and the commentaries suggest that Padmasambhava lived for 1,500 years,

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:17.480
 and I've never been able to get my mind around that. Are there other ways of thinking about what

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.320
 life means?

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:27.040
 Are there alternatives to the birth, living, and death cycle for 1,500 years that we should be

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.480
 aware of,

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.000
 what we're thinking of, to better comprehend that?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.880
 Okay. Okay, I'm trying to get that. I mean, this is true.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:46.080
 Guru Padmasambhava is 1,500 years after he came to Tibet.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:56.390
 So that means that when Buddha entered Mahaprabhu in the Rana and at the years after Buddha's Mahap

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:56.680
rabhu in the Rana,

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:04.790
 or four and a half years after Buddha's Mahaprabhu in the Rana, Guru Padmasambhava appeared,

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.440
 appeared.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:12.280
 And then Buddhism came to Tibet in eight centuries.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:21.880
 So the Buddha was born of Buddha's according Mahaprabhu in the Rana, 500 BC, I think.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:29.000
 About 500 BC is the modern count, what everybody's count of chronology systems.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.560
 So Guru Padmasambha came to Tibet in the mid-eighth century to Tibet.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:44.750
 So therefore, at all that time, Guru Padmasambhava then, as you read in the book, has been as a

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.720
 living Buddha.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:53.880
 The Buddha stayed the same day. And the reason what they said in Guru Padmasambha,

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:02.280
 one of the principal reasons that Guru Padmasambha achieved immortality,

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:13.320
 mortality realizations, his physical elements become, as we're discussing, everything become light.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:21.400
 His body's flesh aspect is light. The earth element of his body is light.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:29.480
 Water element of his body is light. And the wind element of his body is light.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:37.080
 And then as well as such, me. And fire aspect of his element is light.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:45.120
 And then the mind aspect of his mind element is also, of course, wisdom status.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.280
 So all become enlightenment, enlightened status.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:03:03.340
 And therefore, the majority of the five, the roughly five elements are transcendent totally into

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.480
 five wisdom status.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:14.040
 So the Malakri in a way, Malakri, for Guru Padmasambha, Malakri has changed, really changed.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:22.280
 Malakri, right? Malakri and atoms is for him. He changed, shaped.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.120
 So it's all Malakri of the primordial wisdom.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:38.400
 And then he also transcended, already, of course, enlightened beings.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:52.920
 He is born as an Ammitabha, but he also transcended, in this lifetime, all the three emotions,

00:03:52.920 --> 00:04:03.120
 I mean, already he has transcended. Attachment, anger, and ignorance, that completely transcended.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:09.360
 So it's become totally wisdom, wisdom status, wisdom status.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:15.720
 Therefore, his Malakri has changed, his atoms have changed.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:23.360
 He did then, therefore, his physical change, and therefore, he don't have to go the normal,

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:30.080
 normal classically situation of the as we duality beings mostly go, goes.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:37.720
 And that happened to many, many great beings, those who are our power, their own dualities.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:44.240
 They did. As in Buddhism, there are so many stories, and all the different religions,

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:50.200
 they have so many different stories, stories that they changed, really can change.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:55.830
 And the normal consulting level, how they can do that, for example, is renowned stories in

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.440
 Christianity, too.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:09.760
 When the application of Christ is crucified, they say, "Resurgitate, resurrected, resurrected."

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.280
 I mean, you know what I'm talking about.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.840
 I mean, how normal person can do everything.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:30.430
 We have to let Paul, our duality rule, I don't see how he can do that, that must be something

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.040
 different.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:38.800
 There is this, I mean, it's true, there is something, another dimension to discover then the

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.640
 dimension where we are.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:49.400
 These great beings are discovered that, that dimension, and for that reason, as always, I talk.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:56.830
 These great beings can walk in the water. It's true, really said, I never saw that, but I believe,

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.640
 I can, I see the logic here,

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:06.520
 that when you change the molecules and the systems of this, you walk on the water, or you walk in

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.880
 the air.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:19.040
 And as I said the other day, they made food friends, hand friends, body friends, on solid rock.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.840
 And how? We see that, I saw, thyself, really I saw.

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:35.240
 If you go into bed, you will see many of those, those, but how they can do, how they did.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:39.920
 That means there is something, there is another window to do something.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:45.320
 This is all indicating, this is what it's not, it's just, this is.

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:54.200
 There is something more to discover, to the day, truly that is what it is.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:59.160
 And then there is so many other stories, beautiful things, I mean, one after another, they talk,

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.240
 this truly does all this.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:10.330
 So therefore, even, it's like, for example, in a teaching, I'm going to say, said, after 1,500, I

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:12.240
 came to Tibet, he said.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:20.240
 I will stay in Tibet 112 years, then I will leave.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:30.100
 See, of course, one way, as we are talking, is very, very kind of unbelievable. It's kind of very

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:31.240
 difficult belief.

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:36.240
 But there is definitely something to more discover.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:45.750
 There is something behind our duality frames, our vegan frame, our knowledge frame, and our

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:47.240
 capability frame.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:58.240
 These two beings, that discover, that penetrate the holes, and we see some of those, those, truly.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:20.240
 So therefore, so that's what I really can tell.

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:29.230
 In 112, he stays in Tibet, but that generated all, that count as, let's say, one year as two years,

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:30.240
 and that's what the teaching said.

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:34.240
 So, because in ancient times, India, or even now, they do, too.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:40.510
 Each, like, according to the lunar circle, the full moon, from day one to the full moon, is one

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:41.240
 month.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:50.240
 So the waxing and the waning, that's like two months. So our 12-month, 30-day, they make that as,

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:55.240
 because lunar circle, circle as 24 per month.

00:08:55.240 --> 00:09:00.240
 So therefore, so is count as one year, as two years. Yes?

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:05.240
 May I just say that that's the best and clearest analysis I have ever heard.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:11.240
 Also kinds. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
