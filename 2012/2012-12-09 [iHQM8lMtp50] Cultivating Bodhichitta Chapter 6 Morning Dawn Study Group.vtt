00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720
 Welcome! This is the 6th webcast of the PBC Morning Dawn Study Group from Padma Samye Ling, and

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.010
 today we'll be talking about Chapter 6 of the Venerable Khenpo Rinpoches book "The Buddhist Path",

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.000
 and the chapter is entitled "Cultivating Bodhichitta".

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 So first we'll begin with opening prayers, and then we'll continue the discussion.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 [Singing]

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 [Singing]

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 [Singing]

00:01:42.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 [Singing]

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 [Singing]

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.310
 So today we have three topics we're going to discuss in this chapter "Cultivating Bodhichitta", and

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:31.850
 then the first here, basically I'll just summarize the first section of this chapter really quickly

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:32.000
.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.170
 The Veneroble Khenpo Rinpoches first say that achieving enlightenment totally depends on one's own

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.000
 effort, and that the best way to become enlightened is with bodhichitta.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.310
 And this bodhichitta has two aspects, this relative aspect of feeling and expressing love and

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:54.900
 compassion for all beings, and then the absolute aspect of realizing the empty nature of all

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.000
 phenomena, oneself and all others.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 So the first point summarized in a paragraph on page 33, which is the second paragraph.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.690
 The root of bodhichitta is compassion. Compassion is feeling deep in your heart the suffering of

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.000
 others, and wishing for them to be free from all pain.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.360
 The root of compassion is loving kindness, which is the feeling of wanting to replace suffering

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.000
 with happiness and peace.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 Having true love and compassion for everyone is the most precious practice of the Dharma.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 Without this, your practice will remain superficial and never be deeply rooted in the true Dharma.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:49.840
 I have a question. So here they say having true love and compassion for everyone is the most

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:56.000
 precious practice, and without this, your practice will never be rooted in the true Dharma.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.050
 So that's a tall order, right from the beginning, because you have to have love and compassion for

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:03.000
 everyone.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.210
 And if we're sentient beings, the definition of sentient beings is they don't have love and

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:10.000
 compassion for everyone.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.500
 You know, I mean, they're self-centered. You know, we have the five poisons, if you're an ordinary

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.000
 being.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 So how do we even start to begin to cultivate loving kindness and compassion for everyone?

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 That's not where many of us, such as myself, don't naturally just start out there. Any thoughts?

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.960
 It seems the first thing is that that's kind of like the view to start with at least. And why is

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:49.090
 that? Because, I mean, that's how the natural state is, or how the enlightened mind is in that way,

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:50.000
 it seems.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:57.020
 And just kind of an underlying thing. You can have this aspiration, but it's kind of a view that's

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:05.000
 showing to start out from, like, what is the source and the goal and all of that with the practice.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.780
 And there's more to be said, but it just seems like that's a general frame. I mean, that comes to

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.000
 mind first. I'm sure other people have what it comes to.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 And of course, there's people we can relate to who we do love and who we do see suffer.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:38.040
 And it seems like that can be, I don't know, it's like a doorway to all beings. We can think of one

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:45.000
 being who we love and don't want to suffer and want to be free of suffering.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:52.380
 And can, like, kind of have that be like a gateway to engaging with our authentic feeling and

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:57.000
 thinking about how we wish that for everyone.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.780
 And think about how who knows all the ways in which we're related to that one person and how,

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:12.550
 really, according to the Buddhist teachings, everyone we've had close relationships with in the

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:13.000
 past.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:20.670
 But just in that way, beginning to think about real beings who are in our life and in our world who

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:28.600
 we can relate to and just remembering there's more, you know, and keeping our aspiration open and

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.000
 engaging with that to the best of our abilities.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:39.070
 I think another way, too, is really contemplating the, kind of, just the enlightened qualities of

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:45.000
 the Buddhists and, like, seeing, like, thinking about that they can do this.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:52.100
 And, you know, like our teachers tell us in this chapter about how, you know, our bodhicitta at

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:59.230
 this time may be small, but it is within our potential to develop this total vast limitless bodhic

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:03.000
itta, boundless bodhicitta, that it is possible.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:09.070
 And we trust that, we trust what our teachers say, we contemplate what these enlightened beings, we

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:15.740
 read about their lives and that they've done this and inspire us and, kind of, sort of, that trust

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:17.000
 that we can do it.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.750
 And then, like you were saying, like, developing that aspiration and wish that we're really strong,

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:29.000
 getting stronger, and it seems maybe at that point, maybe they'll lead into this next discussion

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 about the absolute bodhicitta where we

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:38.940
 start understanding that, oh, maybe it's not so limited, you know, there is more space available,

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:43.000
 there is more, more possible than I currently think.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 And that, kind of, can be our bridge to bringing relative and absolute bodhicitta, too, together.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.010
 I think, going off of what you're saying, too, I remember one of the first books I read in Buddhism

00:07:55.010 --> 00:08:00.580
 was one of the Dalai Lama's books. I think it was called "How to Expand Bodhicitta," but a lot of

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:05.000
 the way he wrote the book was tinkering with your view.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.930
 He'd give these, kind of, hypotheticals or meditation on, think of someone who you're close to and

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:16.470
 then think about, essentially exactly what Lai was saying, thinking about all those shared

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:20.000
 qualities, and now expand that out to someone who you feel more neutral towards.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:27.110
 Okay, now that you've practiced that, expand that out to someone who it's not very easy for you to

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:34.180
 feel loving towards. You know, you're expanding, expanding, and particularly the way that he goes

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.000
 about it.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.300
 And I think the same, I see a lot of the same thing with all of the great teachers is you start

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:46.440
 tinkering with the view, which goes a lot into what I think Amanda also said, you know, you tinker

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:49.000
 with the view, and when you're tinkering with the view,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:55.690
 you start to realize that the narrow view that you were holding isn't some absolute thing, it isn't

00:08:55.690 --> 00:09:04.000
 some permanent thing. It gives that little bit of a gap. That gap is where so much potential is.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:11.900
 I think, although this only applies to people who have met a great teacher, I find that just

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:20.330
 thinking of how you feel around the teacher, what the teacher gives all, it's like, okay, that must

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:21.000
 be it.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:28.340
 So it's kind of like right there for you, it's kind of like thinking of a parent being that's

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:35.000
 saying, well, I think it's great, but it's hard if you don't have a teacher.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.530
 I don't think even before what I was saying, think about those people who are compassionate in your

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:40.000
 life.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.490
 You know, even, I mean, of course, you know, someone who's just nice to you on the street maybe won

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:53.000
't give you the same burst of compassion that, you know, going and seeing Kenpo, but it's a start.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.060
 And I think, too, the real basis of the question is so we're all, I mean, sentient beings

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:05.000
 experiencing kind of the own difficulties that are kind of always kind of coming back at us.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.710
 And I think that really is the springboard, like in that chapter on taking refuge that we went over

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:14.130
, I mean, Amanda said, part of it is we have to recognize these enlightened qualities of the great

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:16.000
 masters that are really out of samsara.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 They're no longer producing the negative emotions and the grasping that causes all these troubles.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.150
 And at the same time, the other side of that is to see, well, what is the cause of these troubles

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:28.000
 of samsara?

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.420
 And it is our own grasping mind and own kind of negative emotions and more limited, narrow ways of

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:37.000
 functioning our minds, tightening our heart, closing.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 And then we see that in our own experience.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
 And we see that, okay, I do, there is some difficulty here.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 How do I get out?

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 So that's the first two noble truths.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 And like, so we have compassion for ourselves.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 There is a problem here.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
 And it's a genuine problem when we really start to see, this isn't permanent.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000
 I keep doing these things.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
 They keep causing me trouble.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 I don't want to do them as much, but I keep doing them.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 And then we need to have compassion.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
 Okay, is there a way out?

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:11.060
 So then there's a little more air in the room, a little more searching for what might help me come

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:12.000
 out of this.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 And then at the same time, we can identify other people.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 Oh, that person is hurting too.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 Oh, that person is going through this other thing I went through already.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
 And then we kind of enlarging this fear like Lodra is saying.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:29.000
 And then keeping in mind this greater view of these great beings that have freely, fully activated

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000
 and even in some cases completely realized the beautiful nature of their mind and their heart.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 And then we see living examples of these great masters and can directly experience that.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 And it uplifts us.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:49.000
 It shows us a way of how compassion is so strong and so capable and so flexible and so grounded

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000
 and so functional and so just really so desirable.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 It's the most desirable thing in samsara in our desire realm of constantly clean

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 to try to move towards this love and compassion for ourselves and for others.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:11.690
 But I think the basis is seeing how we don't have that at the same time staying with that larger

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:12.000
 view.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 But there are these teachings on how my nature is totally pure and so is yours.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 And this situation is very workable.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 So there's a basis to grow from.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 It's kind of just a simple thing about just the word bodhicitta.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 You know how it's defined here on these concepts and terms.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 But basically the mind of enlightenment.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:40.690
 So I mean just within the word is that the mind has to be, it's the mind being turned to it towards

00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:41.000
 enlightenment.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:47.000
 So we have to have at first this sense of what is enlightenment, what's so great about it.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
 So contemplating that first.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 So we have like a destination that we understand what we're doing.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 And then within that, with is bodhicitta also.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 Many, many times Vibhiches define it as the combination of love, compassion and wisdom.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 So like in this paragraph we're talking about love and compassion and wisdom.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 Like all three really are essential.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
 So just thinking about the definition of the word is basically what I'm saying.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 Just like have that in mind.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:28.000
 That wisdom is an essential component and the wisdom is what takes it to an enlightened perspective

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:28.000
.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 Because with love and compassion which is so wonderful and so essential too,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
 then that's what the point of we're benefiting.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 Without the wisdom it stays, it's not a liberative pattern.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
 This kind of like what makes everything boundless and transcendent.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 Big.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:56.000
 That whole boundless quality of like in his commentary on the words of my perfect teacher,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:05.000
 Vibhavacham has this beautiful section on like how bodhicitta begins to increase.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
 And he says the essence of bodhicitta is the four boundless.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
 But boundless means includes all sentient beings.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
 That's the trick.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 So he says the four boundless love, compassion, sympathetic joy and then impartiality or equanimity

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:23.000
.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 He says even though they have love in the first list as the first one,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000
 in the pith instructions when you should start with impartiality,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.750
 you should start with basically just like what you guys were saying too and like what Drachma was

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:38.000
 saying.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
 All beings want to be happy.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000
 We're all the same, we have that common, whatever else we don't have in common,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 we do all have in common that we want to be happy.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 And then like what Lai was saying,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000
 reflecting on the fact that you've been in all these different kinds of relationships with,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.600
 of course this is Buddhism, we're talking about what the Buddha taught which he taught reincarn

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:03.000
ation,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:08.000
 he taught we've been in these relationships with each other forever.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
 Like we've been enemies, we've been friends, we've been all that to each other

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 and the common thread is we all want to be happy but we're not.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.000
 So recognizing that all the troubles that we are going through, just like you are,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000
 this other person who's your enemy is also going through those troubles.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:32.000
 Even though we tend to think, oh yay, my enemy is going through that trouble, yes.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:38.000
 That's usually the usual reaction but I think something about that,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:44.000
 being able to take that perspective and being able to recognize that humanity

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:52.000
 is just like the total foundation building block of equalizing, you know,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.000
 has seen that view.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 Yeah, it goes into the second topic point.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:06.000
 So I'll do a quick summary of this second section of the chapter really quickly.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:12.000
 Venerable Kembor Rinpoche said that it's only with bodhichitta that we can realize enlightenment.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
 And without bodhichitta we cannot realize enlightenment.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000
 That bodhichitta is working to free all beings from suffering

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 and establishing them in enlightenment without any concern for your own welfare.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:32.000
 The root of bodhichitta is compassion and the root of compassion is loving kindness.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 And then your love and compassion should include all beings

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
 and of course now these qualities are limited

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 but with training over time they can become infinite.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 And that everything becomes easier as we become more familiar with it

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
 and that bodhichitta is no exception to this, it works in the same way.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 As we train in it more and more it becomes easier and easier to recognize and generate.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:02.000
 And then seeing that all beings are equal, we all want happiness and none of us want to suffer.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:09.000
 And then they talk about how the relative aspect of bodhichitta has two subdivisions or two parts.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:15.000
 On the one hand is the wishing or the aspiring relative bodhichitta wanting to help others.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:22.000
 And then there's the actualizing or engaging bodhichitta where we actually work to help others.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
 We put that aspiration into practice, we perform it.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:32.000
 So then the second topic question or point is...

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 When you develop the thought of enlightenment you are training your mind

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
 so that you will be able to truly benefit other beings.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 Bodhichitta can be understood in two ways as relative and absolute.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:53.000
 Relative bodhichitta is the actual manifestation of loving kindness and compassion for all beings.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:59.000
 Absolute bodhichitta is the realization of emptiness as the profound true nature of reality.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:05.000
 Some people start meditating on love and compassion and then come to an understanding of emptiness.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 Other people meditate on emptiness and by that gain an understanding of love and compassion.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:17.000
 Both aspects of bodhichitta are part of the enlightened nature of the mind.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:23.690
 I had a question actually just about that point about how they say that meditating on love and

00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:26.000
 compassion leads to emptiness and vice versa.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:34.000
 Emptiness leads to love and compassion. Just thought what you all thought about that.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
 Doesn't that have a great little nugget?

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.000
 I love that.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.000
 I think it's true. I mean you talk to different people. Practitioners does seem that people have

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 sort of like an entry way

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:51.000
 where they're kind of more working with one aspect and then leading to the other

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 and just wondering if you all put you all out of that point.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:00.000
 In the end of the path we have total balance between two truths.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 Relative truth and absolute truth. At that point we'd be a Buddha.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 So then all along for all of us in the past, some of us like the relative side a little more,

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:15.000
 the forms and expressions, the ways of moving, the things we can kind of engage with

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.620
 and then others of us like the absolute parts, the open things, the space through which things

00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:23.000
 happen, the limitlessness of it all.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:30.000
 And so there's constantly events for all of us on the path between that being flexible and

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.000
 expressing

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 in the structure and the openness of the structure.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 So I think that's just more like saying a statement.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.730
 That is the path, like finding that balance and trying to approach it in a playful, more of a dance

00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:44.000
 way

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:49.620
 and to not get locked into either side, only structure, structure, structure, or only open, open,

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:50.000
 open.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000
 But really clearly saying that bodhicitta, our own nature, always has these two aspects.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.640
 And when they're totally seen to be in perfect harmony, like how the nature is, without being ob

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:02.000
structed by grasping man,

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.000
 then we're Buddha, we're free of any extreme, one side or the other.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 So then just to reiterate that point, it's very curious.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 I had a question. It says the root of bodhicitta is compassion.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:22.840
 The front of us says compassion should be more like a dance than a hug. It should be intelligent

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:24.000
 compassion.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.000
 It shouldn't just be like blindly going into some project because it seems good at the time.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:40.690
 Is that to get intelligent compassion, you just need to cultivate the relative side of compassion

00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:41.000
 first

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 and then the wishing, which is just cultivating this love for all beings,

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000
 like we're talking about with the parent being or with your teacher.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:21:01.000
 So do you need that relative wishing before you go into actualizing bodhicitta?

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.730
 It seems like you'd want to have, you'd want to want to do something in order to then begin to do

00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:07.000
 it.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:15.000
 More like a meditation side, like you're in meditation and you're really bringing up these thoughts

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000
 with compassion and love.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:24.780
 But is it like you need to cultivate that to a level so that it's foundational before you go out

00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:27.000
 and actualize it?

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:36.000
 I, unfortunately, I don't know specifically the context that Pungco Rinpoche is talking in part,

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000
 but just a thought that kind of sparked up with it.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:51.010
 I mean, you don't need to, you don't need to put something rigid or something foundational in place

00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:52.000
 to have compassion.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:58.000
 Compassion is very natural. Why is compassion? That's a little different.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000
 I think that's a bit of what he's talking about, the hug versus the dance.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.270
 Because if you just kind of throw yourself out there and say, "I'm going to do all this good for

00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:09.000
 all these people,"

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:14.000
 but you don't know what's actually going to create that level of benefit

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:23.000
 and you don't have the stability of a balanced mind to actually be able to follow through.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:29.000
 There you can start problems or make things worse than they were before.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:36.000
 But at that same time, it's not that compassion won't happen if you don't have those things.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 It's not the wise compassion.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 Maybe it could get too restrained. You're about to do something compassionate,

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:51.000
 and then you're like, "Is that wise compassion?"

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000
 In some cases that's smart, because think of first aid training.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000
 You're not going to go running into a scene where someone just got hit

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000
 because you have to check to see, "Is there a wire there? Why is the person on the floor?"

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000
 That's a good requirement.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.000
 So on that level, yes, it's good to have that safe level of compassion,

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.000
 but at the same time, you don't want to over-ridgify yourself

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000
 where you're just going to sit there and let the person stay there in the road

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.000
 because there might be a wire somewhere.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:25.000
 It seems like, too, there's this element of particulars versus generals.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:34.000
 The abstract sense of compassion arising in your own minds

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:39.000
 in terms of all sentient beings, or this group of people, or that group of people,

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.000
 but then when it comes to specific circumstances in a way,

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:50.000
 that has to be based on, to some extent, understanding.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:55.000
 The common vernacular term, "idiot compassion," is what I would use it.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:03.000
 I think that means, I don't know, I guess an example,

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.000
 doing something that seems like a good idea at the time.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:12.000
 He is giving a hungry person bread and then being dependent on him

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 so that they actually just are worse off.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000
 He's pointing to something really specific,

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000
 but it just seems like that basic understanding.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:28.000
 There's an example of the Buddha as one of his first disciples was a young girl.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:34.000
 I think the same Sujata who gave her milk.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:39.000
 Her little brother, he was really sick and she got so frustrated.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.000
 He wasn't sick, but he was fussing. He was a baby, really fussy.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:49.000
 She got more and more irritated than she realized that he was sick

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000
 and he had this physical problem, maybe something stabbing him.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.000
 Then once she understood, of course she had compassion beforehand,

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000
 but it was kind of a vague thing,

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.000
 but once she had that understanding of the particular circumstance,

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000
 that's more like wisdom in the land.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.000
 Then she really knew exactly how to manifest that compassion.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000
 One example, I guess.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.000
 I don't know. Why not just mention we have maybe five minutes

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000
 until we're at 30 minutes?

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000
 It seemed like part of what you're talking about, Amen,

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:29.000
 that balance between aspiring and actualizing.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:34.000
 But it seems like we always, like Rinpoche, say again and again,

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000
 we need to always act in accordance to our capabilities,

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000
 which is what we're all talking about.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:45.000
 Because we'll never learn to dance if we never try to dance.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000
 We're always going to learn, so I think that's the part.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.000
 And then, I don't know, of course in here it goes over the four boundless

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:59.000
 and then the six haparamitas, those are very traditional ways of framing that,

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000
 you know, the aspirational bodhicitta

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:08.000
 and the practices that actually actualize it, you know.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000
 But I don't know.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.000
 Just a related point too, I just thought to mention, I remember it struck me,

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:21.000
 I heard once that a Salinas karmapa said like our compassion shouldn't be,

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.000
 should be careful that our compassion doesn't become pity.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:31.000
 And I just, I don't know why, just that it's not like, oh, it's poor

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000
 and like I have these, almost like there's a superiority

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000
 to this inferior being who's suffering, like just to be careful of that

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 and just to like kind of check where we're coming from.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.000
 Anyway, it's just as a thing.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.000
 In the main way, I mean definitely a Salinas Dalai Lama has mentioned the exact same thing,

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:54.000
 I think many places, that the way to prevent compassion from becoming pity

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:59.000
 is by we're working directly more with a Buddha nature of the other being

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.000
 and then our own goodness Buddha nature too.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.000
 And we start with that as the basis and with this person is 100%

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:12.000
 fundamentally essentially wonderful being, really becoming a Buddha

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.000
 and that we're really more connected with that in the process of as we help them

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000
 or as we kind of keep that sense in mind.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:25.000
 And it really does touch more to like the boundlessness of that emotion

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000
 or that quality arising in us.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.000
 It's our own Buddha nature connecting with their Buddha nature.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:35.000
 And the same with love, like we don't try to hug someone and say, oh, I like you,

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000
 I love you because you do everything the way I want it.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000
 Like, just like, oh, I don't have compassion for you because you're so pitiful.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:48.000
 Same way, I don't love you just because you always say yes and suit the way I want it.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:53.000
 Like it's the same way, the wisdom part is to try to do this without the grasping,

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:58.000
 without the attachment, more and more flexible and it is really connected towards the view.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000
 It's why like all these practices lead to the view.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000
 Like the six paramitas, like the actualizing bodhicitta,

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.000
 they lead up to a full transcendent wisdom.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000
 Or like study the three trainings.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:19.000
 We study, then we receive, then we process, then we directly perceive.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000
 And that's the view.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.000
 And so we're always trying to lead into that more open, direct experience.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.000
 And then like they said in the second topic point,

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.000
 being in that open, direct experience is the nature.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 And that nature has natural qualities of love and compassion arising from it.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:42.000
 That if our experience of our nature is flat, dry, restricted, agitated,

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.000
 anxious, nervous, it's not the nature.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000
 It's us zoning out or closing in some way.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:52.000
 It should not, it should be juicy and like a kind of little tender and have like a wound.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.000
 True Vermice also says they're kind of like a wound.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.000
 You're sensitive to the world.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000
 It almost has this bittersweet quality.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 We love these beings, so beautiful beings.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000
 And then we're constantly just totally preventing our happiness.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000
 And it's sad.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.000
 Like it is this samsara that's totally preventable.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000
 It could be totally free in our being with our nature.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000
 At the same time, we're choosing to not be that way every minute almost.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000
 It's really this bittersweet tension.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000
 It goes into the third point.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:28.000
 Oh, so the third point is, vermice say at the end of the chapter,

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.000
 the more we practice bodhicitta and cultivate this motivation,

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:37.000
 we perform bodhisattva activities and meditate on absolute bodhicitta,

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:42.000
 the nature of our mind, and also dedicate our merit for all beings,

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000
 then the more we'll feel that others are more important than ourselves.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.000
 And we'll work more diligently and joyfully to help them.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000
 And that the Buddha repeatedly prays the qualities of love and compassion

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000
 again and again throughout his teachings.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.000
 He said one instant of bodhicitta brings enormous benefit,

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.000
 and then developing bodhicitta as a way of life

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000
 leads directly to enlightenment of ourselves and all beings.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.000
 So then that third topic point, Ayman, would you read that?

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.000
 Sure.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.000
 Thanks.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000
 To practice bodhicitta, you need to dedicate your efforts freely and openly

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.000
 without expecting anything in return.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 The more you meditate and practice bodhicitta,

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000
 the more you feel that others are as dear as yourself,

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.000
 and eventually their welfare becomes even more important than your own.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:33.000
 It's page 35, first full paragraph.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.000
 It's really beautiful.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:41.000
 It goes on to what you were saying, and then on to this point,

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:48.000
 that whole Buddha nature aspect of everyone's not just ignorant sentient beings.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000
 That's just a label.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.000
 From one perspective, everyone is a potential Buddha,

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000
 who has all these qualities that they themselves don't see.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000
 But anyway, I just thought something related to that point.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.000
 That's why I think people respond so powerfully sometimes

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.000
 to these teachers, these wisdom beings,

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:13.000
 because maybe they're not used to being treated with so much respect.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:21.000
 Maybe they don't see themselves as something worthy of any kind of respect.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.000
 But then you get around these teachers,

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:30.000
 and they see what you see, your image,

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.000
 but they also see, it's like they talk right to you,

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000
 your deep meaning, and it helps you bring that up,

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.000
 and it helps that shine.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000
 Creating those natural conditions.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000
 This seems like our Buddha nature.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.000
 It's an inherent nature of ourselves and all beings.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:57.000
 And just that aspect of that beautiful view of how it's completely empty

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.000
 of any substantially existing inherent.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.000
 Something we can find is that open, empty nature.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:14.000
 But then, inseparable from that is nothing but 100% arising compassion and wisdom.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:19.000
 Just as that view and integrating that into that.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.000
 And then just how everyone thrives.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:30.000
 Even if someone is given an ounce of respect or a chance to be heard,

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:36.000
 we really kind of bring out those natural qualities and goodness qualities and beings.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000
 I mean, of course it's multiferous.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:48.000
 I thought too we had maybe about five minutes to kind of wrap things up.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:53.000
 So maybe just as we talk, if we kind of bring it all together.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 I have one question. We do next time on Bodhicitta too.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000
 Anyway, we don't have to answer it.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.000
 It's like such a foundational, important topic that it's just like...

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.000
 You're saying how many definitions does it have in this topic?

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.000
 Yeah, what's that?

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000
 Kuntzang called it and he said there's like 22 different ways

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:19.000
 that the Prabhupāramīta says Bodhicitta is 22 or 24 different things.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:25.000
 Other people say 80 and so it's very nice.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:29.000
 And it's beautiful we have these teachings that are distilled in such essential points

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.000
 so that we can really practice them and also really get at the heart of them.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.000
 These great masters have passed along these lineage instructions

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000
 and realized them in their own personal experience.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:44.000
 I mean, at the same time, there's so many nuances just like life,

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000
 just like all this interdependent phenomenon.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:54.000
 There's so much unique tendrils or like these little webs of interconnected nuance

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:59.000
 that they're so rich to really lean into and become more familiar with

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000
 and really appreciate more, be more thorough, be more complete.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.000
 And within that larger view, there's so much nuance.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.000
 And at the same time, we have these treasure instructions

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.000
 of how to really distill the essence

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:18.000
 and then we can spread into the detail and really like fill out like our experience

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000
 and really become more, you know, less idiot, compassion,

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:27.000
 and more really full bodied, like full loving wisdom beings.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:33.000
 I mean, to really have a view and really fill it in.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.000
 That sentence we were talking about before is so beautiful.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.000
 Again, you know how some people start meditating on the love of compassion

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000
 and come into the understanding.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000
 And some people meditate on that understanding of emptiness

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000
 and move into the love of compassion.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000
 You know, coming back to what you were saying, you know,

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.000
 you can find that essence and then you can see the detail

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:57.000
 and you can just see how the whole thing is still encompassed within that enlightened mind.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.000
 I think even another way of saying it, which is just there's so many ways of saying it

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.000
 because, you know, we talk relative absolute.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:09.000
 You can say it in terms of like devotion and compassion in a sense too,

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.000
 thinking like, you know, contemplating, like we were talking about earlier,

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.000
 contemplating the qualities of enlightenment is basically like devotion in a way.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.000
 You know, thinking about, oh, you know, my teacher has all these incredible qualities

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.000
 and I like aspire to be like that or to develop those qualities.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000
 And that's the devotion opening, you know, kind of the getting,

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.000
 touching onto that absolute aspect.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:34.000
 And then likewise, though, I mean, so that's one gateway,

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000
 one entry way to begin.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:41.000
 And, you know, another way to begin would be to just feel love and compassion

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.000
 and develop that and thinking, you know, more about sentient beings

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.000
 and like those who wish to be happy, all beings wish to be happy and contemplate.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:54.000
 And they both, you can see in that way, they lead one, they lead to each other, really.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.000
 It's kind of just really beautiful like that.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.000
 I thought the one really important point, which we all know is like,

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.000
 we've heard so many times from Rinpoche's and everybody,

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000
 like his woman, this dude, Rinpoche, he said,

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000
 "There's not, you shouldn't do even a single mani.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:17.000
 If you do even a single mani recitation or any kind of practice at all,

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:23.000
 refuge, bodhicitta, and then dedicate the merit from that."

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000
 He said, "Even the most smallest practice."

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:29.000
 So just to bring it like, how bodhicitta, this is Mahayana, you know,

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.000
 this is Vajrayana, it's the total root, it's the complete foundation.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:37.000
 And if we can maintain that motivation and intention

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:41.000
 and try to follow through with our practice that way, we won't,

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000
 we'll never get off the path.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:48.000
 So I think it's just nice to just remember that refuge in the beginning

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:53.000
 with that motivation of bodhicitta, and as Holiness, he even said that,

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:58.000
 even a single mani, all mani from the home, you should dedicate that merit

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.000
 and you should do it for the intention of bodhicitta for all beings.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000
 It's very beautiful.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.000
 Also in that main practice, with this large, more expansive view

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:14.000
 of the flexible, illusory, playful nature, like always that is there too.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:19.000
 The dedication is open, the refuge of bodhicitta dreamlike,

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.000
 and so it's always within this absolute bodhicitta as well.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.000
 So that's really, it's so special, thank you.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:30.000
 Yeah, they say that's in this definition, just that absolute bodhicitta recognizes

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000
 that all beings are primordially enlightened.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.000
 There is no liberator, no deluded beings, and no act of liberation,

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.000
 since nothing ever moves from the absolute sphere of the Dharma Dantu.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.000
 So just like what you're saying, keeping that in mind.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:49.000
 So to recognize that nature is the great absolute bodhicitta.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.000
 It's really amazing.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:59.000
 And then Kaverpoche says really very simple style, think globally, act locally.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:09.000
 Big view, detailed, loving, simple steps, compassion.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000
 To be continued.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000
 Always.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.000
 [Singing]

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.000
 [Singing continues]

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:41.000
 [Singing continues]

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.000
 By this merit, may all obtain omniscience.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.000
 May it defeat the enemy wrongdoing.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.000
 From the stormy waves of earth, old age, sickness and death.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.000
 From the ocean of samsara, may I free all beings.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.000
 The precious bodhicitta, and those without it, may it be generated.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:03.000
 And those who have it, may it never diminish, but always continue increasing.
