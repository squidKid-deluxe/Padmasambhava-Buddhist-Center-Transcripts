00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.200
 Welcome, warm greetings, friends. Warm greetings. So we begin by connecting to and reactivating,

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:21.160
 re-recognizing our motivation of bodhichitta, the love and compassion we have for ourselves

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:27.080
 and all sentient beings, to really kind of firmly let that kind of blossom in our own

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:34.120
 mind right now, open our heart, open our mind, and connect to this stainless lineage wisdom

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:41.080
 of the Buddha's teachings. And be so thankful for that and really see that precious opportunity

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.760
 that we have together for this brief little time to reflect on the teachings of the Buddha

00:00:45.760 --> 00:01:01.360
 for the benefit of all beings.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:26.960
 Thank you. So the topic today that we have just a little window of time to share together

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:34.880
 is talking about how Ngondro practice, our foundational practices, relate to the bardos.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:41.160
 So basically how we're using this Ngondro practice as somewhat of a rehearsal for going

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:47.640
 through the bardos. And so that's kind of the topic and it's such a big extraordinarily

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:56.000
 important topic. So we're just having a tiny little glimpse into a very extensive set of

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 teachings taught by the Buddha and Gurumbhache that have been maintained up until this present

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.840
 moment. And so this is just like a little hint of these bardo teachings which are so

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.080
 profound and powerful and that so many masters have given extensive commentaries on what

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:20.800
 comes down to how to use this moment well. How we can really use this opportunity well,

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:31.240
 this life well to make every moment meaningful and to really kind of define a charter course

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:40.240
 into our future that's going to just be going from light to light, brighter and brighter.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:48.120
 And so this topic, I mean the first thing to really consider is really just a true fact

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:57.280
 that we're all going to die. And so many of the teachings of the Buddha are kind of trying

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:05.680
 to reorient our kind of like our tight kind of a little bit like scared way that we're

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:11.060
 constantly engaging with experience. Always trying to avoid the things that don't feel

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.960
 so comfortable and trying to get and hold onto the things that support us and make us

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:22.880
 happy and the pleasurable things. So the teaching and just kind of that true insight, it's not

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:31.120
 a Buddhist insight but just we're born so we're going to die. It's just a fundamental

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:37.800
 truth of life and for the ego to hear that, my go at grasping and fixation, you know I

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.400
 might intellectually kind of say oh I got that, you know resonate, oh of course I'm

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:50.360
 going to die. But to really keep coming back to that thought, that contemplation and as

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:57.320
 a practice like this time is limited. There's no certainty over this next moment. There

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:08.200
 just really is no certainty. I know that sometime I will die and that I don't know when. And

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.560
 so the ego in one sense the Buddha taught in his mind only school teachings that all

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:21.920
 sentient beings share this same conviction that I am here, me. And I'm this basically

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:27.520
 I'm the center of the universe. And I'm the same me that I was a minute ago and yesterday

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:36.560
 and the year before. And this me just continues ongoing. That if we're a sentient being with

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:43.000
 a sentient mind then we have this belief. Whether we consciously know it or we would

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.480
 say we do, the Buddha taught that all of us have that. There's a me that's more special

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:58.040
 than anything else that was, that's continuing through time uninterruptedly that we have

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:04.800
 this core belief. So when this me hears something like I'm going to die, it does anything it

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.960
 can to avoid it because it's fundamentally like I really don't believe that. So I'll

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:16.900
 even act like oh I kind of understand that and not really let it hit my egoic fixation.

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:22.320
 Not really let it kind of like put my decisions into question and to savor the moments of

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:31.360
 experience. We have that expression killing time. I mean so much of my time spent distracted.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:37.920
 It's kind of wasting opportunities, just precious moments to reconnect with bodhicitta and goodness

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:44.360
 of other beings. That's what a sentient being is called wandering. Kind of wandering after

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:51.160
 this, wandering after that, drowa to wonder, wanderers. We kind of wonder from one distraction

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:59.280
 to the next. So kind the Buddha gave us these little shocks to our egoic fixation like everything

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:08.520
 born is going to die. This is the second mind turning. And he said again and again we're

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:14.300
 trying to reintroduce this into our own mind stream to let our ego instead of pushing against

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:19.160
 it so strongly just to consider it a little more deeply each time. So we always begin our

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:25.840
 nundra practice with these four mind turnings. Preciousness of this opportunity, its fleeting

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:34.240
 impermanent nature. That everything we do is always a part of this vast network of cause

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:42.440
 and effect of interdependence. And that really having our tight fixation, our grasping onto

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:51.480
 this me really causes a lot of dissatisfaction, discomfort, dis-ease, stress. Feels like I'm

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:58.600
 always banging up against the world and not getting what I want. The suffering, the samsara.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:04.320
 And so I wonder and more or less kind of bang around against experience. And these four

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:10.600
 mind turnings are just always a part of every nundra. And like Rinpoche's, the Venerable

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:15.360
 Kempo Rinpoche says it should be the foundation of every single practice we do. Buddhist

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.160
 terminology

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:22.280
 is called renunciation. And Venerable Kempo sendone Rinpoche often really emphasizes it

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:28.200
 on the more positive encouraging side as joy and appreciation. And that's what contemplating

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:38.080
 this fact, this true fact. This life is limited. I don't know when my life will end. And none

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:45.140
 of us do. And so I really have to use this opportunity and really savor the moments.

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:50.860
 Maybe this is the last time we'll communicate. Maybe that was the last sunrise that I saw

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:57.280
 this morning. It could be the last thing that, you know, last thing you hear. The last time

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:01.160
 you get to see someone and actually the final words. We never know when our final words

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:08.400
 are. So if we really take this to heart, it actually causes us to really like fully engage

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:20.100
 in life, to savor life instead of being some kind of dreary news. It's like this buoyant

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:29.780
 fueled urgency to like really use the moments well and let bodhicitta shine. And so this

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:36.480
 comes to the fundamental amazing insight that the Buddha taught and that just about how

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:46.400
 the nature is that when it comes to the moment of dying for every single sentient being that

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:56.200
 at the moment of death, our true nature will be 100% completely revealed. There's nothing

00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:02.600
 we can do to stop that from happening. Every single sentient being from every person, a

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:08.680
 little worm, gods in the gods realm, hell beings in the hell realms, the whole spectrum

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:16.680
 of sentient beings at the moment of the when that sentient mind leaves its body, its embodiment,

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:26.800
 the moment of death, its true nature is completely revealed. And so in Buddhism, that's really

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:32.800
 the amazing thing that we're practicing for. And all these Bardo teachings in Tibetan Buddhism

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:39.080
 taught by the Buddha, taught by Guru Padmasambhava really kind of have this key point at the

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:47.440
 center of them, that this moment is coming when we're going to die. And at that moment,

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:53.320
 there will be nothing getting in the way of our true nature fully shining. Our bodhicitta

00:09:53.320 --> 00:10:01.960
 will be bright as the autumn sky, unobstructed, limitless, open. And for that little window,

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:11.560
 it's there and there's nothing obscuring it. And so that's what really, that's why so many

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:15.880
 these great Mahayana practitioners and Tibetan Buddhist practitioners, they're like looking

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:23.600
 forward to that opportunity. And one way, that's what we keep practicing in this nundra teaching.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:27.760
 Every moment, we're trying to recognize that true nature. In the beginning, we try to recognize

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:35.960
 that nature. And then our practice arises as a refuge tree, and as ourselves supplicating

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:41.560
 it. And all these enlightened activities happen, we do the seven branch offerings, and we receive

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:47.680
 blessings, and then we mingle all the enlightened blessings of the wisdom beings, the actual

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:53.560
 Buddhas with our mind. And then again, we rest in open awareness, this nature of mind. That's

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:58.080
 what we keep practicing, even from one section to another, from the refuge section to the

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:04.480
 bodhicitta section to the mandala section. Our nature is there, it arises as a pure display,

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:10.560
 it dissolves and is the true nature. And then it arises as a pure display, then it dissolves

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:16.000
 as a true nature. It's always the true nature and its expression, the empty essence and

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:23.800
 its compassionate unobstructed display. So this is the same sequence of the bardos. We're

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:31.560
 practicing this every time we do sadhana practice. We're really trying to consciously do this

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:37.440
 with wisdom mind, so that when that time comes and our body actually stops working, it's

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:42.080
 outside of our control, then this will be like, Oh, we're kind of, Oh, we've done this, we've

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:46.920
 trained for this. We've been trying to merge all of our life activities with this wisdom

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:51.040
 awareness. And we have these formal practice sessions where we're trying to recognize our

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:55.560
 wisdom awareness, then mingle it with the blessings, the wisdom awareness of all the

00:11:55.560 --> 00:12:01.960
 enlightened masters, all embodied together as Guru Rinpoche and the refuge tree, and

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:11.200
 then mingle that inseparably and relax. That's what we practice every time in our sadhana

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:16.840
 practice. We're really rehearsing for this moment. And now the time of this life, everything's

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:23.480
 in our favor. We can consciously make our body sit down or stand up. We can turn on

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:28.960
 our bodhicitta or recognize our bodhicitta, expand our bodhicitta. There's so many things

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:37.540
 we have that are supports to this recognition for our bodhicitta to really shine brightly.

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:42.800
 And so that's really like, I know that fundamental urgency to use the time well. And it's why

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:48.580
 nundra accumulation takes so long. We're trying to really get familiar, this meditation gom,

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:52.760
 we're trying to really get familiar with what it's like to have, what is my nature like?

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:58.280
 What's it like to hear sounds through the nature? What's it like to see things while

00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:05.120
 abiding in the nature? That's a Vajrayana practice. From pure mind arises pure speech

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:11.200
 or energy arises pure forms. And that's kind of like a sadhana practice. And this great

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:18.240
 lineage of masters have given us all these techniques. The visualization practice is

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:25.720
 pure body and pure speech. It's called deity and mantra. And the completion stage practice

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:32.080
 or dissolution stage practice is pure mind or wisdom awareness. So we have pure body,

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:35.480
 pure speech, pure mind. That's like really directly pointing to what we're trying to

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:45.320
 begin every session with. Fundamental motivation of pure perception. So we're really training

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:49.960
 for how to use all of these experiences we go through. These mundane daily activities,

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:55.920
 washing dishes and going to work and loving people, caring for kids, paying bills, dealing

00:13:55.920 --> 00:14:00.760
 with suffering, getting sick, being there for someone else who's sick. We're trying

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:07.000
 to always mingle this with our wisdom mind and its wisdom expressions, its wisdom display.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.440
 So that's what Vajrayana practitioners are doing. So then when the moment when we lose

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:15.960
 all control of our physical body, which we don't know when that moment is, then it'll

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:21.680
 just, we'll be so familiar with the process. We could just let go and be at ease. That's

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:25.720
 really what we're practicing for. And then when that true nature of mind is revealed

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:32.080
 at that moment of death, when the body separates with the mind, we'll see it so clearly. They

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:40.280
 call it like a child jumping into its mother's lap. And that will be such a significant event.

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:48.200
 Say it's a type, it's a Dharmakaya enlightenment at that moment. And then the really like grounded

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:56.560
 like really deep humble truth of that. If all that's true, then the humble assessment

00:14:56.560 --> 00:15:04.680
 of that is that I have never done that. Because I would be so much more realized than I am

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:10.600
 now. Because I don't have any realization. But all countless lifetimes that that window

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:16.480
 opened and my true nature was revealed. When I died, how many lives does the Buddha say

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:25.680
 we've all taken? And I haven't done it because I can read my own mind now. So in that way

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:32.480
 is a very humbling. But it's also really encouraging because I am alive right now. And you're alive

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:37.680
 right now. We have all these practices we can do. We have this nundro. We can get really

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:42.000
 good and maybe hopefully more familiar with our own true nature, our own absolute and

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:49.120
 relative bodhicitta more than we ever have been before. And so this time when I die, because

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:55.720
 it's coming, then I can just recognize what I've been practicing this whole time. What

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:59.440
 all these empowerments, all these teachers are so kindly trying to point out to us again

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:09.720
 and again. Look at that. See what is deathless. Recognize what's unchanging. Amidst all the

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:23.720
 changing appearances. Look, discover for ourselves what's unchanging. What is deathless? And

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:31.360
 Yamaka calls this the middle way view. The great prajnaparmita, the great mahamudra, zogchen,

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:39.040
 great perfection, great completion. They're all pointing to this same thing. And so all

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:44.440
 these Bardo teachings, what does Bardo mean? It means the intermediate point between two

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:55.920
 usually illusory boundaries, two kind of bookends that we're holding. It's the in between Bardo.

00:16:55.920 --> 00:17:02.000
 A lot of, you know, sometimes this is talked about as like a liminal, the space in between.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.320
 So for sentient beings, there's birth and then death and then in between birth and death,

00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:14.600
 it's called a Bardo. We're in between these two points, even if they're not truly there.

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:18.860
 It's difficult to find an actual fixed boundary like the moment of birth. It's like trying

00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:25.760
 to really pinpoint where does day turn into night? Where does night turn into day? If

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:31.600
 we really try to look closely at that, we'll discover it is just arbitrary point and arbitrary

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:37.200
 boundary we set up. But we believe day becomes night and night becomes day. It really seems

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:45.120
 like that without looking so closely. But then there's all these transcendental logic,

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:50.040
 the logic that's pointing to the true nature, the deathless nature, the absolute nature,

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:56.120
 the wisdom mind we all have. We're using these techniques, this logic or these secondary

00:17:56.120 --> 00:18:01.440
 supports, all these conditions like doing a sadhana practice and taking a posture and

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:05.960
 visualizing a certain form and reciting a certain mantra, all these secondary supports

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:11.120
 to reconnect with that wisdom that's unchanging, that's always been there, that's stainless,

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:16.920
 that's a true nature of all beings. So in a Bardo, there's like a lot of ways to talk

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:22.600
 about it, but what this intermediate state, there's like three big phases in a human life,

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:27.680
 a sentient life, we'll talk about human beings. There's the time from when we're born and

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:34.600
 then we're living. That's one. And then at that point of living, at some point we'll

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:39.920
 have a scenario happen where we get some sickness or something will happen and it'll start our

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:45.920
 process of dying. And so from that process of when our dying begins to the moment of

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:53.320
 death, that's the second phase, second Bardo. And then the third is after we die, the moment

00:18:53.320 --> 00:19:00.400
 of death, then there's what's called after death or that Bardo that happens after our

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:07.160
 mind and our body separate. Then after that state, then we're born again. And then we

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:12.160
 go through a life and it declines and then it dies and then there's a gap of after death

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:17.440
 and then it gets a new body and it's born. And we repeat this three phase Bardo cycle.

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:23.880
 Birth into life, dying into death, and then after death before we're born again. And all,

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:31.440
 then the universe follows the cycle. It arises, expands, stays for a while, contracts, dissolves,

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:38.960
 becomes empty space until it arises again, expands, contracts, dissolves, empty space.

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:43.880
 And all of the cycle processes happen like this, the Buddha taught. So these are three

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:49.720
 Bardo's. Then within life, there's two more Bardo's. Bardo of a dream, entering a dream

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:58.280
 state and then having it dissolve and waking up. Bardo of the dream, that's between waking

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:04.520
 and then we dream and then we wake up again. Or the Bardo of meditation, where we're in

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:12.320
 our normal dualistic mind, then we enter a wisdom awareness, then that lasts for a certain

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:17.000
 period, then we kind of, our ego comes in and our dualistic grasping holds on again and

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:26.880
 then the meditation Bardo's over. So those are life and living and it includes meditation

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:36.280
 Bardo and dream Bardo. And then this dying into the moment of death where the mind and

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:41.720
 body separate. Right at that moment they say the true nature is revealed and that's called

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:48.560
 the true nature Bardo. Where unobstructedly our nature is there, there's no habitual patterns

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:56.480
 active to cover it up. And so it fully arises unobstructedly. That's called the true nature

00:20:56.480 --> 00:21:02.600
 Bardo. And then if that's too much and we don't see our nature then, it displays in

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:07.360
 various ways. And if that is like we're not familiar with that, we're not comfortable,

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:11.800
 we're not at ease, we're not allowing that experience to happen and merging with it,

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:16.160
 then the sip of Bardo. The Bardo of becoming happens where our mind tightens up, habits

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:22.360
 start coming back online. We start wondering to have some sense of grounded certainty.

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:28.200
 We want a body and so we can look for this body. This is called this Bardo of becoming

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:32.560
 until we actually, our mind gets a body and then birth happens again and then it's happy

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:41.080
 and birthday once again. So these six Bardo's, Bardo of life, dreaming, meditation, dying

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:46.240
 right at the moment of death, true nature. We miss that, Bardo of becoming and then we

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:53.040
 go and born again. So it's these six phases, six Bardo's. And then very simply it just

00:21:53.040 --> 00:22:03.560
 says two. From the time where we don't recognize our nature until the moment when we do recognize

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:10.080
 our nature, that's considered the length of a Bardo. So they say it's a point between

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:17.320
 a recognition of nature or not recognition. So the Bardo is between ignorance and wisdom.

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:23.640
 If we're in wisdom, that's called Rigpa in Tibetan Buddhism, then we're not in Ma Rigpa

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:31.280
 or ignorance, not wise. So the Bardo span is the span of ignorance until we recognize

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:37.640
 its nature and we're totally free and not in a Bardo. And then we're in this true nature

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:43.520
 and then however long that lasts and we miss our recognition, ignorance starts again and

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:49.600
 then the Bardo begins again. So they say fundamentally the only sentient beings have Bardo

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:50.600
 experiences

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:57.320
 because they're the only ones with ignorance. Wisdom beings don't experience Bardo because

00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:04.060
 they're not in ignorance, they're in wisdom. So they can see the sentient beings' nightmares

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:07.640
 but they don't believe in them. They're not banging around, they're not wandering between

00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:15.640
 nightmares. They're just seeing all the causation of how minds kind of bang around against their

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:25.400
 projections. So the point that all these Bardo teachings come back to again and again and

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:29.240
 again, and this is such a vast, if you're interested in this, this is really opening

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:35.600
 like a curiosity or a thread of inquiry. So many of these Bardo teachings again and again,

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:41.600
 they really come to everything we experience as our mind. It's like that now when we're

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:46.240
 awake. It's like that when we're dreaming. It's just an expression of our mind and we

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:55.320
 see that after we wake up. Meditation, it's all just our mind. When we die, it's still

00:23:55.320 --> 00:24:02.040
 just our mind. When our body separates from our mind, all we have is our mind. It's habitual

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:07.440
 residual self-sense, just like in a dream. It still feels like a body. It still feels

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:15.360
 like it's in a place. It's searching, wondering for things based on its own habits. So that's

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:20.500
 something, a thread we're trying to continue in all of this nundra practice. This is just

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:28.840
 my mind. That's why I can arise so flexibly. That's why the mandala can arise and then

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:33.600
 it can dissolve. Then it can re-arise and then dissolve again. It's going through this

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:38.760
 same sequence but we're trying to integrate our wisdom, our attention, our wisdom awareness

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:47.800
 with these same cycles, these same Bardo cycles. So we're trying to have our habits be refined

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:53.080
 and so how all the wisdom is there and then the habits arise and they kind of release

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:59.060
 and then they become the pure expression of that wisdom. That's what these sadhana practices

00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:04.080
 like nundra are trying to do. It's like Vajrayana, pure perception. It's fundamentally what we're

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:16.480
 trying to do is use all these experiences of life and dying and death. And so time is

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:22.440
 really short. It's of the essence. We only have a little window where this body is, all

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:27.720
 the function is holding itself together and at a certain point that the energy, some of

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:40.120
 the elements, they start losing position and then our body starts shutting down. So this

00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:44.040
 is like we're talking about this just intellectually like studying but we're trying to like survey

00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:48.320
 an upcoming event that's going to happen to us. Like seeing the obstacle course before

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:52.520
 we're in it, like being a climber and you see the route you're going to take before

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:57.640
 you're on the route. So that way when we're in it then we already have some familiarity.

00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:01.820
 We can be a little more flexible if surprise happens. We're already trying to get familiar

00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:08.800
 with what's the nature, this mind, everything's mind. What's the nature of this mind? We're

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:14.040
 trying to get really familiar with that. So when an expression of mind happens we don't

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:19.840
 shut down and our egoic fixation doesn't just shut everything off. And we just close our

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:25.680
 eyes and little ignorance cocoon. But we can just open and become more courageous like

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:31.800
 this great bodhisattvas. They'd really say this, the great bodhisattvas fear birth so

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:40.800
 much more than death. Because birth we can't control. We're born little babies, human babies

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:45.960
 for a solid year, two years. We can't do anything. Can't even hardly lift our head up most of

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:52.200
 the time. Can't walk on our own, can't eat, can't clean ourselves. We're completely vulnerable.

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:57.560
 And if we don't get some realization we'll have no control over that birth scenario.

00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:04.960
 But we can control now what our mind does during the process of death. These great Mahayana

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:10.640
 and Tantrayana practitioners are really putting all this energy so that when that death happens

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:16.480
 they can really seize that opportunity and let all these expressions happen as they are

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:21.240
 and recognize this is just my mind displaying and they connect with the deathless nature

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:27.120
 and they allow all the expressions to happen. And we've seen this with how these great masters

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:40.120
 have passed. Such enthusiasm, such happiness, like birds flying away. And that possibilities

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:44.880
 right in our hand right now. Because we have this precious human body and we have this

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:49.720
 very short window to use it. And it's definitely going to happen that the body will dissolve

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:56.320
 and die. But our mind will continue. This deathless nature is ongoing, it's continuous.

00:27:56.320 --> 00:28:00.960
 So these great bodhisattvas are trying to see how can I use this upcoming experience of

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:06.800
 death to get even more realization so I can benefit even more beings. And then we're just

00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:11.800
 following in their footsteps. For the first time we're really trying to actually get some

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:18.140
 deep realization so when this time comes it can be a complete celebration. It can recognize

00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:24.040
 this freedom nature that we have, that we've always had. It can really see it and then

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:28.800
 at the moment of death when there's nothing blocking it we can just lean, just open and

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:34.080
 just totally savor that and just reconnect with what we've been practicing all this time

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:40.800
 in our lives in this nundra practice and these different creation, completion, sadhana practices.

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:44.680
 It'll just be one of the delightful moments of our entire experience. We can really, that'd

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:49.920
 be the moment of liberation or enlightenment. That's really what we're practicing for to

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:57.040
 use that time. Why? Not to end the dream, not to stop experience. The dream can't be

00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:08.880
 ended. There is always a next. We can never be outside of interdependence. It's impossible.

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:15.840
 The nature always expresses form as emptiness. Emptiness is form. It all, essence, the nature

00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:26.640
 always has an expressive capacity. The mind always arises as knowing. They call it luminosity.

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:32.160
 Always has this moving energy so there's no way to stop the dream but we can use the dream

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:38.840
 for the benefit of ourselves and all beings. Make this such a wonderful, exceptional, extraordinary

00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:43.860
 dream for everyone we come in contact with and also that means to repay the kindness of

00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:51.880
 all these beings who've been our parents before and have shown us so much kindness in small

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:58.040
 little ways, in big, big ways for so much time. Then we can really develop some capacity

00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:04.680
 to really help them, like really to like actually love them unconditionally, like the four bound

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:04.920
less,

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:11.020
 you know. And then everyone's been our parent. We can have that view with all these beings.

00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:15.680
 This bodhicitta is so deep, boundless love, boundless compassion, boundless sympathetic

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:22.800
 joy, boundless equanimity, can really impartially kind of repay these debts we have, ways we've

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:30.400
 hurt others before. Make amends now. We can just totally buoy and uplift our experiences

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:40.000
 and these relationships we've had so long ago and really use this opportunity. So there's

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:45.480
 so many different teachings on this. Rinpoche, Kemposerong Rinpoche just gave these Amitabha

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:56.120
 teachings and Dubutta was so kind, gave all these techniques that even if we're not familiar

00:30:56.120 --> 00:31:01.160
 with our mind, I mean being familiar with our mind means you never lose the recognition.

00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:05.800
 That's what these great masters, they're so careful about karma. So even if they're always

00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:10.000
 stable and abiding in their nature, like if there's any little interruption, then they're

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:17.800
 really trying to have that not be there. Completely, they're going for completely uninterrupted

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:22.600
 awareness of their nature. So there's never a gap. There's never a Bardo experience. So

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:27.360
 then they don't, in that Bardo experience, then it's just a duality mind and whatever

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:40.000
 habit it comes up, they just, we grab it. We have no control over that. So this same process

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:46.560
 really is mimicked in every time we do this sadhana practices, this nundra. From this

00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:54.560
 open first thing, we always try to recognize our awareness. Then that awareness arises

00:31:54.560 --> 00:32:00.660
 naturally as unconditioned compassion, all arising samadhi, limitless compassion, not

00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:05.160
 because of an object, but it's just that's its nature. It's just completely unrestricted

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:12.400
 compassion. And then that empty flexible nature and that totally boundless compassion come

00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:17.120
 together in a more form or apparent display is the union of emptiness and compassion,

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:23.280
 the seed syllable samadhi. Like that's the beginning of every single visualization practice

00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:29.080
 we do. And they say that that emptiness is like that emptiness awareness, the first one,

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:36.800
 the true nature, samadhi, that purifies dying and death, the Bardo of dying and death. And

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:44.080
 that all arising compassion that just naturally comes out, purifies the after death Bardo.

00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:49.640
 And then when that distills or crystallized into a more apparent form and as a deity with

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:53.800
 the retinue and does all these enlightened activities, that purifies the Bardo of birth

00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:59.200
 and living. So every sadhana practice, we're purifying these three big Bartos of dying

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:04.200
 and death after death, and then birth and living. Like every single sadhana practice,

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:09.080
 that's what we're doing. We're purifying our normal, mundane, restricted egoic, and just

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:15.330
 kind of like the normal casual ways we experience every day. These sadhana practices were

00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:15.840
 completely

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:21.840
 transforming them to have them permeated by this wisdom, the deathless nature, our unchanging

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:28.320
 awareness. So this is right at the beginning of every sadhana practice. It's definitely

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:33.680
 the beginning of non-bro. And then as the, you know, in the refuge tree with Guru Rinpoche

00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:38.480
 and all the retinues, then that they do a light and activities of emanating and gathering.

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:42.160
 And we received the blessings and we mingle and merge with their blessing, their wisdom

00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:48.920
 mind and that dissolution happens back into the true nature. So we're really just mimicking

00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:54.280
 this same natural practice of rising emptiness, of rising as infinite compassion, distilling

00:33:54.280 --> 00:34:00.040
 as all these compassionate activities, which then dissolve into just bodhicitta and its

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:06.480
 absolute nature. And we're just constantly going again and again in this cycle, trying

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:14.160
 to purify our normal egoic sense of what this cycle of life of being born, living, dying,

00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:19.240
 so that when that process happens and our mind and body separate, then we'll already,

00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:24.740
 we'll have reoriented with this and we'll be coming more from a place of wisdom with

00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:34.080
 our true nature instead of from duality mind, which is just wondered forever, kind of banging

00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:38.960
 against its own projections.

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:44.360
 So this key point and just, it's great. I'm just to repeat it again. The answer is always

00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:54.480
 bodhicitta. The best way to use this moment is bodhicitta. Bodhicitta has relative and

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:59.120
 absolute aspects. The absolute aspect is the deathless nature, absolute truth, absolute

00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:05.200
 bodhicitta, unchanging nature. The relative aspect is all of its natural, rising, compassionate

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:11.160
 displays, boundless, the four boundless qualities and the activities of the six paramitas. It's

00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:18.080
 all bodhicitta. We can do this really simply. At the moment of dying, activate bodhicitta.

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:24.880
 That's the full package. Practice bodhicitta. If we ever wonder what practice should I do?

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:28.840
 Bodhicitta. Forever in our practice and we're wondering, is my practice good? Then if there's

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:40.080
 a bodhicitta, it's good. And if there's not, then we need to turn on bodhicitta. When dying

00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:44.560
 process happens, and I don't know, this is all just theory for me, but when everything

00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:50.640
 starts shutting down and I have no control, it needs to be really simple. My, what I go

00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:58.800
 to, needs to be really simple. For some great masters, they say, "Omani Pemehung." Purifies

00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:05.840
 all the three doors, the six doors, the six ways we could take rebirth, "Omani Pemehung."

00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:09.840
 So easy to remember, we can say it, "Omani Pemehung." Just for a moment in the after

00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:15.480
 death phase, if we disconnect once to our devotion to our teacher, our connection to

00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:23.680
 the three jewels, we let bodhicitta shine on once. Then the impact of that moment, when

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:29.280
 it's just our mind and its projections and there's no body holding it at all, the impact

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:34.040
 of that significant virtue, like the connecting to our own wisdom, is so powerful there that

00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:39.440
 we can get great realization. So right now we need to really get in that habit of when

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:46.280
 something challenge comes up, open, and have this, whatever this connection we have according

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:51.280
 to our instructions of our teacher, that we need to really get habitual with, "Oh, what's

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:56.360
 the easy thing? What's my simple answer? Is it Omani Pemehung? Is it to pray to Gurumache?

00:36:56.360 --> 00:37:04.080
 Is it to pray to Amitabha? Is it to activate bodhicitta?" Because at the moment of death,

00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:09.000
 and it's open, and if we don't recognize that, this cuny-bardo, the true nature, then that

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:17.040
 natural quality of just pervasive energy starts just arising. They say it's like sounds like

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:22.600
 thousands of thunderclaps. It's just a natural expression of the true nature, which then

00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:29.920
 takes more form like lights, which takes more form like all this kind of beams, which then

00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:35.240
 takes more form of deities, and then different kinds of deities. That's all within this,

00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:38.760
 it's just a natural expression, they say, of the true nature, and that little window

00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:43.680
 can be really quick after the moment of death, or it can take a long time, but it's usually

00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:51.240
 a little short. But that's all we're practicing in this sadhana practice of nundra. It's the

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:57.360
 same thing. We're just training in it, using our duality habits to connect to the openness

00:37:57.360 --> 00:38:02.680
 and let it arise as a natural display and be totally at ease and relaxed and with bodhicitta

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:07.440
 and compassion for all beings and then let it dissolve again. We're just practicing for

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:13.180
 that gap, the bardo of the true nature, and it just so happens that it makes our lives

00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:19.560
 happy too, and it makes our relationships better, and it makes our future so bright.

00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:23.920
 But we're really preparing to like, when those natural displays of mind happen, and high

00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:29.160
 teachings, togal teachings, this is the same thing. High teaching, trekto teaching, this

00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:32.840
 is the same thing. We're just pointing out that moment of death, that's what we're practicing

00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:37.880
 to recognize. Those are the highest teachings Buddha taught, Trekto and Togoss, all for that

00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:42.560
 moment, and these three samadhis are the same. I mean, it's what we're practicing in this

00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:48.040
 sadhana, which it's extraordinary that we've come across such amazing, extraordinary teachings

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:56.920
 that have been held so courageously, so carefully, for so long, for thousands of years, and we

00:38:56.920 --> 00:39:00.720
 can somehow have them. We can just open this sadhana book and start, which we'll do here

00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:07.920
 just in a couple minutes. It's like, how amazing fortune, you know. But at that time when it's,

00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:13.880
 that's why, why is Tibetan Buddhism so vivid? To say that, to let the true nature just shine

00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:20.720
 unobstructed, it's so brilliant, it's so bright, and so we're training also to like, let the

00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:27.440
 energy, the natural expression of our own nature, just let it pour out. Don't shy away from

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:32.840
 like, kind of the brilliant display. Just like, be open and let the variety of experience

00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:39.120
 happen. So that's also why in our sadhana practices, we're letting all these forms shape and take

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:44.680
 different shapes and go through different activities according to what the sadhana says.

00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:48.720
 To just get flexible, oh, it can be this way, it can be that way, it takes this shape, takes

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:53.720
 this form, and we're letting our mind be open enough that it just lets these experiences

00:39:53.720 --> 00:40:00.240
 happen and doesn't shut down or push away or play favorites. It just lets any of it happen.

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:04.800
 And so this sadhana practice, we're really training our mind to let its own nature radiate

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:17.200
 as it just will in response to like, what's actually helpful for beings. So it's such

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:25.560
 a rich topic. And the point is really, you know, these sadhana practices are so deep.

00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:30.840
 This nundra practice is so deep. If we can make this like a very easy thing to come to

00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:37.440
 our mind, the four thoughts that turn the mind, refuge in bodhicitta, making mandala

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:42.480
 offerings, purifying our habits, accumulating the wisdom, mingling our minds with the blessings

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:49.920
 of the lineage masters, the enlightened beings near and far and everywhere, then this really

00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:55.080
 we're making such a meaningful use of our life and that it's going to only help us during

00:40:55.080 --> 00:41:00.160
 all the challenges we face now and long into the future. And then there is this special

00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:05.200
 opportunity when we die that if we don't get full realization before then, then this moment

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:12.240
 will come where the true nature will inevitably arise and dawn. And then if we can recognize

00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:17.720
 it then and recognize everything as its display, this is just our display of the changeless

00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:27.960
 nature, our own mind. So I hope just my constantly, repeatingly saying the same thing is helpful.

00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:33.080
 This is just our own wisdom mind displaying. And that's what all these sadhana practices

00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:38.440
 we're trying to just get make friends with it where we enjoy it. And then we get into

00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:44.560
 post meditation and we can just savor it, savor the time with friends and family. And

00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:51.320
 just be, just have a such a gentle at ease approach which we've seen in all these masters.

00:41:51.320 --> 00:42:00.040
 So at ease and yet still so practical and so grounded and so with such overflowing gratitude

00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:04.560
 for the lineage that's maintained this and such humility for all these masters who've

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:09.520
 accomplished these practices that are stably abiding in this realization all the time for

00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:17.200
 so long now, lifetimes after lifetimes and they keep coming back and helping us. Such

00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:22.720
 wow to be a part of such an amazing extraordinary thing to be practicing something, a term I

00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:27.760
 revealed by as long as Nudjir Rinpoche, to receive pith instructions from our own personal

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:32.760
 teachers, your personal teachers. It's like such a fabulous, really kind of like can't

00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:39.360
 even explain or conceive of a more precious opportunity. And we have it now. So I'm so

00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:44.000
 thankful to be doing this with you and these are really just reminders for me to not waste

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:49.480
 my time and really take this to heart, the opportunity that this life can actually end

00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:55.720
 with total liberation, complete enlightenment. If it really sees this opportunity it's totally

00:42:55.720 --> 00:43:02.560
 possible and even if I've never done it before because I haven't, then I can this time. If

00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:08.520
 I just put in the time and keep relaxing, keep following in the footsteps of the Buddha,

00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:19.360
 that that's a very real possibility for anyone who really does that. So, thank you.
