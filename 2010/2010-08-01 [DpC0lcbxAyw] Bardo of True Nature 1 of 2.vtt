00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.400
 "And this is up to that this moment of death and dying is as we said yesterday. From the time we

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.000
 got sicknesses that will lead to that situation.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:28.170
 Until these two elements forcefully trapped it, consciousness, movement, until that is the moment

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:35.000
 of death and dying. Until that is the moment of death and dying."

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.810
 "The moment you begin to experience or realize this organ nature as one of which I am talking about

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:45.000
, that is the beginning of the true nature of the Bardo."

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 "This is the Bardo of True Nature is now beginning."

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.020
 "And again great meditations can see that status all actually reach enlightenment. Right there,

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:07.000
 there is no more Bardos now going through. You reach the enlightenment right in that moment."

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:15.040
 "But then those who were then recognized, then now we are going to continue the Bardo of True

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.000
 Nature is coming."

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:27.420
 "And the teachings say this genuine experience comes to everyone. From the great practitioners,

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:35.000
 even the lowest state, insect can experience this clay-bling status."

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:47.130
 "But a big duration is so small, how long it stays? Just instant. One may be instant, one second.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.000
 Sticks, too short."

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 "Short because again it just carries away with all this. It's just a short time."

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.070
 "But good practitioners in this long time, practicing, this is not what you heard, such as Satness

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.000
 Samadhi as we have been discussing."

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 "And such as Tichu we have been discussing, or Mahamudra Tichu, or the Paryaparamudra Tichu."

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:23.320
 "This is, now we begin to see exactly as we learn, we practice it, and we will do it in a direct

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.000
 philosophical status."

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 "There is nothing that has to be used in any reason, logic or anything. We will see that."

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:42.060
 "See, and we catch that moment with our awareness, or ask what this is, and then, as I said, no

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.000
 more partisan."

00:02:44.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 "We didn't recognize this, so then other vadu of the true natures began to come."

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 "This true vadu of the true natures come, as in Tichu said here, vadu of the true natures."

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 "Then many things will come. This all is our display of the mind."

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 "It's all appearance of our mind."

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:28.060
 "Again, vadu of course, we always in the teachings said, and we know that, we kind of like, we

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.000
 believe, we always believe."

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 "This vadu of the true natures, last forty-nine days, we may be think that."

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 "But this is not exactly forty-nine days."

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 "Mostly in the teachings said, this vadu of the true natures could be even just a few hours."

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 "Or even maybe days, not really long as."

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 "Even in the teachings said, for example, vadu of the substitute of Humbarana,"

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.320
 "first day you will have that week, second day you will have this week, and this Dayana, that Day

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.000
ana."

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:13.200
 "This is could be for the, I mean the teachings said, those great masters said, it can be for those

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.000
 great practitioners."

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 "Can extend that now."

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 "But for just ordinary beings, this day is duration of your mental stabilization status."

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 "And there is many kind of way to call it in the teachings."

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.250
 "Sometimes called cycle of the meditation, day of the cycle of the meditation, and cycle of the

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:38.000
 time."

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 "And this is the cycle of the day, of the meditation."

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 "So it is individual, you see, the major individual stabilization of their sammas."

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:58.380
 "Startled from whatever second and wherever they can hold or can maintain that stabilizer, that

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.000
 count as one day."

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 "For the period of the meditation."

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.440
 "So it is, for the most of the folk, those who don't have the really stabilization of the

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.000
 concentration,"

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 "this true nature, vadu, is just could be very, very short."

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.180
 "But of course you can't tell in the teachings that the individual is different, the elements and

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.000
 so forth."

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:31.910
 "They are different, so could be last like three days, or three days, but is not performed like

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:35.000
 this, performed like this."

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 "It is short."

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 "But whatever that is, however, no matter what the duration is, then begin to now dawn."

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 "And it depends, again in the teachings, it depends on the individual's elements."

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.000
 "Or individual, their color, their habit, and this, and that, it depends."

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 "But this first comes the song, big song, and this is life, and life."

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 "And this is, again, nature of our minds."

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
 "It is token experience."

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 "It is expression of energy, of the ordinary nature of the samadhadvara,"

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 "man and woman, or ordinary nature of our elements."

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 "It's not really coming any from outside."

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 "They go here, in the teachings, they bend on it all, they bend on the terror and fear."

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 "They recognize that what even arises is self-appearance of the awareness."

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 "One's own, one's own appearance."

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 "It's your, our appearance."

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 "Again, we have to think, appearance, of course you all know this, appearance."

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 "Or perceptions, or conceptions."

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 "Perception and conception is not outside of the talk."

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 "That perception aspect is our own mind."

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 "That conception aspect of death is our own mind."

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 "That generally can ask you all this time, for example."

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 "When we see something, it's our mind."

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 "Truly all thinking of that scene is our mind."

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 "Thinking of unhealed is our own mind."

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 "That is truly, even in this lifetime, perception is our own mind."

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 "But in that time, definitely it's also our mind."

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 "It's like dream."

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 "Dream is not somebody else dreaming when we are dreaming."

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 "It's 100% our own dream when we dream."

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
 "It's also totally personal."

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 However, nobody else dreaming is I dream, where I dream.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
 It's 100% my dream.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 Similarly, that time, experience, no matter whatever,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 it is our vision and our experience.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 And this is coming, all those visions coming,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 it's a reflection, power of the awareness,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 power of what's old in the natural mind is coming out

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 because there is no bindage of any physical,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 anything out is really open, on open matter,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 matter in the open land.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
 Therefore, all those are coming.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
 And because also at that time, less now, habitability,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 coming out of that old energy status,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
 not too much involvement of the habitability is there.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 Still, all the habitability, emotion is almost a kind of like very lucky,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 underprivileged.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
 It's there, but it's not active.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 Therefore, all this is coming out.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 But many times, not ever, many times we see as terrors,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 that's clear to prepare that, and then we miss it.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 But if we again see this is our own display of the mind,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 or the awareness, or the expression, or clear light ministry,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 and of our nature of the mind, then no more other powers.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 You reach again to the Sambukai state of Dhamma.
