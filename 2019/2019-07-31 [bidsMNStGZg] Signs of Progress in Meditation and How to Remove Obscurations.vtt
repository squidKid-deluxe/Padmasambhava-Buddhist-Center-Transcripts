00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 If you could talk a little bit more about how we can assess in ourselves kind of the progress and

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.490
 the development of our devotion, so you know, for reflecting, of course for the benefit of beings,

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.500
 wanting to cultivate this devotion, what are qualities we're looking for in ourselves to say, "Oh,

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:23.450
 this looks really good, you know, my devotion is maturing", or what are qualities we might see that

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:29.000
 we should be aware of and should recognize, "Oh, I need to cultivate more devotion here".

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:45.490
 Okay, that is a devotee, of course, but what did the teaching say? It said, "Sign of the educated

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:56.000
 person is gentle and peaceful".

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 "Sign of the realization is less negative emotions".

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:14.560
 So that is really the very good, good, simple explaining about one's own self, how we can guide

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.000
 ourselves.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:26.070
 Somebody else's guide to us, to say something, that will be, many times, upsetting. It's not easy

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.000
 to accept.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 But one's own every guide, guide ourself, how our practice is doing loving.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.640
 And that is then just a devotee, of course, devotee you're asking, but also how much our loving

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.000
 kindness, compassion is developed,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:55.990
 how much time we spend practicing meditations, how much accumulation practice level, how much I've

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.000
 completed,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.090
 how many completed, all of those, such as Mundo practice, how many I've completed, how much I've

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.000
 completed.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 And then emotional level, what I used to be, and now what I am now, and how many completed.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 And then devotional level, of course, also you can judge yourself how much, what I've started with,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.880
 devotion or pain, and what I'm now, that you can judge. So I think those are the ways you can ask

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.000
 one's own self,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 we read our own mind, mind is not really out of anyone's, can see, by anyone except our self.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 So guide our self, by our self is, a quality teaching is really the best.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 And as we're assessing ourselves, you know, going over these qualities that you're speaking of here

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.000
,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 and we're noticing places where, you know, oh, my devotion's a little stuck here,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 I'm noticing these qualities aren't quite ripening, particularly in relation to devotion.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 Are there practices in particular that are beneficial to highlight,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 to help us kind of move through obstacles to devotion?

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.800
 That is, I think, the only and devotion, that is, I think, true, really practices, such as in the

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.000
 teachings said,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 guru-yoga practices and the various other practices.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.910
 And this is why it's blocking that devotion, according to teaching, it is because of our obsc

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.000
urations.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 So the purification practices, accumulation practices are really the best according to teaching.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 And target with that, and feel some, or have some intellectual thought,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 and I'm going to feel more devoted to my practice, my, and I'm going to develop more devotions.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 And then with that thought, and also, see, see, that qualified teacher,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 or whatever you like to have devoted, see, that teacher or those teachers being quite kind and good

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 and all that.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.660
 And then in the teaching, always say, you should see teachers, call it as three different, three

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.000
 kindness,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 kindness of the teaching, kindness of the transmission, kindness of the empowerment.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 And also, the teachings said that, so also reflecting those, those thoughts.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 And then there's a few more different ways to think, but I will talk more to you.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 But those are really the way we should go on that.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 But mostly to the really practices, such as guru yoga practices,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 and bodhicata practices, and accumulation practice, various other practices.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 That was increasing. That also devolves.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 Thank you, Krishnaji.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 Thank you. Yeah, I'll go there, and then I will come. Yeah.
