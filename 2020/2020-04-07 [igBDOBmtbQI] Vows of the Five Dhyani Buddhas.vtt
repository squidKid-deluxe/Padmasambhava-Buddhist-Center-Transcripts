00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.040
 Thank you very much, everyone. Thank you, everyone. Again, I talk really about Dharma. Dharma,

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.880
 according to my capabilities, and I share some about Dharma.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:29.680
 Dharma, and again, or to follow the Dharma, or listen to the Dharma, Dharma always in the teaching

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.520
 mentioned, and as well as all the great monsters to correct the motivations.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:42.520
 So, this time, we are also going to activate our beautiful motivation of the Jhos and the Ven. Bhod

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:55.840
hi Jata and the Vedya teachings of the three Vedya states, all five perfection states.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:03.950
 Those certain motivations are always necessary, important, and foundation of the practices. And

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.880
 with that beautiful motivation, now we follow again the teachings.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:16.030
 As we were talking about the life, as the great master, his only Dunyul Rumbuji, Ojyapya Dunyul R

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:23.540
umbuji, taught one of these teachings, heart and stockings, of only our teachings, in a very simple

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.240
 way, direct way.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:34.130
 This is how we can put entirely teaching as simple practices, practices so that it can benefit

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:40.240
 ourselves, and some really also benefit from other beings.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:48.900
 And so, in that teaching, as we were following and said, also we are trying to take the principle

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:57.240
 goal, principle whole goal of the practice is to really make meaningful of our this very life that

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.240
 we have this life.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:06.240
 This life is so precious, and therefore we have to really make this something meaningful.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:15.240
 And again, Buddha said, all the great master said, with many examples, how it is so important.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:27.780
 For example, the great master said what? Some individual has beautiful solid golden bow, but that

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:35.240
 golden bow, that individual is using as like a garbage can.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:44.760
 I mean, if I use that word, garbage can, what people think that, most everyone think, oh how

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.240
 foolish, it's not wise, not smart.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:58.240
 Why that individual uses such a beautiful golden bow, solid golden bow, for using as garbage can.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:05.700
 Or something can be like, kind of like unnecessary activities. People are going to say that, it's

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.240
 not really kind of wise way to do.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:18.240
 But he said in the teaching, this is the more unwise, every spoil our own spiritual lives.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:27.240
 It's more precious than the golden bow, solid golden bow, everywhere is there, every this wise way.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:35.240
 So that means what we have to do, we have to line up to our inner good qualities.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:42.910
 All Buddha nature, something too good with kindness, compassion, love and wisdom combined together

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.240
 some activities.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:49.240
 And when you start to do that, that is known as then practicing dharma.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:56.240
 That means practicing dharma is not something that we have to follow the regimen to kind of rules

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:01.240
 and guidelines outside that we have to impose to our own self.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:10.270
 So, practice dharma is to apply, revere our goodness, our inherent richness or treasure that we

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:16.240
 maybe can't ignore so many times, can't really look to that.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:23.540
 That which is revereling, we revere that beautiful qualities, we revere that beautiful qualities or

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.240
 those beautiful qualities.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:33.520
 Then we're talking here, as Japatiya Dhunyanma said, we're taking the advantage of this beautiful,

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.240
 reassuring importance.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:43.910
 And when we do that, what? It's going to benefit to our self, benefit to all the beings, directly,

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:45.240
 indirectly.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.240
 And therefore, that's what we talk.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:56.900
 Although to do that, as simple manual or the guideline or the teachings taught, always reflecting

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.240
 the poor thoughts or poor renunciation thoughts.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:06.240
 That I'm using different terminology, but you all know poor thoughts.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:15.580
 Breaks life, our breaks body, life is difficult to obtain, that reflect on that meaning, and then

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:23.240
 impermanence, cause and effect are inevitable, and samsara has always challenges.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.240
 Those are the four points.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:31.240
 These four points are also simple, direct, natural, where things are.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:37.240
 It's not just Buddha said and then can we follow that, but this is the reality.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.240
 This is the fact. We are in that status.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:47.340
 Whether we believe or whether we don't believe or whether we pronounce that, whether we don't

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.240
 pronounce, that doesn't change.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:06:02.240
 Nobody can say life is not gracious. Nobody can say it is not impermanent.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:08.240
 Nobody can say cause and effect are inevitable.

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:15.240
 Nobody can say samsara has no difficulty.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:22.060
 That's it. That's the simple. That's the direct. That's it. So we reflect in the way things are

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:23.240
 true, the exact as it is.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:29.890
 When we do that, what it does, I said so many times and you know, you know we heard from the

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:32.240
 teachers and they read in the books.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:41.510
 It will make our heart more soft, more tender, more calm, more kind of cooperatives, more

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:44.240
 respectful and appreciated to each others.

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:51.240
 Really, it will make more gentle, more peaceful, more practical and more friendship.

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:57.240
 We can see the value and importance of our friends, our family members.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:06.240
 Members, we kind of are not going to hanging solid in it, can't relate a self regiment attitude.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:12.240
 Those are all the soft in the Bible, reflecting the truth, the exact as it is true.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:23.240
 So therefore we're talking about now, among those four points, we're talking about this third one,

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.240
 cause and effect are inevitable.

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:33.770
 I mentioned again a few times and you all know. So now I'm not going to repeat too many of other

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:34.240
 things.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:43.850
 But what is it? In the Buddha's teaching, there is what's called the virtues and guidelines that we

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:48.240
 kind of against it or we break, then it becomes un-virtuous.

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:57.130
 And those guidelines again, as I said the other day, nothing but to bring more hours and more calm,

00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:06.240
 peaceful, gentle, more simple, more cooperative, more respectful and appreciated to ourselves,

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:12.240
 respect to the others or self respect, respect to the others.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:20.620
 That is really these old guidelines, simple, easy, it's something so nice, it's harmonized, it's

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:27.240
 blended exactly with nature and it is how it should be, how it should be our life.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:35.280
 Our life should not be communicated according to the teaching. More simple, more calm, more

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:36.240
 peaceful.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:45.410
 Because our life is more simple and calmer, calmer, what it brings is more peaceful, more calm,

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:47.240
 more friendly.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:54.220
 Friendships, that old brain, our life has become more kind of a communication and not friendship

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:59.240
 and we can't really challenge all the time, clashing all the time.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:09.460
 We even call it samsara fulfillment but it's practical. A cold Buddhism or dharma, it is. So

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:11.240
 therefore it is.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:20.240
 These old guidelines are so good, it will benefit and help, support that situation, those things.

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:26.930
 Now when I talk these things and what we are talking about, in Buddhism there is what is called

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:28.240
 three vowels.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:35.240
 The patrimul chal, the vinaya vowels and bodhisattva vowels and vedayana vowels.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:43.240
 So among those three we went first two. Now I talk really again this last one.

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:51.430
 Last one is vedayana vowels. Vedayana vowels has a number of vowels for the guidelines according to

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:53.240
 different tantrums.

00:09:53.240 --> 00:10:00.240
 And what that means? Different tantrums mean there is at least six different tantrums.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:05.240
 Those are three outer tantrums and three inner tantrums.

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:13.240
 And so each of those again has different guidelines. However to summarize that,

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:22.980
 almost generally what was explained by the great masters and said five vowels of the five dhyana

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:24.240
 buddhas

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:35.690
 and fourteen dongtuls and eight big ones. And so I will talk really about these five vowels of the

00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:37.240
 five dhyana buddhas.

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:46.240
 And among that first one is the tathagata, the vowels of the tathagatas.

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:54.240
 All that I used in other words, the samayas of the tathagata buddhas.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:11:12.230
 And that samayas of the tathagata buddha is taking refuge, or vowels of the refuge, as well as

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:15.240
 three moralities.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:23.610
 Three moralities vowels. And together with that bodhichata vowels, such as vowels of the vision bod

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:27.240
hichata and actualizing bodhichatas.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:31.240
 Those are the vowels of the tathagatas.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:37.240
 The second is vowels of the vedya, vedya payments.

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:47.540
 Vedya family vowels of the samayas is, and the teaching says, always keep the bell and the golgi of

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:50.240
 the vedya and bell.

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:57.070
 All which is, of course, many of you know that. This is called dolgi in the vedya, and this is

00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:58.240
 known as turvo.

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:05.240
 And so always in the teaching says, keep the vedya and the dolgi.

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:14.580
 What actually that really means, dolgi representing of the skillful means, and the turbo or the

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:18.240
 bell representing the wisdom.

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:27.240
 So always keep the skillful means, wisdom, never separated.

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:38.470
 Compassion, wisdom are combined. Skillful means, compassion. Compassion and wisdom unite together

00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:40.240
 all the time.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:48.240
 Every aspect of the vedya and the teaching, it surely really known as skillful means and vedya,

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:50.240
 skillful means and the wisdom.

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:59.090
 And then along with that, one who shows those, clearly of those, what is skillful means, what is

00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:02.240
 wisdom, that is the teacher.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:12.240
 So respect, listen, follow, following the qualified teachers' instructions.

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:24.360
 One who tells clearly about skillful means and the wisdom. So that is principle vows of the Vedya

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.240
 families.

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:37.790
 The third one is vows of the Renna families. Renna family vows are, in the teaching says, always

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:41.240
 give the poor generosity.

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:51.950
 Always do the full kind of generosity practices or generositys. Sharing, sharing this, openly

00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:59.240
 sharing the core of your capabilities and readiness of others.

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:09.990
 What are those three? First one is generous of the material, material generous practices as much as

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:11.240
 you can.

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:20.750
 Second is the generosity practices of the teachings of all the wisdoms, all those wisdoms and

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:22.240
 teachings.

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:32.240
 And third is the generosity of the protestions. Support, help, open the arms, open the heart.

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:40.600
 Support, if you can, according to your capabilities and according to the need of others, always

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:42.240
 make that open.

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:51.040
 And then the poor generosity is the foundation, is the best of all the positive generositys, which

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:58.240
 is always the great generosity of love, kindness.

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:04.550
 When we do the generosity of the material or very easily with all the wisdom of the teachings or

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:14.240
 protection of the support, always with love, always with kindness, compassion or lightness.

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:25.310
 That is what is known as poor generousness. That is principle vows of the Renna families or Samayas

00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:28.240
 of the Renna families.

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:45.240
 And the fourth one is vows of the Renna families. And the Renna family vows are in the teachings,

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:45.240
 always keep the teaching as your heart, teaching as your heart.

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:54.240
 What that means? What are the teachings? The teachings of the outer, inner and secret teachings.

00:15:54.240 --> 00:16:01.480
 All the teachings, such as the teachings of the Sharvaka Jana, Parthi Buddha Jana, and Bodhisattva

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:02.240
 Jana.

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:17.240
 Inner teachings are such as Kriya Jana teachings, Upa Yoga teachings, and Yoga Jana teachings,

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.240
 those teachings.

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:29.290
 And in secret level, teachings of the Mahayoga, teachings of the Anu-Yoga, and teachings of the Ati

00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:30.240
-Yogas.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:42.240
 Keep the teachings as your heart, keep into the heart, keep as your light.

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:53.240
 All right. And that is principle, kind of simple, principle vows of the Renna families.

00:16:53.240 --> 00:17:04.240
 The fifth one is vows of the, the vows of the old, the fifth vow is vows of the Karma families.

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:14.860
 Karma is actually what means karma, action, activity, action. So keep all the vows of every Devotee

00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:15.240
.

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:25.170
 The Tatagata family, the Renna family, Renna family, Bema family, keep all and then the Karma

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:30.240
 family vow, keep all those vows, all those.

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:38.910
 With your activities of the body, activities of the speech, activities of the mind, keep those vows

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:39.240
.

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:50.240
 Totally keep up all your commitment, what you committed, what you said I will do.

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:58.410
 In front of the teacher or in front of the shrine or whatever your commitment, such as sessions,

00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:03.240
 morning sessions, afternoon sessions, evening sessions.

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:15.210
 All such as Rachel's, Colma, Colma offerings, Yanya offerings, whatever you committed to keeping up

00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:21.240
 those, those are known as the vows of the Karma families.

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:31.260
 So those are the five diem but the principle vows of the five diem. And then putting down poles and

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:33.240
 add big ones.

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:40.290
 And I'm not going to go all through those things. You can look those easily into different books. I

00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:41.240
'm not going there.

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:47.240
 But those are known as the vows or the samayas of the Vedayana teachings.

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:56.000
 Vedayana teachings many times, people think all this Vedayana teachings is like there is nothing

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.240
 much to do.

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:07.240
 That is not really true. Vedayana teachings are more compact. Vedayana vows are more compact.

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:16.240
 And Vedayana vows is more encompassing, not more, it encompasses entirely Buddha teachings, vows.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:24.240
 For example, in the morality what we are talking at the very beginning, three moralities, what we

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:24.240
 said.

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:28.240
 The vows of Dattagada family, Buddha family vows.

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:35.240
 Morality, first we are talking about what in the teachings said. But what is vow that exists?

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:41.240
 That avoiding all the negative vows of the, avoiding all the negative videos.

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:49.240
 That summarizes entirely Vinaya vows. That summarizes.

00:19:49.240 --> 00:20:00.090
 And then the second one, that morality what it says to you. And perform your thought, perform all

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:01.240
 the benefit activated for all the sentient beings.

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:09.300
 That encompasses entirely bodhisattva, Mahayana bodhisattva vows, benefiting for all the sentient

00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:13.240
 beings by your comparison, your loving kindness.

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:20.590
 And Vedayana teachings, it's really in compact, so, because many people think that all Vedayana

00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:22.240
 teachings are so easy.

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:28.240
 There is nothing to do then, it can't be like casual, and just all that.

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:35.240
 Those are said in the teachings. Who can do that? Those are high-carbability practices.

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:42.240
 What is the teaching of all to use examples of the King Indira Buddhist? King Indira Buddhist.

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:49.470
 He can do it. He and his, that, his high-carbability practices, he don't have to give up his, that

00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:55.240
 individualist those don't have to give anything, don't do anything, as it is.

00:20:55.240 --> 00:21:02.240
 Use that. But to do that, they have to have, have realization.

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:07.240
 See, everything is displayed of the wisdom, primordial wisdom.

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:17.290
 See, exactly three various states, as it is, not talking, not practicing, not presuming, not

00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:23.240
 intellectualizing.

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:33.240
 Not just conceptualizing. Truly see, exactly as it is, as a guru-be-masana.

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:40.870
 For example, those individuals, for example, so that the great yogi or great Mahasya, drinks all

00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:45.240
 the alcohols, consumes the alcohols.

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:52.240
 But for them, alcohol is not alcohol as we prosecuted, lost the mind to us.

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:58.240
 For them, it is a wisdom, eternal wisdom that does.

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:09.240
 All playing the game with the wisdom goddess, mamakis, playing is completely different.

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:18.240
 We sing different. Those great yogis, great girls who drunk so many gallons of the alcohol,

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:19.240
 consumed all.

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:27.240
 There is no history. They are drunk. They did messing up so many things.

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:37.240
 All completely are thus intended as wisdom nectals, nourishing as quiet, extended, or a digger,

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:42.240
 what's called, accelerated of their realization and understanding.

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:45.240
 So that is really how it is.

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:50.240
 So therefore, and for that reason, what we are always in the teaching state,

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:55.930
 thinking, kind of thinking of the Vedayana and doing something like, kind of, everything is okay

00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:56.240
 then,

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:59.240
 we kind of could really lose the ground.

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:08.290
 We are going to lose. For that reason, only practitioners should not imitate the bodhisattva

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:10.240
 activities.

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:18.240
 Bodhisattvas, rugal bodhisattva should not imitate the Buddha activity, should not imitate.

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:28.240
 Should stay where they are, read their capabilities, read their mind, read their, judge their

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.240
 emotions,

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:33.240
 judge their grasping and clingings.

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:40.240
 And if they don't have grasping, they don't have emotions, they, we can do.

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:45.780
 Otherwise, we should follow according to the upper cup of the lip. Otherwise, according to the

00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:50.240
 teaching, it will really create more handling and obstacles.

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:56.240
 All that is known as breaking the samayas or losing the vowels, so forth, all those.

00:23:56.240 --> 00:24:04.240
 And then, number is negative, can't relate, can't develop, become then, become the obstacles.

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:09.240
 And for those reasons, what is really known as always in the teaching state,

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:17.240
 the drawers of the obstacles, or drawers of the negatives, or drawers of the breaking the vowels,

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:19.240
 what are those?

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:26.240
 There is four things, I just have listed that, and of course you will know that, you all know that.

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:35.540
 And those four are, first is not recognizing, recognize, so that means, sorry, first is, maybe I

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:36.240
 shouldn't say,

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:53.240
 first is ignorance, first is ignorance, and second is disrespectful.

00:24:53.240 --> 00:25:08.880
 And third is carelessness, poor is too much emotions, those poor are the cause that we can do the

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:10.240
 mistakes.

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:19.240
 First is unknowing, or the ignorance I said, but unknowing, unknowing.

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:25.700
 Of course, if we don't know what is guideline, what is not guideline, what is negative, what is not

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:26.240
 negative,

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:34.240
 if we don't know, then we can do things. That is the foundation there.

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:42.900
 But once we know what is good, what is bad, what is good and what is bad, or what is positive, what

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:44.240
 is negative,

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:49.240
 then, if we did the negativities, what are those?

00:25:49.240 --> 00:26:00.240
 There could be disrespectful, or there could be careless, or there could be power of the emotions,

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:03.240
 our emotions.

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:08.240
 There could be, then it becomes distributed.

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:16.280
 So, these vowels generally, how good are usually the names of those vowels, are as like, what is

00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:23.240
 called, block energy of the, what is called this name, living.

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:36.240
 Name, or living, these vowels are the name of the living, block in the, floating, floating,

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:39.240
 floating water is coming,

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:46.960
 all the way, the sediment, so much water is coming to you, we are trying to block and put the walls

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:48.240
, walls.

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:56.240
 These vowels are the walls to block the, the habitation is going to invade us.

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:59.240
 These vowels are what these levities are.

00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:07.240
 These levities are actually, are mindfulness, alertness, coefficientness.

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:15.640
 This is what these vowels are, or this levitt, or this block energy of the habitation, of the, the

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:20.240
 real of the habitation, when it is invaded to our mind's streams,

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:27.240
 or invaded to our, our body, our speech, and our mind.

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:37.230
 So, what that levitt is, is the, as you say, is mindfulness, is alertness, it is consciousness,

00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:39.240
 consciousness.

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:43.240
 So, therefore, this is so special.

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:51.910
 So, this how we can spoil. How can spoil that even we know that we can spoil, then we did

00:27:51.910 --> 00:27:54.240
 disrespectfuls,

00:27:54.240 --> 00:28:01.420
 and that could be as like, kind of like, negative emotions, or whatever, or the stubbornness, or

00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:02.240
 air or guns,

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:10.360
 and some relief, we cannot, or some relief, or that never mind attitude, and all that is deep, don

00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:11.240
't, is disrespectful.

00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:15.240
 Not so keen on that.

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:23.240
 And then second is, is the carelessness, or thought is carelessness.

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:28.240
 And the fourth is too much power of the emotions, then it happens.

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:33.240
 But once those happen, then what is good, then it becomes negative.

00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:39.240
 Once you see that happen, then it is always in the teaching state, we reify that.

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:46.510
 Naked has no good qualities, but one of the best qualities is, if we really work for that, we can

00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:47.240
 purify that.

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:49.240
 We can clean away that.

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:55.240
 To purify, there is that many methods in throughout the Buddha teaching measures.

00:28:55.240 --> 00:29:03.240
 And, and such as in Vinaya teaching, also there is many, many, many purific methods.

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:11.910
 Anyway, bodhisattva sutramayana, such as also doing the practices of the 35 Buddhas, all with both

00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:12.240
 sessions,

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:19.240
 and kind of like, highlight of those in whatever negative happens, whatever you are in memory,

00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:25.240
 highlight those in mental state on the presence of the Buddhas and bodhisattvas, or 35 Buddhas,

00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:32.240
 joining those prayers, prayers, and dedicating that merit for the living beings.

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:40.240
 Those are known as purification of the systems of the sutramayana.

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:45.240
 Then our meditation, our meditation activity, all will purify, actually that.

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:53.240
 Anyway, in the teaching, the most powerful one is, then such as to do various other practices.

00:29:53.240 --> 00:30:00.330
 We did that, we all received teachings and then struck them, so that, and that will clear away, it

00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:02.240
 will smooth and purify, and all that.

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:10.040
 And there is nothing, no negative with it that cannot purify the power of the antidote or the power

00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:12.240
 of the meditation practices.

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:20.240
 And that's always in the teaching, such as, for example, like Angulamala, who killed so many people

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:20.240
.

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:33.600
 According to the teaching, today it killed 999, nine individuals, according to the instructions of

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:39.240
 his negative teachings, that he did that.

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:45.240
 But once he got understood, and once he met the Buddha, and he really understood that,

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:52.040
 that have terrible things that he did through his power and courage and commitment, he purified all

00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:56.240
 that negativities, and he become ahadangut.

00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:04.080
 That's not that this negativity is purified in a kind of so many lifetimes. Within that single

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:10.240
 lifetime, he purified according to it, he become ahadangut.

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:17.970
 So this is the example. There are so many stories, stories that those negativities, many people

00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:19.240
 individually did,

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:25.760
 but once they realized that, that really pushed them so strongly, pushed the board of the great

00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:28.240
 courage and commitment and confidence

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:35.560
 and practicing dharma and purify, become great masters, great masters, really great, like

00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:38.240
 accomplished masters that happened.

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:45.240
 So this is about how it is. Therefore, purifying negativities is so, so important.

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:55.240
 And now, I'm going to summarize that. And now, all these negativities and positives is nothing but

00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:56.240
 a display of the mind.

00:31:56.240 --> 00:32:05.870
 These all come from mind. Positive mind develops positive, all the virtues are good things, and

00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:13.240
 negative mind develops all these negativities and unrighteous activities.

00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:22.120
 And therefore, always thoughtful our activities. More thoughtful, more careful with mindfulness,

00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:28.240
 alertness. Mindfulness, alertness and consciousness are thoughtful,

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:36.140
 is really as the great masters, teacher standing right with you when you have that. It's always

00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:40.240
 supportive, always available, always with you.

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:48.240
 Therefore, then, when we have the mindfulness, we are in a good state, we are in a good direction.

00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:56.490
 So that is really my choice aboard the cause and affectors are inevitable. Again, cause and affect

00:32:56.490 --> 00:32:58.240
ors are inevitable.

00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:08.640
 That we all, they are not really going to change. The cause, cause, the good cause cannot bring the

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:14.240
 bad result. Bad cause cannot bring good result.

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:19.730
 That's it. They are not going to mix. And that is the same thing as externally, when we look to the

00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:20.240
 seed.

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:27.240
 Seed and all these things. All things in the world, what things come. Always follow that.

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:38.200
 So that is my bridge of the among the poor, renowned sessions, and this, the third one. Cause and

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:41.240
 affectors are inevitable.

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:47.690
 Okay? I'm going to start with you. Thank you, thank you very much, everyone, and for coming and
