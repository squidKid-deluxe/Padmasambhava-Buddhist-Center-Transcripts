00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.680
 Same name, 18 times, 2500 or 2600 years ago, the name was also Kushingar and now it's called

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:15.360
 Kushingar, so it came here. I think that time, this Kushingar is not really good, nice city,

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:23.200
 not already old looking city. And he reached to the Chishala city and he told him, "Now,

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:29.640
 this is the place I'm going to enter mahaparinirvana." Ananda said, "Why you enter the mahaparinir

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:29.840
vana

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:36.160
 that is really the world poverty, not good failure, maybe something better." And then

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:42.160
 Buddha said, "You couldn't say that. This is a similar history." Buddha told so many

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.840
 histories, so many great things, so many great powerful things, warm up another thing in the

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.840
 past. They all ruled here and stayed there. Easily long restored of the Chishala. This is the

00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:01.840
 perfect place to enter mahaparinirvana. So he told Ananda, "Hold my robe four times, lay out on the

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:09.680
 ground, in between Chishala trees." I think this is maybe Chishala trees, salt trees. And then his

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:18.320
 head is facing to the north and the lion's horse as whenever you all know. Head is facing north

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:26.400
 and in the right shoulder is on the floor, right side is on the ground, left up and then extend the

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:38.880
 left arm along the body and his right palm rest on the on the head. And then he said these four

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.480
 seals of the teachings, again he repeated, that I think whenever you know all compound things in

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:57.120
 the parliament, all the emotions are the source of suffering. Every phenomenon exists in the

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:10.000
 emptiness and the egolessness. And the nirvana is totally fixed. That four seals of all

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:20.160
 emblem teachings of the Buddhist. He repeated again, again and then he laid down. And then

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:29.200
 again he said all phenomena existed is impermanent. And this is my last voice that you will hear.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:36.000
 And don't neglect. The voice of the enlightenment is very rare. You must observe that in the heart

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.680
 and the mind and everybody can make it. And then of course many of those who are rich, they reach

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.680
 Arhata and they feel very upset and they start crying, lot of emotions that but everyone is

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.360
 staying silent and quiet and then Buddha et al Mahabharata. And third is such a deep state,

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.760
 observance state of mind. In the teachings he said he's completely become so silent.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:04.960
 Even the external breath is completely stubbed but still the inner breath is moving so beautifully

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:12.560
 subtle and represented to the most highest, the most observance state of mental consciousness.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:19.040
 And I think in Tibet they called something rajjicimo, the peak of the samadhi he went.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.000
 And then that time many Arhata told the Buddha completely, they told Mahabharata and Nirvana.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.720
 A great Arhata, Mangava said no, still Buddha is the most highest peak of the consciousness

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.320
 or the observance state of mind. Still his mind is there. And they stayed for a short time

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:42.960
 and then Buddha et al Mahabharata told Mahabharata and Nirvana. And so that is supposed to be this

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.000
 place.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.680
 And after I think because Buddha they thought to be permitted immediately or soon after that

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.760
 but they they put so many this kings of the many kings and queens they bought so many

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.880
 can really break his wood, the central wood and all the things trying to permit but prior didn't

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:08.880
 catch because Kachapa, Kachapa was not there. Maha Kachapa was still in rajjicri so then they

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:15.920
 informed it, informed it and Kachapa came. And there's another one in the teachings said

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.440
 Arhata nor the following day who is meditating on the northern side of the mountain Sumeru.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:27.200
 He also completely meditated and the moment I think they rang the bell there's a call in

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:33.680
 Tibet or in the Dharma there's called in Gindi. Gindi is a long string you put on here and they

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:40.800
 banged this. So he heard that voice that sound so strong he thought what is this through his

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:47.670
 meditating then he saw Buddha is entering Mahabharata and Nirvana. So he came immediately to that

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.760
 and

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:54.480
 then Kachapa came when Kachapa arrived he looked the Buddha's body and that was final kind of

00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:02.800
 final view of the Buddha's body and then that moment then salt emanated fire came

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:13.600
 and burned then cremation cremated or burned. So this is the place.
