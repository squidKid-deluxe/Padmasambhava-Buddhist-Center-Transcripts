00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:47.320
 Again, be together, discussing the teaching of the Buddha.

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:51.320
 According to the past kava bullet, with our joy, love,

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:53.320
 and the devotee, shown in the determination

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:58.320
 is one of the very beautiful qualities to pursue

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:03.320
 and to discover our spiritual journey or the innate Buddha

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:04.320
 nature.

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:07.320
 We're making something beautiful things.

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:11.320
 Make difference to ourselves, to all the beings.

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.320
 According to the teaching of the Buddha,

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:16.320
 following the teaching-- and that's what all of these 37

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:19.320
 practices of Bodhisattva, as you read,

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:23.320
 it is nothing but teachings on the loving kindness,

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:26.320
 compassion, courage, and commitment,

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:30.320
 how to preserve that collet in the jungles of the samsara.

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:33.320
 There's so many difficulties, challenges, and blockage,

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:35.320
 one after another.

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:40.320
 But how we keep up our principle, our identity, our beauty,

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:45.320
 our collet, our inheritance, bring forth joy, and peace,

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:49.320
 happiness, and respect, and appreciation.

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:52.320
 Harmonize the tree everywhere, wherever we go,

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.320
 and wherever we are.

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:57.320
 And that is our goal, and that's this teaching.

00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:00.320
 This is how wonderful, how beautiful.

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:04.320
 This is truly one of the very special things

00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:07.320
 that we can do in our lives.

00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:10.320
 So therefore, again, restenstaining.

00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:12.320
 Again, Bodhichata.

00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:14.320
 Kindness is a comparative thought.

00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:16.320
 We're gathered here today, and we're listening,

00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:18.320
 and reflecting this teaching.

00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:21.320
 Nothing but to really improve ourselves,

00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:25.320
 to make benefits to every living being, and how I can do.

00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:28.320
 How I can follow the footsteps of the Bodhichaktamuni,

00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:32.320
 and all the Bodhisattvas, all those great masters we so call,

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:36.320
 we call great master, great practitioners.

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:40.320
 They're not just one time as born with great masters.

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:44.320
 They continually pursue the practice as we follow Him,

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:48.320
 kept exactly courage and commitment, and determination,

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:51.320
 and joy in preserving that.

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:55.320
 And continually, they had challenges too, difficulty troubles.

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:58.320
 But they'd overcome everything into the contracts

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:02.320
 of the Bodhichata, peace and harmonics,

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:05.320
 and bring the joy and the peace,

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:08.320
 and the joy and the peace to every living being.

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:11.320
 Happy now, happy future, happy continually,

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:14.320
 and that was the, therefore, part of the Bodhisattva

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:22.320
 is part of joy, part of peace, part of rewarding to others.

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:24.320
 It's not just a lip service.

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:26.320
 We're talking from the bottom of our heart.

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:29.320
 That's what the teaching is all about.

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:31.320
 So therefore, again, it's so wonderful,

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:34.320
 and today we continually, again, as we went through

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:38.320
 these 37 practices, among the 37 practices,

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:44.320
 if we look, I think today we are in the fourth standard,

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:46.320
 which is already translated into English.

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:49.320
 And again, this is, again,

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:52.320
 is continually as a foundation part of the practices,

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:54.320
 foundation of the Bodhichata,

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:58.320
 and it supports our practice and the performance

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:01.320
 of the Bodhichata and six paramata practices.

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:03.320
 How much we should have this?

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:06.320
 All that is explained one after another.

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:10.320
 And today, this teaching is again, stands forth

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:14.320
 according to this 37 practices of the Bodhisattva.

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.320
 Today is the fourth, I think.

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:19.320
 It is a teaching on the impermanent.

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:24.320
 Impermanent is, in a way, we are kind of encouraging

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:28.320
 to use our time and the situation,

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:30.320
 something beautiful way.

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:33.320
 We're not going to waste this time.

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:36.320
 At the same time, impermanent this teaching means

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:40.320
 we're not going to grasp and cling too much.

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:42.320
 Even though we're grasping and cling too much,

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:45.320
 it's not going to last as we want,

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:49.320
 as grasping as clingings want.

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:51.320
 It's not going to happen.

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:54.320
 Therefore, we have to be supple heart

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:58.320
 for courage and compassion and accept the situation.

00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:03.320
 So, this is what he said, and this is what he said.

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:09.320
 So, if I read this, "All friends, relatives, all separated.

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:15.320
 Positions and gain with effort will be left behind.

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:23.320
 Consciousness, the guest, will leave the guest house of the body.

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:28.320
 And therefore, to let go of these lives."

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:31.320
 This life is the practice of all the subtle.

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:34.320
 What this means is to live the lives of these,

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:39.320
 not grasping too much, not clinging too much.

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:42.320
 All this is going to change.

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:45.320
 No matter how much powerful we are,

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:49.320
 how much expert we are, how much strong we are,

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:53.320
 how much efficient we are, nothing is going to change.

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:57.320
 This is what phenomena exists in this nature.

00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:59.320
 It's nothing mystery, too.

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:02.320
 It's not just Buddhist drama.

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:07.320
 Buddha said that it's something only happening to the Buddhisms.

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:12.320
 Whether we pronounce that or whether we don't pronounce it,

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:15.320
 this is what it is.

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:18.320
 How are we going to take care of this?

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:23.320
 How are we going to be not disturb our mind, peaceful mind?

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:27.320
 And how are we going to maintain our joy and appreciation

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:32.320
 and bodhicata, thought, to help with all the sentient beings?

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:37.320
 That is not grasping, not too much clinging on this.

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:43.320
 And therefore, this is here, this great Master used three points.

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:47.320
 This is all the friends, everything will be separated.

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:51.320
 Everything what we accumulated is going to leave behind.

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:58.320
 And not just only that, but even our closest one that we have,

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:05.320
 and so dear, came this sense we born, which had the birth,

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:09.320
 to get with myself or me.

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:12.320
 Well, we have to separate that.

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:15.320
 Not just don't make any other things.

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:19.320
 This even have to leave this.

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:23.320
 This is called, when we reflecting that, closer to this,

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:28.320
 is known as reflecting the impermanent.

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:32.320
 Impermanent is the part of everything.

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:37.320
 Because of the impermanent, that's why we came here, first places.

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:42.320
 If there's no impermanent, we won't be here.

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:47.320
 This is how all this change in variety things, all these things,

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:52.320
 because of the impermanent, this is.

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:58.320
 And this, for example, friend and family will be separated.

00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:01.320
 For that reason, what we have to do?

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:04.320
 What we have to do? We should enjoy with our friend and family,

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:07.320
 well, we are not separated.

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:12.320
 Well, we are together. We should enjoy.

00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:16.320
 Our gathering will be the families by the great master,

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:20.320
 as Kancin Parthi Sharanbhojit I, quotations.

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:25.320
 He said, said, as great master, Parthambha Sanjis.

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:28.320
 What is Parthambha Sanjis said?

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:36.320
 Said, gathering of the family and the friend is as the gathering on the flea market.

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:46.320
 As gathering in the flea market, how long flea market lasts?

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:51.320
 Not going to last for a long time, just a short time, in a way.

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:59.320
 Well, we are gathering as friend and gathering there, what we have to do?

00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:03.320
 That's what the great master, Parthambha Sanjis said.

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:08.320
 Enjoy. Be nice. Be kind to each other.

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:12.320
 Be respectful to each other. Support each other.

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:17.320
 Instead, fighting, arguing, quarreling.

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:24.320
 That means we are spoiling our short gathering in the midst of the emotions.

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:27.320
 That's very unskillful.

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:33.320
 We enjoy our friend and families with love and compassion,

00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:36.320
 and courage and commitment, support each other.

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:40.320
 That is according to Buddhism. It's practice.

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:45.320
 That is Dharma. This is the foundation of Dharma.

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:51.320
 This is good conduct. It's morality.

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:57.320
 It's a beauty of spaciousness. It brings joy and happiness and peace to you.

00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:02.320
 It brings joy and happiness to others, and that is Dharma.

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:06.320
 That is the heart of the Buddha's teaching.

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:11.320
 Bring peace and harmony to myself, to others, with respect and effort.

00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:14.320
 Learn from each other. Support each other.

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:20.320
 Use those gatherings as learning of the six Parthambha practices. So forth.

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:26.320
 All that. And therefore, not grasping, clinging,

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:31.320
 yet nice and kind and compassion and respect.

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:34.320
 That is the practice of the Bodhisattvas.

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:40.320
 Then, the next one here said, "Oh, Dharma, we've made so much effort

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:46.320
 to gather, to help the wealth, or to propagate, and so forth.

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:50.320
 Also, we shouldn't grasping, clinging too much."

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:54.320
 Enjoy the wealth. Enjoy what you gather.

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:59.320
 In the context of love and compassion, joy and appreciation.

00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:06.320
 Let enjoy myself. Let enjoy others according to your capabilities, readiness.

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:10.320
 Readiness, and not to again grasping and clinging.

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:13.320
 Each time, what the great Master do you see?

00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:17.320
 You make that offering as mandalas every time in the mornings.

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:21.320
 Whatever the belongings, you make that offering mentally

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:26.320
 to all the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, and to make this benefit to all the beings.

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:32.320
 That means, bring joy and peace, harmony, and cause of that.

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:39.320
 That, and if we do that, we are making using of our belongings.

00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:43.320
 And the same, not to grasping, not too much clinging.

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:48.320
 Clinging, every grasping, clinging too much, what it does?

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:54.320
 It brings more emotions, more negativities, more worries,

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:58.320
 more anxieties, more emotions.

00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:02.320
 Then, our good time of short life, we in a way,

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:07.320
 spending in the midst of the thunderstorms of the worry and the anxieties,

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:14.320
 and anxious, anxious, and suffering, anger, emotions, raging,

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:17.320
 we become very unskillful.

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:25.320
 Instead, kind of joy and happy and appreciation, easy, and enjoy that.

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:28.320
 That is practice of the Buddha Dharma.

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:33.320
 Using that, peace and harmony is the central column of the Buddha's teaching.

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:39.320
 Teaching to yourself, to the others, enjoy.

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:43.320
 And try to use this to bring more joy, sustaining practice and meditation,

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:46.320
 and do good things to yourself.

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:51.320
 And without too much grasping, then we are making the difference.

00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:57.320
 We are practicing the Bodhisattva Dharma, Bodhisattva practices.

00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:01.320
 And the next one, what I said here, I mean, is it isolated in the next?

00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:07.320
 Conscious guest, here used as a metaphor.

00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:11.320
 This was in the Buddha's teaching, many times, used as a metaphor.

00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:17.320
 Conscious guest, guest house, is our body.

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:23.320
 And sometimes, in the Gurba Sambha teaching, it is a rented house.

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:29.320
 Rented, rented house, from where? From poor elements.

00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:35.320
 From earth, water, fire, wind, we rent it.

00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:38.320
 But in time, we occupy that.

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:45.320
 Our consciousness becomes the occupancy of what we rented.

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:52.320
 That means, what things we rented is not going to stay forever with us.

00:28:52.320 --> 00:29:03.320
 That also applying, before we come this earth, our body is not.

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:07.320
 We don't have our body.

00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:16.320
 According to the Buddha's teachings, we came with our consciousness.

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:23.320
 We concept it through the karmic consequence in a mother's womb,

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:28.320
 by the elements of the parents.

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:35.320
 And so, that is the beginning of our house, what we rented.

00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:40.320
 Consciousness is residing ever since.

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:46.320
 And consciousness, this body, rented is, is the element.

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:52.320
 Such as, as I said, fire, water, wind, and earth.

00:29:52.320 --> 00:30:00.320
 Earth, it is subject to very rapidly changing in permanent status.

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:06.320
 And we changed it so many times.

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:13.320
 Changed all the progress since from the time we concept it.

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:23.320
 Come out from the mother's womb and then as an infant, baby,

00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:32.320
 and child, and then teenagers, grown up, and then in the old,

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:37.320
 old, kind of a middle age, and the time of the golf,

00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:42.320
 and also other kind of way, and all those beautiful things.

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:47.320
 And then more golfing, more excitement, all these things.

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:54.320
 And then we go into this, then this body will say, I cannot do.

00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:57.320
 I can do those, all these things now.

00:30:57.320 --> 00:31:01.320
 I did my best, and I will leave this.

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:05.320
 Because this is the component of this element.

00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:08.320
 It is particles all come together.

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:14.320
 It is changing rapidly, every minute, every second, every moment.

00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:17.320
 It is moving according to the Buddha.

00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:21.320
 Even we can detect it by our eye, and settle in permanent.

00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:24.320
 It is continually moving, continually changing,

00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:27.320
 shifting things back and forth, and that's it.

00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:32.320
 And then it brings the grossing permanent as getting old and so forth.

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:37.320
 So therefore, also not too much grasping, clinging,

00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:40.320
 but taking care of this body.

00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:46.320
 This body is so important, it is a vehicle to be, to get enlightenment.

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:51.320
 And what the great Master Shanti Deva said, this body is like boat.

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:58.320
 Boat, to have this boat, we can cross the ocean, cross the ocean.

00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:01.320
 This boat is also not going to last forever.

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:08.320
 Therefore, don't waste the time, use these opportunities.

00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:12.320
 And this body, then in the Buddha's teaching, we went at the very beginning,

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:14.320
 they ate in dormant qualities.

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:20.320
 It's much more precious than the size of the gold, like this, or diamond, like this,

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:22.320
 or even the whole world.

00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:28.320
 This boat is so precious, so special, so beautiful, and yet fragile.

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:36.320
 And that delicate is very delicate, delicate.

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:40.320
 It's very, very, it's so special.

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:46.320
 And even though it is old, not too much grasping and clinging,

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:53.320
 and it takes you this time, are we able to do all this, what we went through?

00:32:53.320 --> 00:33:00.320
 That was all known as practicing the Dharma, practicing of the Bodhisattva practices.

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:06.320
 With Bodhisattva in the heart, and keep up these practices, then we become,

00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:14.320
 you become the true Bodhisattva, male and female, the warriors of the enlightenment,

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:19.320
 warriors for the Buddhahood, and to benefit beings.

00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:21.320
 That is what it is.

00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:29.320
 So therefore, here I said, give up, that give amin, no grasping, no too much clinging to this.

00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:35.320
 This is all, everything is like magic, everything is like dream, dream.

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:38.320
 And everything is reflection only in the water.

00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:44.320
 And having that understanding, and keep the open mind with full,

00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:50.320
 full shining light of the love and the compassion and wisdom in our heart and the mind,

00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:53.320
 that is practicing of the Bodhisattvas.

00:33:53.320 --> 00:34:00.320
 So that is really about, about this, this fourth one.

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:05.320
 Again, this fourth one, the standard, is thinking of the impermanent.

00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:08.320
 Impermanent is so spacious.

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:17.320
 What Buddha's teaching said, said, if we have the close in, have the realization of the impermanent

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:17.320
,

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:27.080
 our heart becomes so soft, so tender, and more respectful to ourself, more respectful to the others

00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:27.320
.

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:31.320
 We feel the sense of the time, and everything is really precious.

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:37.320
 We're not going to think it's insignificant, so special, kind of drawn to the earth.

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:43.320
 For that reason, Buddha's teaching said, among all the conceptions, all the thoughts,

00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:47.320
 the thought of impermanent is supreme.

00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:55.320
 Even Buddha encouraged, you may offer so many great beings, or so many like Ahabas,

00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:58.320
 but he's making that and thinking of the impermanent.

00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:03.320
 He said, thinking of the impermanent more available, more precious,

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:06.320
 than making offerings to so many Ahabas, all this.

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:11.320
 Even that, Buddha encouraged how important it is, that.

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:15.320
 And many great masters, every of those practices, lineage masters said,

00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:19.320
 if you have the really closely understand of the impermanent,

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:23.320
 your dharma, your life will be complete on the spirituals.

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:28.320
 Your life will be completely in dharma. It will come in dharma.

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:33.320
 And for that reason, many great masters said, thinking of the impermanent,

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:39.320
 it will make beginning your heart, our heart is more soft, more tender, more gentle,

00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:44.320
 more thoughtful, that beginning, and therefore then we begin to do the good activities.

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:47.320
 That's something beneficial to ourselves, others.

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:51.320
 And while you're already in that state, if you start continuing thinking of the impermanent,

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:57.320
 it will continually keep our practices on the path, on the highway.

00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:05.320
 We're not going to deviate it, divide it, or we won't run on the ditches.

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:09.320
 It always brings back to the track. It always maintains that.

00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:14.320
 Because of that, continually with that, then, finally, fulfillment,

00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:19.320
 we will become enlightenment. Realization, it really brings.

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:24.320
 Therefore, at the very beginning of our practice of lineage, of the Mundo practices,

00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:27.320
 what is? That's four renowned second thought.

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:31.320
 One is thinking of the impermanent.

00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:35.320
 This is, as I said, it's not just a Buddhist dogma.

00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:38.320
 It's not just a Buddhist theory, theory that makes that.

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:44.320
 Truly, this is. What is this? We're not covering up things.

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:50.320
 Looking directly to the face of the reality, where things are natures on the phenomenal world.

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:54.320
 And we reflect that, strongly as it is.

00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:58.320
 It is also a wisdom. It is a wisdom.

00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:03.320
 It is an understanding. It is a knowledge.

00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:11.320
 So that is what the practice is, again.

00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:19.320
 The next one, the fourth stanza, this is.

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:26.320
 Now, again, this is. Now, in order to perform, in order to be very successful,

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:29.320
 in order to practice, our practice becomes very successful.

00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:33.320
 To bring more, we have all those beautiful now things.

00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:36.320
 In a way, we have the precious human body.

00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:41.320
 We cannot detach it. We have the detachment, or we have the detachment,

00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:45.320
 or we give up so many attachments, grasping, we're trying to soften our heart,

00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:50.320
 and as well as we have some realization of the impermanence and all that things.

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:55.320
 Even though all these things, what we need now, next is,

00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:59.320
 to bring, in order to bring the performance of this,

00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:04.320
 then we should avoid the negative influences.

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:10.320
 From negative influences, from our close ones.

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:12.320
 Negative influences.

00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:16.320
 Negative influences will make then what?

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:20.320
 Obstacles. Obstacles to our performance.

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:26.320
 Obstacles to our path, and our achievements.

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:30.320
 And that is what we should watch out.

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:37.320
 Always bad influence from our close ones.

00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:39.320
 And that is here.

00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:45.320
 When furniture with someone caused the three bosons increases,

00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:52.320
 degrades the activities of the listening, reflecting, and meditating,

00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:56.320
 and destroys the loving kindness and completions.

00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:59.320
 Then what is?

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:07.320
 Give up that companions is the practicing of the body circles.

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:13.320
 This is again, is hard advice to all of us.

00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:18.320
 To everyone, actually, of course. It's very practical.

00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:23.320
 Practical and very targeted to produce the performance

00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:28.320
 of our beautiful goal and the beautiful views.

00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:38.320
 And to not let influences ourself with the bad companions.

00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:42.320
 Or someone that goes closer to us.

00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:50.320
 But the activities are kind of in that context.

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:54.320
 In the three bosons. Three bosons, what are those?

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:56.320
 I mean, of course, you know, three bosons.

00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:59.320
 Buddha used the metaphor as three bosons.

00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:02.320
 It's three negative emotions.

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:13.320
 Ignorance, or the darkness, attachment, and anger.

00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:17.320
 These are known as the three bosons.

00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:25.320
 No matter how big, how small, it is a boson.

00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:27.320
 What that means?

00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:32.320
 Posen hurt us. Posen will hurt us.

00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:35.320
 Posen will disturb us.

00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:38.320
 Similarly, this will disturb us.

00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:40.320
 We already have these emotions.

00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:44.320
 It's not something that we are free of these emotions.

00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:51.320
 But if we are influenced by our close ones in these contexts,

00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:53.320
 what it does?

00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:59.320
 It will ignite our bosons, our emotions.

00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:02.320
 Then it will disturb.

00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:06.320
 Not just disturb only my or I, me.

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:11.320
 But it will disturb our families, our friends,

00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:16.320
 our neighbors, our countries.

00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:22.320
 And then, in case, if it's so powerful, the whole world can be disturbed.

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:27.320
 By who? These three bosons.

00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:34.320
 They are the fundamental source of the whole troubles,

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:42.320
 silences, uncomfortable, miserable, sufferings in the world.

00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:45.320
 We read this. You read this.

00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:47.320
 It's nothing again.

00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:54.320
 Brother talking something strange, alien things bring kind of new consumption to our mind.

00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:57.320
 It's true.

00:41:57.320 --> 00:42:00.320
 Because bodies are what we like to do.

00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:02.320
 We like to remove these things.

00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:07.320
 We like to transform the dullness into the bursums.

00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:14.320
 We like to transform the attachment in the loving kindness of the great comparisons.

00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:22.320
 We like to transform anger into such a kind and compassion, love to every living beings.

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:25.320
 That is what it does.

00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:33.320
 It is like medicines. It's rejuvenating ourselves, rejuvenating our family,

00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:40.320
 friends, neighbor, town, city, country, whole world according to this.

00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:43.320
 Truly, it is medicine.

00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:46.320
 But this is powerful medicine.

00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:49.320
 Healing powers, healing tools.

00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:55.320
 So these healing tools can be demologized or decreased or covered up

00:42:55.320 --> 00:43:04.320
 and ignite these three bosons by the influence of our close ones.

00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:10.320
 Then we cannot help to even ourselves.

00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:13.320
 Don't make any help to the other beings by both each other.

00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:17.320
 Instead we hurt them, begin to hurt them.

00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:23.320
 So therefore, to every way, looking to myself, looking to all the beings,

00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:29.320
 we try to work every way to decrease of these three bosons.

00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:36.320
 And therefore, at this way, the close ones can influence and increase all these things.

00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:42.320
 Then it will. And that all the activities and bad habits and so forth.

00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:47.320
 If we do this, then we become bad habits.

00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:50.320
 We demolish the good moralities.

00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:57.320
 That all. We are undermining the hardcore of our beautiful principles.

00:43:57.320 --> 00:44:00.320
 So therefore, knowing all those things.

00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:07.320
 So trying to distance those close ones who have a lot of negatives

00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:11.320
 or a lot of powerful negatives can influence this.

00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:15.320
 If that happened, then, of course, if we are practitioners,

00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:18.320
 have we already practicing what we will do?

00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:21.320
 Then this next second, second standard says

00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:27.320
 it will degrade the activating of the listening, reflecting and meditating.

00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:30.320
 It will degrade that.

00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:33.320
 Then we not become practitioners.

00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:35.320
 Practitioners.

00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:40.320
 Instead, we become the practitioners of the old habit patterns

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:43.320
 which are disturbing to us, disturbing to the others.

00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:47.320
 Others. And this, and what is listening?

00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:51.320
 Listening is the practicing, like listening is the teaching.

00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:53.320
 Reflecting the teachings.

00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:55.320
 Teaching or the starting.

00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:58.320
 Listening, listening that.

00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:01.320
 This is, I mean, we went this last time.

00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:03.320
 That detail. And so I won't go.

00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:09.320
 But this is very, in order to do brain realization, we need these three things.

00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:12.320
 Because you have to listen, receive the teaching.

00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:17.320
 This teaching of the Bhadakshatyamuni is not just about overnight created things

00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:19.320
 or the last centuries.

00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:25.320
 This long lasting lineage of the wisdom and compassion from 200, 2600 years ago.

00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:27.320
 Continuing this.

00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:33.320
 Follow in the footsteps and part of this great master's, great practitioners.

00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:36.320
 Practitioners. And therefore, we should learn.

00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:38.320
 We have to learn. We have to know this.

00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:43.320
 Every teaching is not just strange like we are learning something new from us.

00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:47.320
 Every teaching is really right to sing to our heart.

00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:50.320
 Everything is how to improve ourselves.

00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:53.320
 How to improve our understanding.

00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:59.320
 How to improve our knowledge and our character, our concentration.

00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:04.320
 How to bring joy and peace, happiness to me, to all the beings.

00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:08.320
 That is all about the teaching when we learn this.

00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:11.320
 Every teaching ranks to our heart.

00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:15.320
 Connect to our love, our compassion, our wisdom.

00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:22.320
 Or how to remove our anger, emotion, and ignorance, and jealous, doubt, and hesitation.

00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:26.320
 How to remove those and strengthen all our goodness things.

00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:28.320
 That's the old teaching.

00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:34.320
 So learn the expert's voice to glorify our goodness.

00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:36.320
 It is listening.

00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:39.320
 And then reflecting.

00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:41.320
 Here reflecting.

00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:43.320
 Listening and reflecting.

00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:47.320
 That is contemplating. Sometimes translated to contemplating.

00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:50.320
 You're going to contemplating, reflecting.

00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:55.320
 As the Buddha told, it's not just the Buddha said and followed and believed immediately.

00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:59.320
 That's the blindfold. Blindfold believes.

00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:08.320
 You have to reflect. You have to contemplate how it does.

00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:11.320
 And even simple ways. It's true or not.

00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:15.320
 When you reflect, it's just what Buddha said, what you have.

00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:22.320
 It merges together, inseparable, without any divisions, even one here, between there.

00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:28.320
 It is all merged as water to the water, sky to the skies.

00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:32.320
 That is known as reflectance.

00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:38.320
 The result of learning and reflecting is practicing.

00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:39.320
 It practices.

00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:41.320
 We practice and meditate.

00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:48.320
 And with beautiful motivation, beautiful thoughts, thought within.

00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:51.320
 Motivation, devotion, we practice.

00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:56.320
 With that, practices such as vipashyana, or samatha vipashyana,

00:47:56.320 --> 00:48:02.320
 and vajayana teaching, completion stage practices, and creation stage practices.

00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:05.320
 Practices or according and structure.

00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:12.320
 All that is within the contracts of love and kindness, compassion, bodhicitta, joy and devotion,

00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:14.320
 courage and commitment.

00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:19.320
 All the six parama, the contracts that you utilize.

00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:29.320
 So, if we are influenced by the close ones that have the larger negative influence with close ones,

00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:33.320
 we will lose all these good qualities.

00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:38.320
 We lose the leaning qualities and reflecting.

00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:45.950
 And then as well as practicing, we distract completely in the world of the surface of these three

00:48:45.950 --> 00:48:47.320
 poisons.

00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:51.320
 When that happens, what is happening?

00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:54.320
 Physically, we become wild.

00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:57.320
 And verbally, we become wild.

00:48:57.320 --> 00:49:03.320
 Our soft speaking thoughts maybe now become start changing.

00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:11.320
 So, physically, wild, crazy activities, crazy things, verbally disrespectful,

00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:15.320
 and very verbal, and very kind of harsh, harsh.

00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:21.320
 And then, deep down in the heart, what is happening?

00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:29.320
 He said here, last one, completely racing up, or covered up.

00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:34.320
 Our loving kindness, our compassion, completely covered up.

00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:37.320
 So, look at the level of the surface, we don't have any love.

00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:39.320
 We don't have any compassion.

00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:41.320
 We don't have any respect and appreciation.

00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:48.320
 Become raging, raging, self-important ego, and that even could not succeed there.

00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:54.320
 Because the darkness of ignorance and anger and attachment,

00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:56.320
 even we couldn't fulfill our good things.

00:49:56.320 --> 00:50:06.320
 Even the ego want completely, but yet controlled completely by the self-ego and important.

00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:13.320
 So, that is the error and the mistakes of the negative influence from the close ones.

00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:20.320
 For that reason, he said, give up that, or distance that, for a while, until you have the strength.

00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:22.320
 Become stronger.

00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:27.320
 Stronger, when we do this, that is practice of the Bodhisattva.

00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:31.320
 You're preparing, we're preparing to grow up our self-image stronger

00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:35.320
 so that we can help to those beings and others.

00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:42.320
 We're not crushing under the forceful external circumstances, situations in that midst of things.

00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:45.320
 And that is the practice of Bodhisattvas.

00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:47.320
 We're preparing this.

00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:51.320
 Once you give up this, when are you able to do this?

00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:59.320
 Next one is, then, here, he said, what is now we need?

00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:07.320
 Now, opposite of that, opposite of that, we have to contract with a good friend.

00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:14.500
 Good friend that we can be as we can follow, we can see the good friend as a role models of

00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:15.320
 ourselves.

00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:22.320
 Who has love, who has compassion, kindness, knowledge, wisdom, common sense,

00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:26.320
 and don't the earth humble and more respectful.

00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:30.320
 Those are the good friend and very practical.

00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:33.320
 So, that is the good friends.

00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:38.320
 That is, that will do. It will increase our already good things.

00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:41.320
 It will glorify. It will repolite them.

00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:49.060
 It is like, as moonlight shines the white house, as building is already white, beautiful white

00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:49.320
 house,

00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:53.320
 when the moon shines in the evening or for more time.

00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:58.320
 It glorifies the beauty and the splendor of that color.

00:51:58.320 --> 00:52:03.320
 Similarly, the good friend, you already have the beautiful color.

00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:06.320
 You already have the Buddha nature. It is not something that we don't have.

00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:08.320
 We already have all those beautiful colors.

00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:16.830
 Now, it begins to sizzle, sizzling, sizzling, activating, glorifying, and then, really, it will

00:52:16.830 --> 00:52:18.320
 make the difference.

00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:23.320
 Back to you and to the others, your families, friends, everyone.

00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:27.320
 We become, or you become win-win situations.

00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:35.300
 You win, the others win, in the context of the joy and appreciation, and the wonderfuls and awes

00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:36.320
omes.

00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:38.320
 That really will come.

00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:43.320
 This is what contracting with the best friend.

00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:47.320
 And the best friend and the best teacher.

00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:55.320
 And what is this? This is, then again, is already translated here.

00:52:55.320 --> 00:52:57.320
 I will go here.

00:52:57.320 --> 00:53:08.320
 The win in the reliance and the somber, your defects, defects, win,

00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:15.320
 and your positive always grow like a waxing moon, to cherish such spiritual friend,

00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:22.320
 even more than your own body, is the practice of the bodhisattvas.

00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:28.320
 When you got this kind of friend, role models and examples or the teachers,

00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:33.320
 you should see as precious ones.

00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:37.320
 You should see it is important, it is special.

00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:45.320
 This is the friend that will support to you, lead to go to the beyond and for your goals.

00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:49.320
 Friend, good friends, he is spiritual friend.

00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:53.570
 The teachers in the Buddha teaching always mention good teacher is your spiritual friend, is

00:53:53.570 --> 00:53:55.320
 nothing else.

00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:58.320
 He is a friend. We are all friends.

00:53:58.320 --> 00:54:01.320
 We are all moving in that direction.

00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:07.320
 Good friend is like good captain, winning the passengers.

00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:09.320
 And we have good captain.

00:54:09.320 --> 00:54:15.320
 That captain will lead us to save and smooth and ride in a beautiful journey

00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:19.320
 and avoiding all the kind of like hinders and difficulties, troubles,

00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:23.320
 and every way to go to reach to the shoulders.

00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:27.320
 That is very special, special.

00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:30.320
 So what he does, he has said all these things.

00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:34.320
 So I won't go now and he said that when you contract, contract,

00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:39.320
 it will decrease and all the negative arrows started decreasing.

00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:45.320
 That means negative emotions, negative emotions, negative behaviors,

00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:54.320
 negative conductors, it will demolish, can't really go away, away, and all that.

00:54:54.320 --> 00:55:00.320
 When that happens, these are the negative, all that cover our beauties is thick cloud in the sky,

00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:02.320
 thick cloud in the sky covered up there.

00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:10.320
 When you start demolishing your petting wave, what is glorifying the beauty of the hidden gauntlet

00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:11.320
 of the skies,

00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:17.320
 sun and the moon and star, all in the blue sky, are really beginning to show up.

00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:25.320
 Clearly, clearly, clearly, and all the clouds, and all the good qualities are rising as like moons.

00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:27.320
 Everything is coming up.

00:55:27.320 --> 00:55:31.320
 That's what called known as advancing to the path and boomers.

00:55:31.320 --> 00:55:37.320
 Reaching enlightenment, coming every step kind of moves really, something rewarding, nice.

00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:41.320
 When you look back to your life, I did something good.

00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:47.320
 Standing on the present spot, looking back, I did good, I did good.

00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:51.320
 And looking to the forward, and also you have beautiful plans, beautiful goal,

00:55:51.320 --> 00:55:53.320
 I'm going to do something good.

00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:58.320
 So past is good, present is good, and future is good, all very good.

00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:03.320
 And for that reason, and part is good, nice love good.

00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:06.320
 And for that reason, the great Master Shandi Deva said,

00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:09.320
 "Have you ride the bodhicata horse?"

00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:14.320
 Horse, from now on, is always good.

00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:19.320
 From the good to good, even better, better, better.

00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:25.320
 That's what's called path of bodhisattva, path of joy and peace, enlightenment.

00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:28.320
 There is nothing kind of disturbed now.

00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:31.320
 You continue moving and everything.

00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:36.320
 And that is, when you find this, when you're friend like this,

00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:40.320
 then you should always cherish and respect and appreciate.

00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:45.320
 Even more dear than in here, even your bodhisattva.

00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:51.320
 But you should cherish and respect and kind of feel how I'm lucky,

00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:54.320
 how I'm fortunate that I have beautiful friend

00:56:54.320 --> 00:56:59.320
 that who can support and help, or have so many friends, similar, how I'm wonderful,

00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:05.320
 how beautiful, really recognize, enjoy, and be part of the team,

00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:07.320
 to get more power.

00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:11.320
 That is rewarding, and that is practice on the bodhisattvas.

00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:15.320
 From this on now, so that is really about this.

00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:21.320
 This stanza, from this first stanza of this, up to this point,

00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:27.320
 is all foundation of the practice of bodhisattvas, all the foundations.

00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:31.320
 When we have the beauty of this foundation and preparation, call it this,

00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:35.320
 then we begin to now practice, move forward.

00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:38.320
 Rest all, this then is the part of the practice.

00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:44.320
 But it's not just we practice this path, this past six stanzas at one point

00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:46.320
 and then kind of lead that.

00:57:46.320 --> 00:57:51.320
 This is continuing our supportive practice, the fulfillment of the bodhisattva practices,

00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:54.320
 so then we keep up continually.

00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:59.320
 And that is my brief talk today, and again, I thank to every of you.

00:57:59.320 --> 00:58:01.320
 Thank you, okay? Thank you, everyone.

00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:04.320
 Thank you so much, everyone, and thank you very much.

00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:10.320
 Wherever you are, wherever you may be, and wherever you're connected to here,

00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:16.320
 I'm so thankful, so grateful, hope it serves some of our practice and meditations,

00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:21.320
 and at least reminding of some of the teachings of the brothers.

00:58:21.320 --> 00:58:28.320
 So I'm grateful, grateful, and we don't see before our big holiday season.

00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:33.320
 I wish you a happy and healthy, beautiful, a lot of beautiful peace,

00:58:33.320 --> 00:58:36.320
 peace and realization to all of you and good health.

00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:42.320
 Thank you, thank you. And now we do again short dedication practices we have,

00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:50.320
 and I mean dedication practices, and then if you don't have these texts,

00:58:50.320 --> 00:58:55.320
 then those who are in different places do some dedication practices, you know.

00:58:55.320 --> 00:58:59.320
 Graduation is the best wishes, good wishes. We're wishing to everyone.

00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:01.320
 We started with this, with good motivation.

00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:05.320
 We kind of reflect the teaching of the Buddha with good motivation.

00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:08.320
 Now, we're concluding this practice with good motivation,

00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:13.320
 with good things to hold, where there's no more war, no more disturbance,

00:59:13.320 --> 00:59:17.320
 no more payments, no more suffering, the difficulties, no more violence.

00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:22.320
 There's so many peace and joy, and every one, great understanding,

00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:26.320
 really great understanding, realization, peace and harmony.

00:59:26.320 --> 00:59:31.320
 How is it important to bring the good things to everyone because of that,

00:59:31.320 --> 00:59:35.320
 and the heart is waking up to that understanding.

00:59:35.320 --> 00:59:41.320
 Really, we can pray by our deeds, so we do these dedication prayers.

01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:07.320
 And page seven, according to this booklet, page seven,

01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:11.320
 and I think whenever our Sangha members have this prayer,

01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:18.320
 same thing, maybe slightly different page, but so, and page eight, sorry, page eight.
