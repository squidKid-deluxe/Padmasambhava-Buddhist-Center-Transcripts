NOTE     "description": "On November 26, 2010 in Sravasti, India, Venerable Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche led a Buddha sadhana practice inside the PBC Miracle Stupa in Sravasti, India, where Venerable Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche's relics were installed on the shrine. The PBC Miracle Stupa is located a few minutes away from the the original place where Buddha Shakyamuni performed miracles for 15 days, bringing many beings to the Dharma. It is also very close to Jetavan Park, where Buddha spent around 24 years in retreat with the noble sangha.",
