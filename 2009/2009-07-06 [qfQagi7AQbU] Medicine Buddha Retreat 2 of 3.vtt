00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440
 Now a domino or the moon-like sutra or the samadhi, samadhi, radhi sutra, Mahayana text,

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:15.200
 said whoever think of the Buddha, Buddha, Buddha is right there, Buddha is right there, there and

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.360
 not

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:23.360
 just right there but Buddha will bless, Buddha will support all their practices, whoever think that

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:23.360
,

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:34.480
 the truth happened that, let don't take by or let don't take all power out by the doubt

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:41.040
 and hesitation, if we don't have that then again it will happen.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:02.560
 Buddha has no distances, Buddha has no distances, distances is conceptions, when you have this

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:08.000
 realization or when you have that confidence, Buddha is right there, Buddha is not just relying

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.200
 upon the kind of like, when you have the confidence, Buddha is not relying upon the

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.080
 different means to be connected to us, Buddha is right there, Buddha don't have to be

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:25.840
 dependent by the last quote, this travel agents, travel agents, all the transport agents,

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:33.440
 all the telephone lines, all the practices, any of that, motor, car, train, any of that,

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:40.000
 really it's always there, when you have that confidence, Buddha is right there, the Western mind,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:49.200
 Western realization is more, more faster, more quicker than even the modern technologies,

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.600
 colleges and that modern technology in a way really proves there is a way means to connect

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:02.560
 that that distance and all this is just only on the surface, surface but when you have that

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:09.520
 kind of like hidden realization, the confidence then we discover that, call it this and then

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.960
 there's no distance, there's no kind of these divisions making hundreds.
