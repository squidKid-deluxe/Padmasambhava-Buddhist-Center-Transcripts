00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160
 And what were the important teachings? What's called novel truth teachings?

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:11.230
 The novel truth teachings are nothing but teachings of the cause and condition, and it is the

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:12.800
 effect or the result.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:19.200
 Or in other words, the teachings of the intelligent owner, ordination, everything is dependent on

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.480
 the cause and condition and the result.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.760
 There's nothing one single result comes without the cause and condition. That's what really makes

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.520
 it meaningful.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:28.960
 That was the teachings.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.360
 When I was a kid, there was no reason for it to happen.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.800
 There was no reason for it to happen, but there was no reason for it to happen.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.600
 There was no reason for it to happen, but there was no reason for it to happen.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.800
 There was no reason for it to happen.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.800
 There was no reason for it to happen.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.800
 There was no reason for it to happen.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.920
 There was no reason for it to happen, but there was no reason for it to happen.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.920
 There was no reason for it to happen.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.920
 There was no reason for it to happen.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.920
 There was no reason for it to happen.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.920
 There was no reason for it to happen.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.920
 There was no reason for it to happen.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.920
 There was no reason for it to happen.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.920
 There was no reason for it to happen.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.920
 There was no reason for it to happen.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.920
 There was no reason for it to happen.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.920
 There was no reason for it to happen.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.920
 There was no reason for it to happen.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.920
 There was no reason for it to happen.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.920
 There was no reason for it to happen.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.920
 There was no reason for it to happen.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.920
 There was no reason for it to happen.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.920
 There was no reason for it to happen.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.920
 There was no reason for it to happen.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.920
 There was no reason for it to happen.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.920
 There was no reason for it to happen.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.920
 There was no reason for it to happen.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.920
 There was no reason for it to happen.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.920
 There was no reason for it to happen.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.920
 There was no reason for it to happen.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.920
 There was no reason for it to happen.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.920
 It is also dependent on its own cause.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.920
 It's not just that it happened.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.920
 One cause will do anything bad.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.920
 But it's completely dependent upon its own.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.920
 The result is dependent upon its own cause.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.920
 So in other words, the cause and the result are never going to be mixed up.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.920
 Or they're going to change or to let it change.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.920
 It's exactly going to happen as the cause is.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.920
 So as a result, for example, rice seed will bring rice.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:30.920
 Rice seed, seed of rice, will not bring the grain of the barley or the vanilla.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.920
 It just remains as excited as it is.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:40.920
 Even we're expecting, plant the rice and expecting the barley.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.920
 We like to have rice sambal according to Britain.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.920
 Sambal is very popular, but you can't have sambal from the rice.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.920
 In Italy, when we came up, we used to make rice sambal.
