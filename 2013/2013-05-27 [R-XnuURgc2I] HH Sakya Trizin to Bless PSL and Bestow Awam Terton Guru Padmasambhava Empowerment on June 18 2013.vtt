00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 "His Holiness the 41st Sakya Trizin, the supreme head of the Sakya school of Tibetan Buddhism,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.840
 and who is in this country in the New York State, and he kindly accepted our invitation

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:34.840
 to come between his busy schedules, so he said he will come on June 18th, which I think holds

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:44.840
 in the 10th day, the Tuesday, so he's really coming here, blessing us and give some teachings,

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:51.090
 and that we're going to have the kosti, because he's going to accept us, so we got this

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.840
 confirmation,

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.840
 I think last night, so they have to discuss, but he's really going to come here and bless,

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.840
 as he said, His Holiness is one of the greatest teachers, living greatest teachers now,

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:12.840
 and he is the head of the Sakya schools of Tibetan Buddhism, and as we discuss, and you all know,

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.840
 in Tibetan there are four big Buddhist schools, among the four, and the Sakya is one,

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:28.840
 and the Sakya is the, His Holiness is the head of the Sakya school, and also he belongs to the

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.840
 family of the Sakya, in Tibetan Buddhism, or generally Buddhism, family is not really important,

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:41.840
 but however, the Sakya family is considering very special family, family in the Tibetan Buddhism

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:49.840
 is the divine family, and all the great pondering Sakya masters was born in that family,

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.840
 family at the 11th century and with 10th century, one of the earliest, I mean of course,

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.840
 long line clients of the family, one of the family members was the first Tibetan Buddhist

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:07.840
 monk, one of the seven testimonies in the Buddhist, when Buddhists came to the Tibetan

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.840
 in the Tongan, Burupa, Masambhava, Greermas, Chanda Rakhtai, and King Chasun Dibni,

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:22.840
 and when came, after Sami monastery is completed, and that Tibetan popo can keep the Vanaya

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:30.840
 vows or not, they're going to test seven, the Portland little beings, and among the seven,

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.840
 the Chanda like to give the vows to all those seven monks, and one of that is, the family

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.840
 belongs to the Sakya school, Sakya family, that which is his own Sakya visit family,

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:49.840
 it's called, very known, it was a disciple of Burupa, Masambhava, Chanda Rakhtai,

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:57.840
 and so first the seven testimonies, and then here, here his own Sakya, which is born in

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:04.840
 the Tibetan 1945 in the ancient lineage of the Kong, he is regarded as emanation of

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.840
 the Buddha Manjushri, he is a highly-related master, with profound wisdom and limitless

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.840
 compassion, as holder of the Sakya throne, his wholeness has been tirelessly working

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.840
 for the benefit of all sentient beings, the Sakya tradition, the Buddhism in general,

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.840
 he was, he has built and renovated the monasteries, none of the schools, and relatives

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.840
 for the Tibetan refugees, and has established over 30 monasteries in Nepal, India, and

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:39.840
 support and establishment of numerous Sakya centers all over the world, his wholeness

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.840
 often traveled around the world, teaching Dharma and advanced meditation authentic

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:57.840
 and performed, teaching according to the needs of his disciples, and then, he didn't

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:04.840
 mention it, but he is the one of the first great teachers who spoke the English, really

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:12.840
 didn't mention it, but he was, when I was in India in 1970, everybody going to start

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:20.840
 whispering, he always speaks English, he speaks English, and they start talking really,

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:27.840
 so he is the, that time many teachers don't speak English, and they don't think his

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.840
 Holy Dalai Lama speaks English well that time, but his wholeness, Sakya Cunzi, is the

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:40.840
 first, one of the first, who spoke the English, okay, thank you, thank you, everyone.
