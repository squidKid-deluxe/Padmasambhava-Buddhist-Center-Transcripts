00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.640
 So we are highly instant person, instant Dzogchen practitioners, and that is like when the time is

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:13.600
 in participating status, teacher, and there, in this moment there's so much space, immediately it's

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:20.500
 catch, catch as the grass fires, the bush fires, instantly realization, instantly boost up.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.390
 And that happened so many times, for example, not just in the Vedayana schools of the Buddhism's,

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:31.820
 but also in the Theravada or in the Yayana's Buddhism, for example at the beginning of the when the

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:38.500
 Buddha started giving the teachings, all those like private disciples of the Buddha's are also,

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.000
 they are instant, highly accomplished practitioners.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.410
 The immediate learning moment after they visit the Four Noble Truths Teaching, they become the Arh

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:53.290
athas. Yes, like very soon, that they didn't have long to practice, moment the Buddha turns three

00:00:53.290 --> 00:01:00.530
 times, three times this the Four Noble Truths Teaching, after that session, when the session is

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.000
 ended, these five of them reach the Arhathas instant.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.800
 And then such as the Hary potter and Mughal potters, they are also very good, that, and moment

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.570
 again, they saw, for example, one of the disciples of the Buddha, which is one of the five

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.000
 disciples of the Buddha, known as Tathar.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.740
 The moment that Hary potter saw Tathar, immediately he got, he got, what's it called, he got, what

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:31.000
 they call it, goosebumps, he got goosebumps, he got goosebumps, he fit so much power.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.290
 Spent, who is this, this, that? I mean, there's a long, kind of a, large, beautiful story, but

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:44.060
 anyway, finally I understand this, Tathar told that he is the disciple of the Buddha, and moment he

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.000
 had Buddha, again, it burst out, and he's so eager to see the Buddha.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:59.230
 And when Hary potter began to come in toward the Buddha, and the Buddha mentioned, "Come soon, come

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:04.000
 soon, come to me, come to me, come to me."

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.810
 When moment he said that, that world, world, Hary potter had become unhappened. Immediately, that,

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:17.620
 that, Hary potter is already gathered, very highly intelligent, highly, very educated person, Bra

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.800
hma, high caste Brahma, even the Brahma, he is one of the highest Brahma schools, and he got

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.000
 immediate.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.800
 And similarly, Mongol potters, when Mongol potter repeated what he learned from Tathar and Buddha,

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.000
 in that moment, Mongol potter becomes unhappened.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:43.420
 And of course, Mahakahyapa, Mahakahyapa also, when Buddha, moment like Mahakahyapa saw Buddha, "Oh,

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.000
 you're my teacher," and Buddha said, "Yes, I am your teacher, come."

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:56.860
 And that world, completely, Mahakahyapa becomes unhappened. They didn't have to go through all the

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.000
 different things.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.230
 They all have, there's so many beautiful, like, stories. It's just, last time, one after another,

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:10.000
 it really just ignited every status, all that, and that's how those are capabilities.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.020
 And then in Vaidyana school, always mentioned, such a great thing in there, Buddhism, is one of the

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.000
 very high-coupledness Brahma schools.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.830
 And then this great Master Chukudu said also, "Saraa." Real Master Saraa is also a high-coupledness

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.000
 Brahma school.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.700
 And in Tibet, there's very few most, like, I do school master, known as Lingyileva. He said, "Lingy

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.000
ileva is also a high-coupledness Brahma school."

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 I'm instant that, he catch up that.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 And also Lingyileva is the sponsor of the Dukpataji school. And he, in a great master's mention,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 that he is instant reliters.
