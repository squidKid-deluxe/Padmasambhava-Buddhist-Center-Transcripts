00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 I would like to say a good morning, everyone. Good morning and welcome everyone. Thank you. Thank

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 you. Welcome.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 And as you all know, this morning I am going to offer the empowerment of the Vajrapani, Vajrapani.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.940
 And in order to do empowerment, and always it is part of the ceremony or the empowerment, give

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.000
 introductions.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 And then do the involvement. So the first I am going to give brief introductions.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:59.750
 Then the Vajrapani, who is Vajrapani, what is the, where this teaching comes from, and then what is

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.000
, what means in our room.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 So those are the three subdivisions that I will go over these introductions.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:19.200
 The first is this, who is Vajrapani? Vajrapani is simple to tell. Vajrapani is Buddha, totally

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.000
 enlightened.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:29.230
 Vajrapani appeared in many different forms because when you reach the Buddha, or when you become

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:30.000
 the Buddha,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 what is the purpose of becoming Buddha in Mahayana teaching?

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.230
 In Mahayana teaching, the principle purpose of becoming Buddha is to benefit, to help, to support

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.000
 to all living beings.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 So that is really fundamental goal, goal of becoming enlightenment.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 Dear God, becoming enlightenment wants all purpose, become enlightenment for the purpose of others.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.850
 And for that reason, Vajrapani is totally enlightened beings, but yet Vajrapani appeared in many

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.000
 different forms in order to benefit for all beings.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 Vajrapani appeared in one of the also great Bodhisattvas.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 Among at Bodhisattvas, Vajrapani is known as at one of the great Bodhisattvas, Vajrapani.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:32.450
 Then Vajrapani is appeared also in the Buddha teaching at our center, known as Vedic Chetaka, or D

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:41.000
urya Number Nyumbak, very famous cleansing purification Buddha, known as Durya Number Nyumbak.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 In it appeared in Sanskrit, Vedic Chetaka. That is very famous Durya Number Nyumbak.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.850
 Then Vajrapani appeared in the form of again the principle deity of the inner anthems, known as Vaj

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.000
rasattvas.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 So Vajrasattva as Vajrapani appeared in the form of the Vajrasattva.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 Again Vajrasattva is known as the principle Buddha of all the Buddhas.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:18.940
 Even in the teaching said, Vajrasattva is embodied in all Buddhas that we can encompass entirely

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.000
 Buddhas, one hundred Buddhas.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.690
 For example, one hundred Buddha, peaceful rather Buddhas can be summarized into five dhyana Buddhas

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:28.000
.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.480
 That five dhyana Buddha can be summarized in one Buddha or come down to the one Buddha as Vajrasatt

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.000
vas.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 So this Vajrasattva is lord and the principle mandala of the entirely, the all the inanatas.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 Then Vajrasattva appeared in the form of the Rata deities, very Rata deities.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 Then Vajrapani, known as Vedic Chellayas, also Vedic Chellayas, very rapid.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 At that time, Vedic Chellayas, Vedic Chellayas, Vedic Chellayas,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:10.350
 represent the entire action of the all the Buddhas, the entire action of the Buddhas, the activity

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.000
 of the Buddhas.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 So Vajrapani is again a Buddha, ultimate state of the Rata deities.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:24.570
 Rata is not just an angel, a form of kenghini, by the power of compassion, expressing to benefit to

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.000
 all the beings.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:36.300
 For the power of compassion a big form of wrath, wrath to remove and to cleanse and purify and

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.000
 destroy,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 destroying the very difficult to show you, such as ego cleanse.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 And that is Vedic Bhanis.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 So therefore, many of them.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 And then Vedic Bhanis is very high, almost very Vedic.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 Vedic Bhanis is no other than the Buddha, some of the Buddhas.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 So therefore, Vedic Bhanis are very, very special Buddhas.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 Also Vedic Bhanis are known as the three, among three Buddhas.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 Known as, such as, Manjushri, Jairasa or Awalokiteshara, and Vedic Bhanis.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 Those are the three principal Bodhisattvas, or even many times they have three Buddhas.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 At that time, for example, Manjushri represented all, embodiment all enlightenment Buddhas.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 Bodhi of the old enlightened Buddhas.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 And Awalokiteshara represented, or Jairasa represented all the speech of the Buddhas.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 And Vedic Bhanis represented all the western mind or the power of the old Buddhas.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 And therefore, again, known as the three Buddhas of three families.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 Bodhi, speech and mind.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 Bodhi Buddha, Manjushri, speech Buddha, Awalokiteshara,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 and the western mind of the Vedic Bhanis.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 So Vedic Bhanis are very pervasive and very essential Buddhas of the generally Mahayana teachings,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 and particularly in the outer tenderer, in the tenderers.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 And then Vedic Bhanis also appeared from the disciple of the Vadakshatamunus.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 Many times, even Mahayana teachings.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 So the Mahayana teachings mentioned that Vedic Bhanis always appeared,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 appeared as disciple and bodyguard of the Vadakshatamunus.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 There is also the three stories.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 Once upon a time when the Buddha was residing in the Vadakshatamunus,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 and the king of that country, the Vadakshatamunus, known as Adyachathara.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 or in its very full, known as Mathida.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 Mathida was influenced by Devadatta.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 Devadatta is always very challenging to the Buddha, or contentious.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 Contentious?

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 Contentious to the Buddha, even when he was young, or when they were young.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
 Devadatta was also born as the same kind in the family.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 He was always wanting to be challenged with the Buddha.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 But however, Buddha become the spirit, even the youthful state,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 before he became the Buddha.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 So he couldn't really challenge.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 But ever since, he did not give up his contagious, that mental attitude, never.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 So when Buddha become as a great teacher, as enlightened beings,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 teacher of so many beings, but also he like to challenge,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.000
 he become as also as like practitioners, but not following the Buddha's.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 Since he is already royal connected, or royal kind of born, Devadatta was born,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 so he become very friend of the king Adyachathara.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 Adyachathara, and he influenced him.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 Adyachathara and Devadatta both decided they are going to kill the Buddha.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 If they kill the Buddha, then he will become, Devadatta will become the less superior teacher.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 And Adyachathara will be supported and guided by the Devadatta.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 They become really a very good friend.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 So they are trying to kill the Buddha.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 And when the teaching said that one time they throw the big boulder,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000
 big boulder as like canopy, can be thrown to the top of the Buddha

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 where the Buddha is residing in Watcher's Creek Mountains.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 So he threw his ancient technique as like a big boulder, as like bone,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 like shooting, shooting throw that back.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 But with that big boulder, when he throw it to all the Buddha to kill the Buddha,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 they accidentally in the teaching said, "Vedya Bani, throw his vedya."

00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:01.000
 So with that vedya, the boulder becomes smothered in the air as like what they called here,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
 modern time, like tama-hak missile.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
 When somebody shooting, they throw it out and kill.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 So the vedya bani, the hand of the vedya,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 played as tama-hak missiles and destroyed in the air.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 That's the really teaching said.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 So when the teaching said always,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
 "Vedya Bani is behind the Buddha many times as a body product."

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 Many of those are others as the disciple sees.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 One is very kind of thirsty, strong, dark, main step, like macho,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
 looking behind, always the Buddha.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 And many disciples asked, "Who is this?"

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 And they said, "This is the most powerful Buddha of that."

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
 Even Buddha himself said, "I cannot challenge this Buddha."

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 "I cannot glorify power and dignity and achievement of the vedya bani."

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 That's what Buddha said.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 So this is the vedya bani.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
 And this is what really vedya bani.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 Since the vedya bani is so special Buddhist,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 the greatest kindness, completion of the teacher,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 Buddha Shakyamuni gives variety of teachings of the vedya bani

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
 in the outer tantra, in the inner tantras.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000
 He gives so many teachings, outer inner tantras, teachings.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 And then all this teaching, every teaching, as you all know,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000
 came to Tibet, Tibet in the third century,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 in the time of Guru M. Sambhava,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000
 great Master Chantalakata, and great painters on deputies,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
 his courage and commitment.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 He organized an engine to bring the entire Buddha teachings.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 Buddha teachings are not just teaching along the scripture,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 only the kind of academic, but the realization that really He established.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000
 Therefore, in the Tibetan culture, longer than that, top than that,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 longer than that means the teaching of the scripture

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000
 that completely established in Tibet at that time.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 The pram, the basic Buddhist school teachings,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:15.000
 or the post-Buddha teachings, all the way to the Ayoua teaching,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 the academic, the sequential, Vinaya, Sutra, Abhidharma, Tantra,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
 that we're reading in the English, everything's isolated.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 And it's so precise and so perfect and so beautiful

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 that nothing can be changed in upper,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
 but nobody can need to correct.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 There's nothing more better to be isolated than that.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 That's not how they're isolated, beautiful.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:45.000
 The genius, the skilled persons, the emanated, the skilled beings appeared,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000
 time of the Astar's letter and the great masters of India and other countries,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
 cooperation through the corporate and the Astar's letter, everything.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 But not just only that, the thing called taupatin.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 The realization, the meaning of that,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 not just the academic level on the brain, kind of hovering in the brain,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 they observed that teaching, the meaning into the heart

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 and boosted their realization, exactly as the great teacher, Buddha, explained.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.000
 What he explained, every living being inherited, the Buddha nature.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
 It's just the only question whether you work for that or not.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 So these individuals have worked for that as they received teaching

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 and guided by those great masters, authentic, qualified masters,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000
 practiced the joyful effort, courage and commitment with devotion.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000
 They truly actualized what the teaching said

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000
 and boomed up their inner qualities, qualities.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000
 And then what are those narratives? 25 disciples, everyone.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
 And 35 great nappas.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:00.000
 And 27 of 25 great pima dakinis, or pima disciple.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 So many people, really men and women,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000
 get high realization of the human consciousness can achieve.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
 They achieved all that.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 Because they've been helped, they received, as a transcendental,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 what's the name of the body.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
 That is known as taupatimba.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 Not just only the sequential, academic, and saying systems existing,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000
 but the meaning that sizzling in the heart and the really guiding mind.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 So therefore, at that time, at the end of the century,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 the entire Buddha's teachings of the long dhamba and taupatimba,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 all the doctrine of the scripture and the doctrines of the realization,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
 that all burst out there.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 At that time, then this teaching came.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
 The Vaidyabhani teaching came in Tibet.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 Tibet.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:03.000
 And the great Master Chantaraki teaching, so many, as well as Mamanamathras.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000
 Chantaraki is known as also an emanation of the Vaidyabhani's.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 And in the teaching always, at that time,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 the Chantaraki, Chantaraki, three Buddha come through there,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 one time and one second, and at the same time,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000
 the Chantaraki established the authentic teaching of the Buddha Chantaraki,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000
 best upon the non-volence, peace, harmony, respect, appreciation,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
 every living beings.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
 That was established.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 Who are those three Buddhas?

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 Always said that, "Gurubhema Samvavai is the emanation of the Kireyasav,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 Awalokudihara, or the Amitabha."

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:48.000
 And Vahitavakkadai is the emanation of the Vaidyabhani.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 And the Kireyasav is the emanation of the medushi.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 So there are three great, three Bodhisattvas came.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
 Bodhisattva and Mahasattvas.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
 Bodhisattva also has around two kinds of Mahas, Bodhisattva.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 And let me show it to you.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 You saw those, and really, we joined the heart of Mahasattvas.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 For example, when we referred to Awalokudihara in the teaching,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 always said, "Bodhisattva, Mahasattvas."

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 It's not just the Bodhisattva, Mahasattvas.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 That means, one who is closely enlightened, close to the Buddha.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000
 For example, ten Bodhisattvas, ten Bodhisattvas,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
 first Bodhi, second Bodhi, third Bodhi.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 Those old books are known as Bodhisattvas.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000
 Even when you develop the Bodhisattva truly in your heart and mind,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 it will even take a while.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 They are called as Bodhisattvas.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 But they are not Mahasattvas.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
 Their achievement is not Mahasattvas.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 And who achieved Mahasattva?

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
 Mahasattva, they are the language.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
 At Bumi, 9th Bumi, 10th Bumi Bodhisattva,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 named as Mahasattvas.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 Bodhisattva, Mahasattva.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:06.000
 So these three Bodhisattvas, Manjushili, Awalokudihara,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
 and Vaidya Vanya are the Bodhisattva of Mahasattvas.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
 So these three Bodhisattva, great Bodhisattva,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 came to debate in order to establish a peaceful teaching,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000
 peaceful messages in that country.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 And that for that reason,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
 the emanation of the Vaidya Vanya is the GURUPYA MASANBHA.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
 Emination of the Vaidya Vanya is the CHANDA RATUVA.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 Emination of the Manjushili is the Vaid.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
 Those are known as the three books.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 So that established.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.000
 And particularly, GURUPYA MASANBHA, CHANDA RATUVA gave a lot of teachings

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
 on the Vaidya Vanyas.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
 Awalokudihara and Enandandara.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:57.000
 Enandandara, this Vaidya Vanya is connected with the adhirukha teachings.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 And that was GURUPYA MASANBHA.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
 Why did that teach?

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000
 So from ever since, this teaching of the practice of the Vaidya Vanya

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:12.000
 has become very popular practices in Tibet, all schools of Tibet Buddhism, ever since.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 And so that is really how, who is Vaidya Vanya?

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
 Vanya, how this teaching came from him.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 This is a very teaching of the Buddha Shakyamuni

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000
 and that continuity to Vaidya Vanya.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:33.000
 And then particularly this teaching, what we call in Vaidya Vanya teaching,

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
 or empowerment, you are going to see.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 This course belongs to the Yuma schools of Tibet Buddhism.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 Yuma, again, we always took this part of the lineage,

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 part of the gratitude.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 A member of the kindness of all those great practitioners, masters,

00:17:52.000 --> 00:18:00.000
 who transmitted this teaching as gratitude, we talk.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 So this belongs to the Yuma teachers.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000
 Yuma teaching is started at the century, until now.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000
 This teaching is transmitted by, transmitted through two systems,

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000
 known as Gama and Thermas.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000
 Gama is the origin lineage, time of Vibhava Masanbha.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
 Therma is later lineage.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 Both lineage, these teachings are best upon Buddha teaching or the Gama teachings.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 Gama is the best on the Buddha teaching.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000
 Therma is the best on the Gama, Buddha teaching.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000
 But Therma is the best on the Gama teaching, which is Buddha teaching.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
 Buddha Shakyamuni is teaching.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000
 And that continues.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000
 So through the two lineages, are maintained,

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
 are kept, this lineage teaching,

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.000
 exactly as it transmitted by the Buddha Shakyamuni,

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 Gama Masanbha, Great Master Shinta Rakkana.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:00.000
 They are really, entirely kept by their devotion, by their courage and commitment.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:06.000
 Nobody played any kind of intellectual games in the lineage systems.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 They are kept exactly as it is.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000
 As it started to play, as it distilled the water,

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 it distilled clay and distilled water, as water, the clean water,

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.000
 that will remove thirsty and difficulties of everyone

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000
 and keep the regiments and keep the lives.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
 That is how this lineage.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.000
 And particularly this lineage is then taught by the Great Master.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000
 Master known as Mohanobotyas.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.000
 Mohanobotyas is one of the great masters in the historian of the Tibetan Buddhism

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 or the indigenous Buddhism.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 He is one of the very great masters, truly masters.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:57.000
 And he was scholar, hermitage, monk, and loki,

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000
 as simple hermitage.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 Even though he became one of the great masters during that time,

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.000
 but he just stayed so humble, so simple, drawn to the earth.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000
 He stayed on the caves, mountains, and hermitages.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 That is what the great master Mohanobotyas was.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.000
 And radiating his vow of love and the compassion of wisdom in every direction.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000
 And he is activated by that with so many disciples

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000
 and reaching so many beings, enlightened,

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000
 both at the lateral level and the relational level.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 So this teaching is the teaching by the Mohanobotyas.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:43.000
 It is a combination of the essence of the kamai and the dharma teachings.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 In Mohanobotyas' studies, I convinced both kamai and dharma teachings

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 as a single, short, simple practice of the Vedya Upanish.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.000
 So that is the one.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:58.000
 And so this teaching then has become very popular practices of the new ones.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000
 And as well as the Gaju schools of Tibetan Buddhism, too.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
 And beautiful practices.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000
 And I received this teaching from the great master,

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:13.000
 my beloved brother, and let that not teach or let catch in particular.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000
 I received this teaching.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000
 As I received, I'm offering you this empowerment.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000
 So that's how the lineage of this teaching is.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000
 Now I talk really about empowerment, breathing.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 Again, you all know you're receiving empowerment.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000
 Many of you know the meaning of the empowerment.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000
 But again, I talk as part of the lineage.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000
 And my post now, what means empowerment?

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 Empowerment has two things, cause and condition.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
 The cause and condition.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:52.000
 And when the cause and condition combine, then you receive the empowerment.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000
 You receive the empowerment.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.000
 And when the cause and the condition perfectly catch together as harmonized,

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000
 then what it does?

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:06.000
 It makes change. It blooms slower, or resolve whatever that is.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 So now, what is the cause of enlightenment, or sorry, empowerment?

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.000
 Cause of empowerment is each of our own potential.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.000
 Our own ordinary nature of the mind, potential.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000
 This is what Buddha Kshaktamuni named, the Ogratius teacher,

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000
 Buddha Kshaktamuni named, Buddha Nature.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000
 We all have the Buddha Nature.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000
 And no one is absent of the Buddha Nature, anyone.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000
 Everyone has Buddha Nature.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:38.000
 You have Buddha Nature, I have Buddha Nature, everyone has Buddha Nature.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000
 And this Buddha Nature is the cause of the enlightenment.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000
 Or cause of enlightenment, also cause of the empowerment.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000
 Because of that, you receive the empowerment.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 And how is this Buddha Nature is?

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 Again, that was the gracious teacher, Buddha Kshaktamuni, explained.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 Many teachings in Mahayana, particularly this teaching,

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000
 which is explained very bitterly of the Buddha Nature,

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000
 is known as third turning wheel of dharma.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000
 But I cannot give teaching about this on the post,

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.000
 this turning wheel of dharma, and nor in the second turning wheel of dharma.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:23.000
 But he gave this teaching so detailed, precisely in third turning wheel of dharma,

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.000
 and as well as then in the Mahayana teachings.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000
 And how this Buddha Nature is?

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.000
 That is a great master or great teacher, Buddha Kshaktamuni said,

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000
 it is Samadhi Raji Sutras, known as Samadhi Raji Sutra,

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.000
 in the Tibetan it is known as Tingyin-zi Yapung-do.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000
 In that teaching he said,

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:53.000
 clear, pure, undisturbed, uncombounded, and cannot be disturbed.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000
 That is Buddha Nature.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 Dharma, dharma, you must say, luminous, clear light.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:07.000
 Clear light, luminous, undisturbed, uncheckable, pure.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 And clean, that is the Buddha Nature.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.000
 It is unconformed.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000
 That is our Buddha Nature.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:24.000
 That is residing right now with us, ourselves.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:30.000
 This is also known as, it is not just newly arrived,

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:36.000
 it is a continuation from the beginner's time after now.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000
 That is what it is.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000
 But present time, our Buddha Nature is

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:47.000
 cobbled by many diluted, diluted conceptions,

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 or diluted films, diluted and diluted conceptions.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000
 Those are known as Obscurations.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000
 Obscurations block that.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000
 Who did that Obscurations?

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000
 Who diluted, who diluted?

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.000
 Nobody else by one's own self, one's own self-depth.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:14.000
 So these Obscurations are a creation of our own, our self.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.000
 And so therefore, in empowerment, when you receive,

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:26.000
 it will begin to cleanse, purify that delusions.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000
 Delusions.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000
 Empowerment is like conditions.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000
 When cause is there, there cause is there,

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000
 if you have the perfect conditions, then it begins to change.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000
 That is the common knowledge that everybody knows.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:49.000
 If you have the perfect seed, clean, unaffected seed,

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000
 what we need now?

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.000
 If we like to grow something, we have to have the beautiful conditions.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.000
 Perfect soil, perfect temperature, perfect cooking cake,

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:07.000
 perfect warmness, and then what it comes?

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:13.000
 The result, the fruit, even bloom, there is no need to be dull.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000
 No need to be kind of thinking, is it going to happen or not happen?

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000
 It is going to happen.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 Because cause is the perfect, and conditions are perfect,

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000
 perfectly applied, and that will bring the result.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000
 This is not just a miracle, or somebody can't get stage and things to happen.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:35.000
 It is truly the law of the systems.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:40.000
 The law and the rule of the interdependent co-ordinations.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 That will improve us.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000
 So this empowerment is like conditions.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.000
 It is a condition when they apply to this,

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.000
 then people begin to bring the result.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000
 So that is how really empowerment.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:59.000
 Therefore, empowerment in Sanskrit is known as abhi sheka.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:04.000
 Abhi sheka is a translate in Tibet as pouring and dispelling.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.000
 Pouring and dispelling.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000
 Pouring and dispelling.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:16.000
 Pouring as P-U-R-I, I think, R-I-N-G, pouring, I believe.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.000
 Pouring and dispelling.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000
 What means pouring?

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:26.000
 The authentic lineage and techniques are pouring

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000
 in our mind, the streams of the Buddha nature.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.000
 Nature.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000
 And what is dispelling?

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000
 Dispelling that moment.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.000
 Moment, all the conceptions,

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000
 diluted, obscured, dispelling.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000
 Pilling them.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.000
 Then what will happen?

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:50.000
 Happening the window of light, of the origin of the Buddha nature,

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.000
 of the origin of the Buddha window of the light.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:58.000
 For example, midst of the dark, heavy cloud sky,

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.000
 if there is something going to happen, the weak send,

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000
 for a short time, short term for the window of the blue sky.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000
 That happens.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.000
 Then what we have to do?

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.000
 One view opens that.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000
 We have to keep continuing.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000
 Keep that maintaining.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.000
 That is known as practicing.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.000
 Keep continuing.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.000
 Then that is the window of our enlightenment,

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.000
 of the Buddha nature.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000
 It becomes wider, stronger, calmer,

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:30.000
 and the midst of cloud are getting way, way, way.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000
 And that means the complete reward

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000
 of the origin of the natural exile as it is,

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000
 that is known as enlightenment.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000
 In the process of that cleansing, purification,

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.000
 what is known is following the path.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.000
 Path.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000
 You are going through the path

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000
 and you are going through the bhoomis.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000
 So that is what is meaning of this empowerment,

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000
 really, about that.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000
 And then our empowerment, that involvement,

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000
 what is that?

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.000
 This involvement you are receiving through the meditation,

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000
 through the linear blessings,

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 through the mandala, and through the ritual objects.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.000
 These four combinations, you are receiving empowerment.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.000
 That is like conditions, receiving them.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:21.000
 So that is my brief introductions of the empowerment.
