00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:25.500
 So, I'm going to jump right in. Is that okay?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 That's okay?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 Go for it.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 Okay.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:21.220
 We can only be pretend Buddhists for so long.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:50.080
 I thought I'd be able to talk about responsibility.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:02:14.740
 So, the thing about going in the deep end is you actually have to let yourself go in the

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:40.100
 deep end.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:47.100
 And that's how we get free.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:58.700
 The dhamma is so deep and it's so, it's so kind.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:13.900
 The nature is so kind. Tara is so kind. Our teachers are so kind.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:32.380
 They're not going to force us to do anything. They're going to say, "Here's the next step.

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:42.300
 The big door." And it's completely up to us to keep going. And that's what a healthy

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:48.900
 lineage does. And that's what a healthy teacher-student relationship empowers. And that's who our

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:49.180
 kind

00:03:49.180 --> 00:04:08.940
 of teachers are. We have everything. We don't need all of interdependence to understand

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:23.460
 interdependence. We need a clear, reliable way to take the next step, to just let Tara

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:37.300
 be Tara. Let ourselves be ourselves. Let the nature do what the nature does. And it's totally

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:48.300
 up to us. It is totally up to us. And it's always been like that. And maybe this time,

00:04:48.300 --> 00:05:02.040
 maybe this time, we can really bravely, beautifully, powerfully, humbly, really let ourselves m

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.340
ingle

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:11.380
 with the Dharma. What power, what bravery, you know. Receive the blessings and let the

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:17.420
 blessings do what the blessings do. Let Tara do what Tara does. Let our nature do what our

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:33.620
 nature does and just let it happen. I've remembered so many times Diane. Let go. You ever been

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:49.100
 in a Shrivasana session? Okay. I got limber. I got loose. Now I just get to be with what opened. So

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:55.820
 the moment of death is like that, except it's not curated by a lovely, loving, supportive,

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:02.780
 nurtured, pretty music, good posture, everyone around the exact way we want it. It's not going

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.940
 to happen for almost any of us like that. It's just not how it actually happens for

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:15.580
 people usually. It's just not like that. Why? Because we just don't get to control it. It's

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:21.700
 the moment that we just don't get to control. At that point, we don't get to tell Tara what to do.

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:32.740
 We got to give it up. And if we want to see what that's like, we get the chance to see that every

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:39.620
 single day. And we can do it really practically, really practically. Okay. I mean, we can do it

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:52.420
 today. We can do it tomorrow. So what's a practical way? Sit on your cushion. Put your timer on on

00:06:52.420 --> 00:07:06.820
 your phone in the other room. Set it for one hour. Start. And for that hour, don't move.

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:22.140
 Don't scratch. Try not to blink. Don't wiggle. Don't stretch. Don't play. Don't open. Don't

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:34.740
 move. One hour. And we'll get to see how much we want to control Tara. We'll just see. It's a very

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:41.500
 practical, grounded, direct thing like, okay, when we're dying, and things are kind of like wobbly,

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.260
 and wiggly, and hot, and...
