00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 There are again numerous explanations but summarised by the great master known as Shanti Deva.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 No, not Shanti Deva. Aryadeva, Aryadeva, is foremost a disciple of the Nargiluna.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 Anybody said, they said three and then two more, and five qualities.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 First is, again I will list it and then of course you will know that too.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 First is, is no partialities, no partiality or no bias, bias, no biases.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 And smart or intelligent, smart and keen interested, keen interested, keen interested.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 And so that is three. Three is really important according to the teachings.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:13.180
 If you don't have that, even you met the qualified teacher, not going to see qualified teacher as

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.000
 qualified,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 and see the wrong things. So it's not going to go.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 Beside that two more, respect the folks, respect the folks, and pay a very attentive listening.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 These five are the five qualities of the disciples or the students.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 So this is what the teaching says. Qualified teacher, qualified students.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:55.250
 Then, this is again of course always in the teaching said, I'm sure you read so many books, there

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.000
 are so many books, proposed to be expert to find qualified teacher.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.170
 And the second one you find a qualified teacher and to be expert how to communicate contact with

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.000
 qualified teacher.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:20.280
 And the third is in the teaching said, be expert to be expert and be practical to learn the

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:28.000
 knowledge and the teaching and gain the kind of intention of the qualified teacher.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:36.040
 If you do that, then you'll be able to become a very perfect practitioner and a part of the lineage

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.000
 for you.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 So those are the teachings. That is the other approach.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.360
 And then many times, also of course, you read too, there's many times, there's not really examples

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.000
 of those qualified days and days.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.760
 For example, all those 25 disciples in the Guru Pima Sambha, they did not examine the Guru Pima Sam

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.000
bha or the Master Chaita Rakita.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 By seeing, by receiving the teaching, immediately they observed that they are just highly ready,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 highly qualified and they got enlightened within their lifetime.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 They arrived. And they read the largest story of the Mala Reva, great master Mala Reva.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 When he met Marva, Marva, he did an exam, he did that. Even Marva did all those harsh things.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:25.830
 He is so happy. His courage and commitment, determination and devotion are so deep. And the Mala

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.000
 Reva becomes as Mala Reva's.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:35.210
 And the great master from Chippah, when he met his root teacher, he did an exam in a life and

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:41.000
 immediately he caught it and it was strategic and he became the master of great masters.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 And then in the Indian, there were so many great things. For example, Naropa met him at the level.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.560
 Again he did an exam. Just hearing the names of the level, he caught it and even met all the

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.000
 different harsh difficulties.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 Completely stone is solid and reached the enlightenment.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:09.200
 So this is the one thing that how those great masters, when they talk, they didn't really examine

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.000
 all these things.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 But they received the teaching and then practiced it and they reached enlightenment.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 So that is how this is done.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 But this time, he told him, "Don't you know what to say here? I pay homage to my teacher."

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:40.460
 So his teacher, he said, as his teacher, "As in Bodhima, O, Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, every

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:41.000
 enlightenment, I pay homage."

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:48.980
 And that is in the Buddha teaching, only said, "Lama represents O in the Buddha teaching, in the V

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:49.000
aidhyana teaching."

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 Teacher represents all of those qualified teachers.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 That is for us, when we meet the qualified teacher, they are a representative of all that.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 So seeing that and pay respect and devotion with full of devotion.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 So that is really about the teacher and again.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:17.060
 And then one in the teaching said, "Also, that generally, as he said, the Bodhima teacher, there is

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.000
 no perfect teacher.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.740
 There is always, I mean, there is no perfect teacher. There is no one who can find perfect teachers

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:26.000
.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 There is always errors, mistakes. Maybe the teacher that we only meet, they are also in the park.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 They are practicing. So I'm up there on them."

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 But what is it what the teaching said? I'm sure many of you know that.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 Poor reliance, poor reliable, poor reliable.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 And what is it? Relying on the teaching not to the individuals.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 Relying on the teaching not to the individuals. Is it true?

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 We can not be enjoy with that individuals. Whatever that is, man and woman, whatever that is.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 But because we can, because of the teaching. So that teaching is what we are really attracted to.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 That is what we rely on.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 Then one in the teaching one, teaching also has two.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 And word teaching and meaning teaching. World and meaning. W-O-R-D.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:47.990
 What Buddha teaching said? When he comes to the teaching, not relying on the world, but on the

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:49.000
 meaning.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 Not just what language he uses or something. Think of the meaning.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 That is more important. That's what we like to observe. It's the essence of the world.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
 World is a world. A meaning is important.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 Then when he comes to the meaning, what in the Buddha's teaching said?

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 Relying on the ultimate meaning, not interpretable meanings.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 I'm sure you heard those interpretable meanings.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:26.000
 Relying on the ultimate meaning, not interpretable meaning.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 Such that means can be interpreted.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 Ultimate meanings. When he comes to the meaning, not relying on the conception,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 but relying on the versatility. Then there are no merits, no mistakes, no disappointments.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 It's perfect. So therefore, what do we want?

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
 What do we want the student to observe us?

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 Practition is what we want. We want the teaching. Teaching, we want meaning.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 Unchangeable, ultimate meaning. Ultimate meaning, how we are going to observe.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 Not the conceptual level, but we are going to observe that in the Muslim level.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:27.000
 Absolute level. Those are the teachings. So that is what it is.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 And now, so that is really about the post lamas, how many lamas?
