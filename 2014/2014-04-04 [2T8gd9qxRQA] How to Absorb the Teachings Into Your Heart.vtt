00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.460
 "We are going to start here today and we go again, this is something that we explore in the meaning

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.800
 and the teaching of Dzogchen by practices.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:15.900
 We won't go too fast all this, because slowly by slowly, but really we are going to practice.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.620
 Practice is observing our teaching. All the teaching that we are going to visit until now, from all

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.880
 the great Masters and from Kintin, Kinti, Pardesh and Arunu,

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:33.000
 we are going to observe what that is. We are going to observe this teaching in three different ways

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.100
, as this great Master said.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:43.380
 Those are known as what? What is the meaning of the three? Three trainings, we are trying to

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.880
 observe this teaching with three trainings.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:58.760
 The first training is 'moralities, conduct'. Second teaching training is 'concentrations'. And the

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.880
 third is 'verseness'.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:08.750
 And through these three, we are trying to observe the teaching. So that means all the teaching that

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:09.880
 we are going to visit,

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:20.250
 until now, we are going to observe that true, our heart, deep heart, our heart, and let bloom, let

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.880
 we glorify that teaching.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:33.300
 In the conduct level, we go humble, simple, low key, and then we are already in hermitage. Hermit

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.880
age, we are hermitage.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:41.570
 What means 'hermitage' is in the quote. But in the Buddha teaching, said hermitage means something

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:42.880
 that you become so simple,

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:52.880
 so humble, so quiet, so peaceful, and not let destruction our South by any means.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.430
 When we start talking of that, what to not destruct? We have to have three things, we have three

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.880
 things.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:06.480
 Not let destruction our body by the mundane. Not let destruction our speech by the mundane care

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.880
 your own will.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.880
 Not let destruction our mind with older, happy parents.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:20.340
 We are going to bring up all the sport light. All those other habitages are going to interrupt or

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.880
 coming out, going in prayer.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:29.880
 Immediately we are going to sport light, which means we are putting everything out in beautiful,

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.880
 rather wisdom-enlightened, intelligent status.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:38.880
 Release them, let it go. How are we going to do it? We are not going to do it like here in Ayana,

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:39.880
 all those apparatus.

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:46.350
 We are going to use a zolty technique, highest techniques, techniques that the Buddha taught. Some

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.880
 liberators.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:56.500
 All habit patterns that are going to disturb our verminage level of the body, spirit, mind, we are

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.880
 going to liberate that.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:08.480
 Self-liberated, body, habit, man, we self-liberate it. And speech is hard to hold, habit, man, self

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.880
-liberate it.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:17.800
 And mind holds habit, self-liberate it. How are we going to do it? We are not going to follow each

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.880
 upper habit.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:26.840
 If we start to follow each upper habit patterns, one Buddha uses examples, following as like doggy

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.880
 stars, imitation of a doggy star.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.880
 One Buddha says, we throw the stone to the dog, dog follows with the stones.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.900
 So that means that we start following the old habit, we are almost imitating dog following the old

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.880
 habit pattern, trying to do something.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:50.880
 Then there is endless, we are not going to catch. But we are going to start the blind stars,

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.880
 looking to the source immediately.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:00.880
 Source is art. Even we are talking three things, body, speech, the mind. There are three things.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:07.880
 The fundamental soul is mind, zolty teaching. He said it is true. We are going to look to the mind.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:14.640
 The moment we are going to destruct ourselves, we are ready to detect something, old habit patterns

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.880
, body.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:21.850
 Maybe we are going to be looking to the fearlessly, courageously, openly, openly looking to our

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:22.880
 natural mind.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:33.880
 And we relax. That freshness stages. The moment we are destructing by the speech, speech, hermitage

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:33.880
.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:40.870
 Again we are not going to follow up to that, still looking, right at that moment, ready to detect

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.880
 something, that way.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.880
 And then relax. Again, that is called self-liberate.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:55.880
 Among all the techniques, all the methods, this is the zolty accepted, the most powerful.

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:02.880
 And then mind, all the different emotions, past memories, future plans, present conceptions,

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.880
 expanded that.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:11.350
 Not going to chasing up that. When we detect that our mind is going that way, immediately we are

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:13.880
 going to look to the edge of the mind.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.880
 That release that. Relax on that.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:25.600
 We do these practices as we say, this time we are trying to relieve, strengthen, glorify, deepen up

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.880
 our practice, the teaching that we received.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:35.960
 Confused. Moment. Are we able to do that self-liberating? What is zolty teaching? That name is also

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:36.880
 not a name.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:43.460
 It is a teaching, cutting sorrow. It is not cutting something subject or object level with

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:49.880
 forcefully that, but with peaceful, with very humble and simple.

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:54.880
 There is no hassle in the process. No these and that things.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.880
 Are we able to do that? That is a practice.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:07.880
 And bring up more joy, more devotions, more compassion, no appreciations.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.880
 Bring up that. Citizen qualities. Where this means looking, practicing, retreat.

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:19.880
 We are going to practice the citizen qualities of joy and appreciation, love and compassion.

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:23.880
 And always understanding, respect and appreciation, patience.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:29.130
 As we are going to touch that all corners of something is hiding behind at the corner in the dark

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:29.880
 alleys.

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:34.880
 Today we are going for everything in sport life. Glorify that up.

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:40.880
 We become, we are going to make ourselves great, the boring, fearless yogis in the yogis.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.880
 Through this, loading up our self.

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:49.880
 That is, that is just going, the kind of intellectual going one up and this and that things.

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:55.880
 Really each turn deep in you. This. We receive a lot of teachings from our great masters.

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.880
 We are not shorting of the teachings, but what we are.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.880
 We are maybe really trying to glorify. That is what we need.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.880
 We are going to make meaningful of them.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:10.880
 Such as, look, this is how God is going to learn. How we did practice, how we made it.

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:14.880
 He made all those great teachers in his areas.

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:18.880
 Here is received teaching in Arizona there.

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.880
 Such become one of the great warriors.

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:25.880
 The warrior that defeated hope and fears.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:30.880
 All the negative emotions. That is the warriors. The fearlessness.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.880
 Emergent, joint rugged, samsara and naranas.

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:37.880
 He don't have to skip from the samsara, nor fall into the samsara.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:42.880
 And also falling, jump into the narana and avoid the samsara.

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:46.880
 Emergent, rugged, samsara, center stage.

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:53.880
 This great master, as all those great practices, master, we are really trying to follow.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:59.880
 That puts down these great lines. Well, fearlessness, follow that.

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:05.880
 So that is our kind of like, set forward our goal and aim of this time.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:12.880
 We start touching to our goal, our heart and really settling, bring our shiny sports.

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:15.880
 Sports, that is what it is.

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:20.880
 And we also realize that, then we go. We have every meditation, every practice.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:26.370
 That we do this, then what we do. If we keep that light in beautifully, those are known as true her

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:26.880
mitage.

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:32.880
 True retreat. Hermitage of body, hermitage of speech, hermitage of the mind.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:38.880
 And combined to again, two different narcombarment there, we are in one single stage.

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:42.880
 Truly, we are then true retreats.

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:48.880
 When we develop that thought and that realization, that wherever we are, we are in retreat state.

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.880
 We are in the beautiful state.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:57.880
 Those great zoki masters, gold zoki practitioners, where they sit and stay in the city,

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:02.880
 where they sit and stay in the hermitage, it doesn't make difference.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:08.880
 That is our goal, goal to strengthen that realization.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:15.100
 This realization is again not something that we, I'm talking something big things, big things that

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:15.880
 we don't know.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:23.880
 We're talking about something simple, true love, compassion, a joy, an appreciation,

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:29.880
 respect, an openness. That is what it is.

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:34.880
 That is zoki. Zoki means what? Great completion.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:39.880
 Not missing, not jumping, not dividing, not slowing out.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:47.880
 That's not. That is joy. That is hope. That is fear. Fears. Fears.

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:53.880
 We like to go out of that bondage. We like to release that.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:58.880
 So that is what it is and we stop here. Okay. Thank you everyone.
