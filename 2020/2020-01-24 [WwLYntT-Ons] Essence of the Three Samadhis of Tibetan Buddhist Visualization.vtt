00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.500
 I think you need to talk a little bit about three samadis. I think you all know. I will talk again.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:17.640
 Three samadis, like we practiced in the meditation, particularly kind of highlight the teaching of

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.000
 visualization, visualize the deity.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 So that deity or that Buddha came from these three samadis.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 And the first samadhi is the sakinesa samadhi.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 All the Ashutosh can be the true nature of samadhi.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 Samadhi means meditation, all the absorbance there is. So meditating on the true nature.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:56.750
 Second meditation is kaladhi samadhi, kaladhi samadhi. Third is siddhisa, siddhisa syllable samadhi

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.000
 or siddhisamadhi.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.280
 So now how that works. Now deity when we visualize the deity or the Buddha when we visualize it is

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.000
 totally in light place.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 So therefore it comes that the Buddha is emanated from the origin state of nature.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.990
 And that is of course the nature of our own mind that is not deluded by what we are talking today,

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.000
 or you all know, the duality.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 So it is not deluded by duality. So first it is relaxing our mind in that natural sense.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 Or, if I say use the joking word, rupasthas. Relax in the rupa, rupasthas.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 And the rupa is the full of vitality and the kaladhi.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 That is time kaladhi, so that is sakinesa samadhi.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 Second is samadhi is then the kaladhi.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:01.630
 Kaladhi in this time is the compassion. So power of compassion arises from that nature, from the

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.000
 nature of the mind.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:11.230
 It is arising just unceasingly provided to all the directions, everywhere that the morning sun

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.000
 shines.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 All that is like disability and that compassion is arising.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 And after that is the second samadhi, kaladhi samadhi or kaladhi meditation.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 And the third one is siddhi samadhi.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:36.050
 Siddhi samadhi or siddhi meditation, that is now, for example, the Vaidyarvani is home syllables, s

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.000
iddhi syllables.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:45.230
 That siddhi syllable is no other than one's own nature of the mind, not the form of the home syll

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.000
ables.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 What that home syllable is, is union of the emptiness and clarity.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 On the other hand, also in the teaching said, union of the wisdom and compassion, of the old nature

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 of your own mind,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 which is not deluded by the duality, that appeared as home syllables.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:18.280
 Home syllable is now from that, then all the display of the Vaidyarvani arise, including Vaidyarv

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.000
ani's form and all that arise.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.380
 So it is therefore, it is Vaidyarvani's form, or it is the magical display of our own nature of the

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.000
 mind.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 It is not something that we are really, Vaidyarvani has extended some parts of trying to be nice.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 That s not our own old nature, and my nature of the mind is so flexible.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 We are talking naturally, it just, I mean everything.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 So this time, my own nature of the mind, a Vaid, home syllable, this is the essence of that.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 From that, all the pure land, all the elements, all the retinas, all everything came from that.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 But all that big retinas, all that nature, all those displays, is nature is wisdom and compassion,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 all nature is emptiness, and nature is compassion, union, you know that.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 That is the seed samadhi. From that, then arising, from that seed, kind of asks for me,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 of course, suddenly, but instantly, then, your self becomes as Vaidyarvani.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:39.350
 As accidental, wisdom, random body of love and compassion, wisdom as not substantial, solid

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.000
 existence,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 is all display of the wisdom. So that is the three samadhis,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 and I remind it to you, and you, we heard so many times, times, I didn t know that.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 Okay, thank you very much. Thank you.
