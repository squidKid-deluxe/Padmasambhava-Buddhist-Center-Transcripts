Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche\nPSL One Month Dzogchen Retreat on Chetsun Nyingtik\nPadma Samye Ling Retreat Center\nApril 12 - May 10, 2025\n\nDay 9\nMay 2, 2025\n\nThe first Dzogchen masters left this world in a characteristic way: in a rainbow body of light after giving a final teaching to their disciples. In Tibet, the ones who spread the Nyingtik (heart essence) teaching of Clear Light were the great masters who possessed their special direct transmission, chiefly the great scholar Vimalamitra and Guru Padmasambhava. Vimalamitra passed these instructions to Chetsun Senge Wangchuk, who also attained the rainbow body. The teachings he left were later revealed by the First Khyentse, and are part of the secret category of Dzogchen pith instructions, Mengagde.\n\nThese rare and extraordinarily profound teachings precisely explain various essential methods for directly actualizing the innermost teachings of Ati Dzogpa Chenpo, the Great Perfection, the Peak Vehicle, which is the direct method for swiftly realizing the ultimate nature of the mind and attaining buddhahood in the rainbow light body.\n\nLearn more about this retreat:\nwww.padmasambhava.org/event-details-registration/restricted-silent-one-month-dzogchen-retreat-at-psl-w-ven-khenpo-tsewang-rinpoche-april-12-may-10-2025\n\nLearn more about the Chetsun Nyingtik:\nwww.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Chets%C3%BCn_Nyingtik\n\nwww.padmasambhava.org",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.900
 Thank you very much, everyone, for participating. Thank you. Good morning, everyone.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:13.310
 Again, we're going to re-strengthen him, re-activate our beautiful motivation, which is ongoing,

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:15.800
 going at practices all the time.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:21.920
 That, and we're going to re-activate that beautiful intention and thought, and that's all come

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.700
 together as three stages.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:31.110
 First, the joy in the appreciation, very more joy, more appreciation. Joy in the appreciation is

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.400
 being ourselves as beautiful human beings.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:40.520
 All different conditions, circumstances, both as this beautiful life, beautiful really as a human

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:47.100
 being, with physical level, mental level, and all that is perfect and beautiful.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:54.510
 We are completely equipped, whistled to practice Dharma, and how fortunate we are, how lucky we are

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.300
, which is blessed by the great teacher,

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:04.100
 Buddha Shakyamuni, as well as all the three years, and our good deeds of the past combined together

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.700
, both these beautiful lives and pressures.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:13.430
 And we are happy in the joy, appreciation, and at the same time, have courage and commitment and

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.500
 confidence and determination.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.620
 All those beautiful tools that I'm going to use this opportunity for beautiful purpose, make even

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:29.520
 better in beauty more thou and for future, as well as myself, to all the beings, again combined

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.900
 with the Bodhi Jata.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.500
 The gracious teacher and all the Buddhas, enlightened beings, those Bodhisattvas, and linear

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:45.360
 masters. One warrior said the Bodhi Jata is the most powerful, the essential of all the practice in

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.300
 meditation, we do that.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:54.040
 Even we do the Doki meditation, and the Tutu meditation, Toga meditation, Talon, Tomo practice, no

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.600
 matter whatever we do, we do the Bodhi Jata as no nutritious, there is no essence.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.950
 Essence is kind of essence, has completely kind of hello, and no nutrition, nothing, really it's

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.900
 just like kind of like, just only the names, not too much.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:16.410
 But if we have the Bodhi Jata from our hearts and mind, as we all know, the Paul, immaculable

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:25.200
 thought, and in the gracious teacher, the Bodhi Jata, and all the great masters mentioned, Bodhi,

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:32.840
 we summarize all that in one simple way to tell, it's compassion, the compassion that has no border

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.500
, no restrictions, and compassion.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.840
 And we bring that down to the one simple kind of world, and the teaching said, then the common name

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:49.710
 is good heart. Good heart, that is, for that reason in the teaching often said, if you have a good

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:58.100
 heart, your path and the Bhumi will be good, or good heart make the path, and Bhumi all were good.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:05.510
 And we don't have the good heart, our path and the Bhumi won't make, it make the Bhumi and the path

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:13.100
 of the lower path, lower realms, or some degree higher realms, whatever, it won't go further.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:20.530
 So to make that as perfect, and beautiful, as we learned, as we received the teaching is, in the

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:28.140
 teaching said, good heart, all the Bodhi Jata, good heart for all living beings, for everyone

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:37.330
 really have a weak and good thought, as we ever can, as I want like to be, and weak that all the

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.700
 living beings are up in joy and peace.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:46.720
 And having that attitude, this is very simple, kind of very common, but that touched the bottom and

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:52.910
 the corner and foundation of the very teaching and as well as the center pillar of the very

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:58.300
 teaching of the gracious teacher, Buddha Shaxamani, all the teachings.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:05.950
 So that Bodhi Jata is, that is, with that Bodhi Jata, then having more realizations, or more brain

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:13.870
 understanding of three G, three Kaya status or perfect resolution, that Bodhi Jata intention is

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:25.690
 expanded, elaborated as three Kaya status, or five perfect status, or that expanded from the Bodhi

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.300
 Jata, Bodhi.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:34.440
 So therefore, Bodhi Jata is really in the teaching mentioned always, and as well as the great

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:41.740
 master, everyone sit, sit, sit, it is so, so special, so important, and without that, this is no

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:48.300
 matter whatever we're thinking to practice all that, it just become not true, it's not vibrating,

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.300
 it's not have the energy, it's not have the vitality.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:59.780
 It's just a kind of like dragging ourselves, that we have the Bodhi Jata, is shimmering, is sizz

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:08.190
ling, is energetic, is forceful, and so beautiful, perfectly, every aspect, and feel kind of looking

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:16.120
 to inward to ourselves, we feel happy and joy, joy, ourself uplifting ourself, and also other

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.900
 people, also somebody feel that, feel happy and joy, peaceful, kind of feel closeness.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:29.640
 To you as a friend, it's true. That's what the greatest teacher, Bodhi Jata, or those great master

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:36.650
 and meditator, so many animals are coming to them, not as a wider or trying to bring naturally

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:44.500
 coming, joining with them, because of love, because of the vision, they feel the energy of love,

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:49.820
 they're not going to hurt you, they're not just hurting, they're going to help benefit, feel the

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.500
 animals even that.

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:57.620
 Those are really teaching, said, witnessed by the old, that when you have that good heart and

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:04.710
 thought, this is not just also in a Buddha, even I saw or heard that news from those great senses,

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:12.030
 senses, incisionities, those senses, so many animals are following with those senses, naturally, it

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:18.500
's not something trying to catch them, because they feel so calm and peaceful, peaceful.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:25.440
 This is the powerful love, powerful compassion, so that is the very foundation of the practices,

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:33.240
 practices, practices and all those beautiful, incision, thought, and now we go to the, again, this

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.500
 great teaching of the first great chansei.
