00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.640
 This is known as the holding the lineage of the scripture and holding the lineage of the meaning of

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.000
 that scripture.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 In order to be there, in a Tibetan Buddhism, it is very known as shedra and drubdra.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:30.440
 Drubdra is the practicing, keeping up the meaning of the teaching and shedra is the teaching that

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.000
 we are keeping up.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 The exiling the teaching itself. So, with it studying, with it contemplating, put together

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 upholding the teaching with it three manners.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 Those are known as Den, as like, what's it called? Three Valet Dettas, which is known as Den.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 They are Perception Valet Dettas and as well as Emperance Valet Dettas.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:12.370
 And then with it, as well as, according to the instructions of the teachings, that, through that,

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.000
 and then developing Valet.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 Valet, which is often known as Den, Yichigipatam, something that you develop your confidence,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 understand why that was.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 Two Valet Dettas, through that two Valet Dettas, then you develop.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.490
 The third one, that's something that is led further to use our own Emperance technique, because it

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.000
's something far.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.190
 And for example, and this is just an example, as we at the beginning of time, what I said, Buddha

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.000
 said,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:57.370
 from the time of the Rev. Jungkor Jung, until that number is A, he contributed to the fifty-five

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.000
 pardons.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 The great Buddha, and met practice, received teaching, he never bowled in time.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.450
 This word, similar like this word, something that we really don't have exactly through here, right

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.000
 here, that, that.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:24.190
 But however, with the trusty word of the teaching, Buddha himself, that looking, kind of comparing

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.000
 throughout all the teachings,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 from the Hinayana, all the Vedayana, his words, his statements, what is contradicting or not.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.920
 Looking through all that, there is no contradictions. Everything falls in its own space and the

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.000
 support to activating the understanding of the deeper meanings

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 in each and every level is moving forward. Therefore, therefore, what every teaching looks like,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 very principle looks worth it.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 Therefore, we can count in his words. And plus, without the cause and condition, such realization

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 or such achievement cannot happen.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.840
 Happen, and that is, again, through the evidence of looking the cause and conditions and its result

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.000
, effort.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.990
 Looking that, there is no result, good result, welcome the good cause and conditions, obviously in

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:26.000
 the world.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:35.410
 So therefore, putting all those, putting everything, putting together, then this heart, wallet,

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.000
 cognition, evidence, that must be.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 That must be because all is correct. All is correct. Therefore, this must be true.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 And this also, in a way, everything has cause and condition, that which is developing.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 So such as the realization of this, like Buddha, is not going to come by itself like that.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 Therefore, and it is. Therefore, we can walk. We can walk to our practice in meditation to continue

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 pursuing as the role model of the Buddha Shakyamuni,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:22.360
 the role model of the Gurdakama Sambhava, and all those great masters of both India and Tibet, they

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.000
 are our role models.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:33.930
 And we put our effort and our love, our devotion, as they did, we have every right, every

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:39.000
 opportunity that we will get similar realization.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:46.780
 And that what they said, that was proved, and that's what I see in the related world. If things are

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:54.000
 cause and conditions are perfect, there is no powers, powers to develop it.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:04.990
 No push, push, push to develop the result. No way, no way, Jose. Truly, no way, Jose. There is no

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.000
 way, Jose, that we will get the result.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 We will get the result. If there is a cause and conditions are perfect, there is no stop. No stop.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:26.490
 The result will come in evidence. And that's true. We cannot deny. We cannot deny. And we cannot

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.000
 deny that. That's the way. Thanks all.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:38.380
 Therefore, take the role models of this. Then, we practice, we study. So in that level, then

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:44.000
 practicing the academic level of the script lineage is known as the Chaita.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:52.330
 And then, practice meaning of what you study, and practice that with meditation and practice. That

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.000
 is known as the Dripa.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.990
 As I said the other day, we had a great opportunity to combine Thogadhi. In numerous schools

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:06.000
 between Buddhism, they don't separate these two, both combined Thogadhi.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:13.900
 As our great Kithi Pradhi Shiramud mentioned so many times, he highlighted that there is no separ

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.000
ations. Both are union.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:26.110
 Practice time, you starting too. And starting time, you practice. It's not just east and west. I

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.000
 joined Thogadhi.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:37.690
 This is known as union of the practice and study. In Tibet, it is known as Khedra Sundar. That is,

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:43.000
 Khedra is studying, Dripa is practicing, and combine Thogadhi.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.720
 Combine Thogadhi with joy, with appreciation, with humility, with the symbol, respect and

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:58.000
 appreciation, carrying the bodhicitta, fill the heart with the bodhicitta, kindness and compassion,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 thought, and reflecting that.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:12.970
 That is the practice of Dripa. They have humble humility, respect and then open mind, looking

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:18.000
 forward, not saying in the past.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:29.070
 Practice means we are futuristic. We are moving forward with vision, with goal, with bright opening

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:35.000
, eyes of the wisdom and activating our inner beauties.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:42.290
 And the beauties that we are around and surrounded in a continuing movement. That is the whole map

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:50.000
 and identity of the practice. Not just close and tight and forced.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 That is not the way. That's what the great great Buddha told at the very beginning of the time.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:03.600
 When he gave to the teachings of the five disciples, all, not the narcissistic way, not the luxury

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.000
 way, and the middle way, it's the our way.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:14.080
 Middle way is the natural way. It's not just our way. It is the way of the natural. That's how all

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.000
 things are developed.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:22.200
 When you look to the inner extent, cause and the condition, for example, we therefore perfectly

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:25.000
 balance it, we will develop the result.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:32.990
 If anything is extreme, we won't get the result. Ask and we won't get the fruit. Ask to the like

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:42.000
 nurseries. We can ask them, nurseries, how we get good flowers, how we get good fruits.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 Ask them and balance harmonize that way we activate it.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:57.000
 With this understanding, now we follow with the teachings continually and today.
