NOTE     "synopsis": "On August 26, 2016 at Padma Samye Ling, His Eminence Terton Namkha Drimed Rinpoche bestowed a Guru Rinpoche empowerment and teaching according to his own mind terma.\n\nAt the conclusion of the empowerment, His Eminence was requested by Ven. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche to please teach on how he discovered the reincarnation (yangsi) of our precious teacher, Ven. Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche.\n\nIn this video, His Eminence explains how he found the definite and unmistaken reincarnation of Ven. Khenchen Palden Yangsi Rinpoche, who he named Palden Yonten Thaye Lodro Chokyi Gyaltsen!\n\nDownload an Edited Transcription of this teaching: http://d31hzlhk6di2h5.cloudfront.net/20160909/1d/c9/d1/02/aede44961e173203886a6d7f/HE_Terton_Namkha_Drimed_Rinpoche_Discovering_the_Reincarnation_of_Khenchen_Palden_Sherab_Rinpoche_8_26_16.pdf\n\nwww.padmasambhava.org\n\n\"HE Namkha Drimed Rinpoche is the supreme head of the Ripa lineage of Nyingma Vajrayana Buddhism and is a living terton. The Ripa lineage has its historical roots in Glorious Master Ripa Pema Deje Rolpa, the leader of both the family and Dharma lineages of Rigon Tashi Choeling Monastery.\n\nFrom the age of 8, Namkha Drimed Rinpoche has had numerous pure visions of Guru Rinpoche, who conferred on him empowerments and spiritual advice beyond measure. Due to the blessings he received on these occasions, His Eminence was granted personal transmissions of a veritable ocean of profound hidden treasures of enlightened intent. In addition, he has been graced with visions of the Eight Manifestations of Guru Rinpoche, Hayagriva, Dorje Drolo, Mahottara Heruka, Avalokiteshvara, the dakini Yeshe Tsogyal, the divine consort Mandarava, and others from among the entire vast array of peaceful and wrathful dieties of the Three Roots (Guru, Yidam, Dakini). In particular, he has had repeated visions of Lord Gesar -- the great Lion and Wish-Fulfilling Gem -- surrounded by hosts of his spiritually accomplished kinsmen, receiving their blessings. On the basis of this, he has codified the cycle entitled Rigsum Norbui Gongdzo (Treasury of the Enlightened Intent of the Gem of the Three Buddha Families), which is a very exalted and timely spiritual teaching.\n\nHis Eminence is a regent of the Lake-Born Lotus, Guru Padmasambhava, in the world. He is a Terton, revealer of hidden treasures, an emanation of one of Guru Rinpoche\u2019s close personal students. He was Arya Sale, consort to Guru Rinpoche\u2019s primary disciple Yeshe Tsogyal.\n\nPreviously, in India, he was Sariputra, one of Buddha Shakyamuni\u2019s top two disciples. Also he was Kukuraja who received a personal transmission of the tantric teachings concerning the supreme secrets; and as the Master Mahahumkara, he accomplished Samyak, the diety of enlightened mind.\n\nIn Tibet, the Land of Snows, his lineage of rebirths includes Namkhai Nyingpo, the monk of the Nub clan; the master of awareness Gyalwa Chokyang; and Rechung Dorje Drakpa (Rechungpa), the heart son of the venerable Milarepa who established the Kagyu monastic lineage. In the Kingdom of Lingtri Karmo in eastern Tibet, he was reborn as Dongbumpai Gyatsa Zhalkar, the Chief Lord amongst the multitude of the warrior king Lord Gesar\u2019s spiritually accomplished kinsmen. He was Gesar\u2019s brother. He was also Gyalwa Gotsangpa, an accomplished master of the Drukpa Kagyu school.\n\nIn particular, Namkha Drimed Rinpoche was reborn as the omniscient Longchenpa, often referred to as \u2018The King of the Dharma\u2019, the famous Great Perfection master whose writings are studied today by Dzog Chen practitioners. As Longchenpa, he was the great helmsman of the teachings of the supreme spiritual approach of utter lucidity. Longchenpa is commonly recognized as the greatest thinker and most brilliant mind ever to arise within the Nyingma School of Buddhism.\n\nAmong the 100 or more great tertons who were emanations of Guru Rinpoche\u2019s personal students, His Eminence was Tangtong Gyalpo. Among the 13 great tertons who revealed hidden treasure teachings of the Vajrayana approach, His Eminence was Mingyur Dorje Drakpo Nudentsal; also the fourth sublime Taksham incarnation Padma Gyepai Dorje; as well as the incarnation Lord Padma Deje Rolpa of Ripa. In later times he was Do Khyentse Yeshe Dorje, a powerful lord among accomplished masters, and the great and exalted Padma Lingpa, who was a magical emanation of the bodhisattva of supreme compassion. The great master of Orgyen, Guru Rinpoche, who knows the Three Times, clearly attested in his vajra prophecies to the pure rebirths that His Eminence would take.\"\n\nCopied from: http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/Namkha_Drimed_Rinpoche\n\nFor more information about His Eminence Namkha Drimed Rinpoche, please visit His website: www.ripaladrang.org",

 (speaking in foreign language)

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:28.480
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:34.720
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:52.240
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:58.240
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:20.240
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:23.580
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:27.500
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:57.340
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:09:57.340 --> 00:10:07.180
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:11.340
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:17.340
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:27.420
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:39.480
 And then, in the time of the Uyghur Masombaba,

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:42.380
 a modified disciple from Uyghur Masombaba,

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:45.660
 he was as a Soho, the one,

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:49.000
 one of the fortified disciples of Uyghur Masombaba.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:57.500
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:13.720
 - And during the Kesa's time,

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:16.440
 and the Kesa had so many ministers,

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:19.400
 many warriors, eminated as warriors,

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.160
 there's so many, and among them,

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.560
 the one is the well-known, or the one of the highest,

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:27.320
 the emanate of the warrior of the Kesa minister,

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:29.160
 known as the Demas.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:30.840
 And the Demas, again,

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:33.480
 one of the foremost of the minister assistants,

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:35.920
 the Demas, is known as the Guri Jamsim,

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:37.820
 so, again, he did what he knew,

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:40.660
 it was the emanation of the Guri Jamsim.

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:44.500
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:46.760
 And then he said, "All those come so clearly,

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:49.760
 "that then I don't have to be a doubt

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.100
 "of the reconnections."

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:54.560
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.500
 And that's because of that,

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:59.340
 all those indications and the graduations,

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:03.460
 all the visions, then I decided to come home

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:06.920
 of the reconnection of the Guri Jamsim.

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:10.840
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:21.660
 And this is before I'm coming to the Demas summon,

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:25.080
 the day before, before I'm coming to the Demas summon,

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:27.040
 and that I'm really not thinking about

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:30.620
 the reincarnation of the Kesa minister.

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:34.220
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:46.060
 And so, again, in the region,

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:49.460
 and that the Gari Jamsim,

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:52.700
 that the Gari Jamsim's mother,

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:56.700
 Gari Jamsim's mother must be coming in some assembly hall,

00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:00.060
 assembly hall, and she's carrying,

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:04.180
 or she's with the reincarnation of the Gari Jamsim.

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:08.260
 Now, this time, the Gari Jamsim is very strong

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.220
 and strong to think.

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:14.140
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:19.980
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:28.020
 And that time, generally, right behind

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:31.420
 of the reincarnation of the Gari Jamsim,

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:34.160
 his mother, the day is, then,

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:38.300
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:43.300
 is the very, again, warrior of the duty of the Kesa.

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:47.880
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:52.360
 But he's always been with his eminence,

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:55.740
 eminence since he was 10 years old,

00:13:55.740 --> 00:14:00.060
 always as a lefard, an un-separate rebel,

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:02.980
 or the shadow, never suffered as a shadow,

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:06.580
 a being, and always giving instructions,

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:07.900
 and for a religion.

00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:11.740
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:15.200
 At that time, right behind of the reincarnation

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:19.420
 of the Gari Jamsim, his mother was standing,

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:24.180
 he said, "Say, this reincarnation of the Gari Jamsim

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:27.660
 is truly, and we don't have to doubt.

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:30.180
 This is unnecessary reincarnation,

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:32.020
 we don't need any doubt."

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:37.180
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:45.580
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:57.620
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:09.860
 And as, and then, also,

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:13.940
 they asked the question to me, and to discover,

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:16.620
 and with all those indications,

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:20.460
 and carefully examined, and following

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:25.220
 with the, those explanations, one after another,

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:28.980
 and so it is confirmed, that it will not be doubt,

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:32.300
 and not just only that, even just before I'm coming,

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:35.820
 I have that dream of a region, region again,

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:40.820
 so truly, it is unmistakable reincarnation of Gari Jamsim.

00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:46.260
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:09.740
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:31.740
 Now, you know, let's go over now.

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:34.900
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:39.900
 Now, we just go over the reincarnation of the Gari Jamsim.

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:43.620
 And then, and now, also, you do zilabu,

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:45.980
 teaching, (speaking in foreign language)

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:48.940
 the teaching, and then keep those teachings hard,

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:51.860
 and the practices, and then, you have good (speaking in foreign

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:53.500
 language) and all the facilities,

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:56.460
 everything's quite really good, and therefore,

00:16:56.460 --> 00:17:01.460
 and so, keep the practice, and activate the teaching,

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:06.700
 and that's it, and (speaking in foreign language)

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:09.620
 is you, and happy, and relaxed,

00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:13.540
 and meaningful of these lives.

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:17.460
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:34.220
 And I'm going to pray to get to expanding and progressing,

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:38.740
 or to develop this center, and this center,

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:41.940
 particularly the new Muscles are very different,

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:45.580
 and as well as this center, so we all pray

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:48.900
 that we can go so far as well, and do this.

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:52.980
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:02.140
 (crowd chattering)

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:30.780
 >> Thank you, everyone.
