00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.130
 This is the topic of this teaching. And the other day, again, always said so many times in the

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:15.000
 teaching and these old great masters said that's what they practiced it.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 First, this foundation is so important. So important, we have to have foundation.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 Foundation is to assemble such a good heart, devotion, and bodhichitta.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 That is what is. And within that context, we should practice ngondro.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 That I've mentioned yesterday a few times, or it's in the teaching said already.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 This ngondro and as well as these four renunciation thoughts, those all very, very necessary.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 Necessary because we let to glorify, reveal our treasure of the nature of the mind.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 And in order to do this, we need all those practices, these practices.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 This practice with ngondro is revealing our nature of the mind.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.370
 Four renunciation thoughts, we are revealing our natural mind. At the same time, we are settling

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:19.000
 down.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.490
 If we don't have the four renunciation thoughts, as well as these ngondro practices, many times we

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.000
 are hovering or we are hoofing.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 Hoofing? I don't understand that.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:43.470
 Like kangaroo. Hoofing. Hoofing. Hoofing. We are not really set on ground. Like hoofing. And

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.000
 carrying our habit pattern on the bottom.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 If kangaroo had this, I don't know. She or you will like that.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.840
 But we are, every one of these four renunciation thoughts, ngondro and bodhijata, we are hoping as

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:10.000
 the kangaroo carrying our habit pattern strongly in the body of ourself.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:19.900
 Therefore, true to kind of avoiding that habit pattern between that, so many lifetimes, countless

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.000
 lifetimes, therefore we have to settle down.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.400
 We have to grounded ourself. To be grounded ourself is the mondro practice, joy and devotion, bodh

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.000
ijata and humble and humility.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.980
 Those all need it. Those all need it. Many times, many practices start countering, I received this

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.000
 empowerment, I received this, I read this lama, that lama, this great teacher, this and that.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:54.130
 Of course it is really great. Great. But how much you really observe? Observe. Just so you know

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.000
 intellectually.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.260
 Intellectually you know, intellectually you received. That not going to serve the purpose, actually

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.000
 what we are looking forward to.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.270
 If you know all the mineral vatals in the world, it not going to remove your thirst, all our thirst

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.000
, unless we drink.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 This is knowing things, knowing things, true contract, this and these things. It's great.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:25.390
 Pose is great, but second we have to observe, we have to enjoy and happy. Happy what we have and

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.000
 move forward in that.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 That is what really we need it. So therefore this mondro practice is so important.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.250
 It is foundation, it is central column, it is our frame, it is an architectural frame to build our

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.000
 enlightenment qualities.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:48.400
 And therefore this mondro, in all this joy and devotion, what in mondro it is taught, that whole

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.000
 package is so important.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 And with that understanding, then we are going to add now, this is the second this practices.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 And that is here is also the universe, sit. Sit.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.960
 Second the main practice consists of having cut through misconception, concerning view, meditation

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.000
 and action.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 This is now second addition. Addition in a way we are doing now finishing touch.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 This is like finishing touch in a way.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.450
 And now for that, generally in the teaching that we have learned so many times, such as a great

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.000
 master K.J. Noorja, we have learned.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 There is two way to approach, two way to engage this.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:45.100
 This is called starting way, more kind of intellectual way approaching to this target or to the

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.000
 practices.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 Or very simple way to target to these practices.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 And the intellectual way is starting.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.320
 And this is what in the Buddha teaching, starting all the like, such as Vinaya teaching, Sutra

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.000
 teaching, Abhidharma teaching, those are the Buddha teaching.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:11.080
 And those are then more clarified, more summarized by such as great masters of the Naga Arjuna or

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.000
 the sixth ornament of India.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.630
 In India to where there are so many great masters, one after another, from the 8th century until

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:23.000
 now, there are so many great masters, wrote commentaries on those teachings.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 Teachings, that commentary means clarifications.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.190
 Clarifications can bring forth the split in the college of their teaching so that we can easily

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:37.000
 understand, more easily can put those, so many teachings.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 And those are starting that, from the teacher, or qualified teacher.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 And as you started and then contemplate all those teachings.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 So those are what is more kind of scholar ways.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:01.910
 Sometimes even in the teaching named, like scholar way to do the practices and then more kind of

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:10.000
 like a yogi style or yogi style, hermitage style to do the practices.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:17.110
 So the scholar way is more, this kind of like more in a way, also graduations, more gradually

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:18.000
 moving.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.660
 As tell that in all the different teachings, to understand the meaning of the teachings and then to

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:31.000
 move to the meaning, the meaning of the nature of all the phenomena existence.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:39.660
 And then, so that way, and again I think we heard so many times, is such as then, you know, is like

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.000
 Mademaka teachings.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:49.000
 Mademaka teaching is not just philosophy, what we learn in the intellectual things.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 Mademaka teaching is actually really practice.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 Practice, this is.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000
 And what Mademaka means, as you all know, is middle.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 Middle means not extreme.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:10.950
 And that's what in the teaching said, in the Buddha teaching, Sutra said, the thinking of existing

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:12.000
 is extreme.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 Thinking of not existing is extreme.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:25.130
 Moving from either extremes or avoiding all the extremes and moving to the middle, that is known as

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:28.000
 the Mademaka or the middle thought.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 Not holding on extremes of either side, existing, non-existing.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 And then many times in the teaching also said, neither and either.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 This is generally holding pattern.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 Holding is our grasping and our clinging.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 That's what we hold, we grasp.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000
 And nature is not either side, either side.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000
 Nature is completely, in a way, neutral status.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 Neither existing, nor existing, is beyond.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 And that's what the Mademaka teaching said.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:17.590
 And that is what the practice, when you establish that, then the Mademaka teaching immediately

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:20.000
 looks at externally,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 externally in the middle view, externally, non-existing, more engaging.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 But eventually it comes to the mind, who is holding that?

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 Existing, not existing.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 So it is a graduation way.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:52.080
 The first object is free from all those extremes, then moving to the subject is free from all the

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.000
 extremes.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 And that is the beauty of the Mademaka teaching.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:09.000
 Project, reasoning, all those used, astrology, the pramtha as in the teaching said, pramtha samsara

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000
, when all the well and nirvana is totally empty.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 Empty, free from the extremes.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 Empty means free from the extremes.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
 It's not something negation standing, not existing.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
 It's free from all the extreme things.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:31.130
 And then, Buddha said, also pramtha like, from the first path, all the way the enlightened path of

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:36.000
 enlightenment is also free from the existence.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 So it's moved from the out to the samsara in one way, and then moved to the in, to the mind.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:51.260
 And this is again in the Buddha's teaching, when we joined, also how Buddha established the view of

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.000
 this great Mademaka.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
 Mademaka, form is emptyness.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 He meant, he meant form because that's what we sentient beings are always looking for.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
 Form is emptyness.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
 This is what is easy for us.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 It's gross.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 Form is gross.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
 That's what we hold in them.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 Form is emptyness.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
 He used all those different reasons.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 This reason is not just a talk, but Buddha actually is pointing out.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 He's pointing out this phenomena existing is, is empty or the nature is neither sides.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 So form is emptyness.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
 Then, after the form, what is?

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
 I think feeling.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
 Then Buddha abbreviated.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 And then he said the form is emptyness, emptyness form, so forth.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:56.600
 And then he mentioned feeling, conception, perception, and consciousness are the same as you should

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:57.000
 see.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:05.000
 Saying that, then he moved from out in a way, from the object, then into the subject.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
 Then what is left?

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 All is free.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:17.000
 Every end point of the grasping, clinging, is released, removed.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 It's not that Buddha mad that.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 Mad that.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
 It's not just Buddha mad, mad that.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 But that's the way the things are.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
 The way the things are.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 And that's how the nature is.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:39.960
 And for that reason, Buddha chapter 1, he told, in the K Ching Buddha general, always take the

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:41.000
 quotation or announce it as so loudly.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:47.000
 Whether Buddha came to this world, nature didn't really change.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:54.000
 Whether Buddha did not come to this world, things not change the way things are.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
 Nothing changed.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.000
 Whether Buddha gave the teaching, that didn't do anything in the natural level.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000
 Or if he don't give teaching, that didn't do anything in the natural level.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
 Nature abides always the same as it is.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
 That's the true nature of what we are talking.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
 And that is the will of what we are talking.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
 The will.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 So this is more academic level.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
 And then, of course, there are so many logic, so many reasons.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 This logic and reason looks like it's pointing out.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:39.050
 But eventually, this great Master in Buddha leading to us is knocking down over all this regimen of

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:41.000
 duality, consumption.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 This grasping, the fired up, so many light turns, one after another, adding, adding, adding.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
 That is what is released.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 Therefore, these are like nuclear bombs to the grasping, to the clinging, to remove that.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 So that we can really reveal our beauty of nature.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:08.630
 What Buddha is talking, infinite love, infinite compassion, and wisdom that sees everything, almost

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:10.000
 everything.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:18.000
 That this is not what is happening now. Why? This grasping, the fired up, this illusion grasping,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000
 this regimen of consumption like clothes is completely blocked.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
 Blowed this natural nature.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
 And who did that?

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
 No one else did it.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 One's own mistake.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 And therefore, one's own deeds, we have to untie it.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 We, ourselves, have to be released that, that not.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
 This video, we have to clean this. We have to do everything.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 There's no one other welcome, clean, even cannot go to.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
 And that's what Buddha said.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 I cannot clean your, I cannot clean obscuration, clean.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 I cannot take weightless, but only I can show the path.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:10.000
 That means I can show technique, skills, methods, and tips.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
 Then it's up to you.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
 And that's why Buddha is not a great teacher.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 Buddha is also talking, teaching is accurate through the teaching.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 It's not just over and up things.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
 Exhale, that's the way things are.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000
 We have to release, we have to clean, we have to do.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 Ultimately, ourself is the doer. Ourself is the worker.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 And ourself is the helper to ourself.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 And therefore, that also can happen to other beings.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
 That is the one with those understanding.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 And then this all known as the scholarly.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 That is generally known as the scholarly.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:59.000
 And those examples such as the scholarly to discover the true nature is roughly,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000
 it's not just exactly that, but roughly we can tell.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 I sleep for example, Nagarudvara himself.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 And the Shendarathya, the great master, Shendarathya.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
 And then this is just an example.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 All those great masters, most of them got so great scholars and collective.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
 So great scholars.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
 And then they went to the meditation.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 And the great master in Naropa.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
 And those all.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
 And then as well in it were Nokhenpa.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 Great master, Mahara Nokis.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
 First Chetse. First Unter.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
 I mean all the, in Paparudon, all like this.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 They started, completed, mastered all the teachings of the Buddha.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
 And as well as master of all sciences of the Buddha,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
 or sciences of that one in the Buddha teaching,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 called five great sciences.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 Science, medicine, drug, language, medicine, drug.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 And the logic. And then Buddha teaching, drug.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 Sema, zou, zou.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000
 And then zou is a geometry, or what it's called?

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:14.000
 Geometry, or architectural, or the engineering.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
 All those in the zou.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
 When you read those great master books, they are really true.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 They are engineering.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
 They are artists. They are artists.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000
 They know all of this.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 They kept chemical to you.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 Chemist, chemistry.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
 So they mastered that.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 So in Tibet they used zou, zou, zou, and Naropa.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
 And this zou, zou, zou.
