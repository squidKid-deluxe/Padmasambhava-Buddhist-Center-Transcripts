00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.560
 First, and the second is, strengthening, strengthening, by stronger. So secondly, strengthening,

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:15.180
 and the third is, then, stabilize, completely stabilize.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:25.060
 The fourth one, when we use the great technique by the great teacher, Bodhachaktam Muni Mohasadam.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:32.140
 Such a teaching said, "Look at it, look at it." That simple technique, we discover what, in a

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:41.940
 religion, as I said, so many times now, that we discover, that, that is really what we discover.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:52.860
 But how long that lasts for us? That is, questions. We discover that, maybe, post one second. But

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:01.610
 after that, kind of, in a blurred way. In a way, in the deep, deep, closes in the sky, kind of,

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:09.410
 suddenly upward, window of the closed window, we see the sky. But then, immediately, in a blurred

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:10.500
 way. Blurred way.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:19.070
 Now, we discover the old and natural. Now, we have to keep the practice. So that, recognizing, is

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:29.960
 not enough. Now, we have to strengthen it. Strengthen it. By stronger. By stronger is only meant by

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.460
 the meditation. Practice. There is no other solution.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:43.770
 Meditation, practice, with devotion, with accumulation of merit, practices. As I said the other day

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.100
, and you all know, that is what many in a teaching mentioned, that.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:59.520
 Realization only comes by the accumulating the merit and with strong devotion to the lineage. Line

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:07.100
age. This is not intellectual business. Intellectual, this and that, sculpture. That is the world of

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.980
 duality.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:13.790
 If we are carried with those thoughts, then we are not really practicing. We are not going to gain

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:20.860
 realization. We only got some intellectual other things. We like to gain the progress. We have

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.190
 settled on our intellectual thoughts, skeptical thoughts, these and that things, and more

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.220
 determination, more courage, and accumulating the merit, the practice.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:36.080
 That is what I call teaching. Those accumulation has two accumulations. Accumulating merit

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:42.350
 practices and the wisdom merit, merit. You all know, too. Accumulating merit practices, all the

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:50.380
 virtuous activities, such as generosity practices, morality practices, patient practices, and

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:58.220
 concentration practices, all known as any day is connected with consumption, with good thought,

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.100
 good intention.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:07.620
 Is accumulation merit practices. Wisdom merit practices is Dokhi meditation. O Mahamadhu meditation

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:14.540
, Madhebaka meditation, Pandya Parambhata meditation, also in the tea gait. So relax on the natural

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:15.180
 state.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:22.360
 To bring the realization of the perfect understanding of the Dokhi realization, absolute truth,

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:34.620
 need accumulation merit. Along with devotions, joy and appreciation, fifth richness, richness and

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:42.860
 appreciation to the lineage, appreciation to the Buddha, all the Bodhisattvas, and all those

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.220
 lineage masters.

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:52.140
 That's why we really had this teaching. It's not something that we got out of the skull. Because,

00:03:52.140 --> 00:04:01.600
 dude, that means so many practitioners from 2,600 years ago, so many practices, practice these,

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:08.220
 continue courage, continue the past, and now we go. We now connect.

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:14.390
 We're connected to the golden chain of the lineage of the wisdom and the compassion. Lineage of

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:25.900
 this lineage is lineage of wisdom and compassion together. We connect to that golden chain. In our

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:35.920
 traces, our inheritance, our father's "A" or grandparent's "A" now we recapture that world of the

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.220
 wisdom lineage.

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:46.620
 We're going to observe to our own heart and mind, met ourself, one of those really warriors,

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:56.990
 warriors who defeated all samsara obstacles, negative emotions, truly become warrior, warrior

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:05.220
 inwardly, extendedly, so humble, so humble, humble, simple, daunted earth.

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:11.130
 And so kind in compassion, knowing kindness. One of the great reasons in the teaching is that when

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:18.440
 you have the realization of looking at teaching, you become that person who becomes so humble, so

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.220
 simple, so compassionate.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:30.550
 Kindness, really. That means the discovered innate nature, nature of the mind. Nature of the mind

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:39.210
 we discuss is trikaya. Trikaya means Buddha is embodiment of love, embodiment of compassion,

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.220
 embodiment of wisdom. We discover that.

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:51.530
 When we are our treasure, when we discover, that is what we also become. We will have that, really,

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:58.220
 too. Not when you can't have big emotions, arrogance, and this and that, all that.

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:08.100
 So humble, so practical, sensible, with full common senses. And so beautiful human beings, one of

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:14.880
 the beautiful, really simple human beings, all the sentient beings. That is the sign of the

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.220
 realization.

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:23.420
 Read the life story of those great masters, even the Buddha. When we read the life story of his

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:31.060
 teachings, Buddha is humble, how simple. And he was a royal teacher of so many kings and ministers,

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:32.220
 these people.

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:39.940
 But he didn't go on the golden chariot and walk on the street. I mean, going on the street. He

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:48.220
 choose to walk with hair on his bare feet, carrying his own belongings and holding his arms both.

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:57.830
 Arms and going with maksanga members. That's really true. And say on the vermitage, small vermitage

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:05.220
, we saw in the charastha, the located where the Buddha stayed. See, this is simple.

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:16.050
 Really, with God making us big, this and that. That's how the great teacher was, our great teacher.

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:21.220
 Our great teacher, who showed all these teachings, really, that's it.

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:33.200
 And then all these masters, with the life story of the Bhagavan bodhisattvas, that even in this

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:33.220
 lifetime, when you see his dhuniramud, they are so simple, really, so humble, simple.

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:39.830
 When you look to your being with his own dhuniramud, he just looks like a normal person. Normal,

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:44.220
 liberal person, not acting anything like this and that thing.

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:51.400
 And of course, we student, Osmane student, oh, he is this, this, that. That's it. That's the way

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:53.220
 the devotees told him.

00:07:53.220 --> 00:08:01.920
 But when he themselves, he did not act like that. Simple. And now this great teacher, such as his

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:05.220
 own dhuniramud, really, so simple.

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:12.100
 He often walked with his own, walked on the Bhagavan place, his own slippers, slippers, sandals,

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:16.220
 sandals, and simple robes. That is why.

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:27.630
 So, this is the relief. So, those are this. And now, as we see, so now we are going to do

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:28.220
 liberating techniques.

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:41.220
 Liberating techniques, as the great master said, now, liberating technique is here.
