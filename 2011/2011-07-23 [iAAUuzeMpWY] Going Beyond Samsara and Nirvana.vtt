00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.100
 This teacher with me follows, now the Oddiyana is no other than the mind. The meaning of the

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:17.900
 Oddiyana, the old meaning of the Oddiyana is, as I said yesterday, it has meaning, flying,

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:24.700
 flying and hovering, or flying and walking, walking. This is the true meaning, the old

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:30.300
 meaning of that. And then the meaning of what is standing for Oddiyana is the place where

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.340
 all the Vediyana teaching comes from, or most of the Vediyana teaching comes from. So that

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.980
 means many times known as the source of the Vediyana teaching or the secret teaching.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.980
 So in this case, the source of the secret teaching is no other than the mind. So Oddiya

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:55.980
 is standing for the mind itself. Mind is the source of everything, the source of the mantra,

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.980
 the mantra or the Vediya, and not just only that, this mind is the source of everything,

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:09.980
 both samsara and nirvana, everything. From within that status, and then what is there?

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:16.980
 Then it says, between the yachins of the west and the north, west and north stand as samsara

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:24.980
 and nirvana, we met yesterday. And then, so it is between samsara and nirvana. That means

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:30.480
 beyond the samsara and nirvana state is known as the great Maha Pari nirvana, or the great

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:37.980
 enlightened state is beyond the samsara, beyond the nirvana. You are not kind of sinking in

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:48.980
 the samsara, you know you are not stuck, stuck in the nirvana, as many great ahaas are, rest

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:54.980
 in the nirvana, nirvana in the kind of way. Everything is finished and exhausted and then

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:03.980
 in a way, almost like, just in a way, as I say, almost like a harpoonating status, harpoonating

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:10.980
 status. According to Mahayana teaching, this is not the finest goal. Because ahaada is

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:20.980
 not the finest goal, according to Mahayana, because they just only discover the emptiness

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:27.980
 of the egolessness. They still have to discover the nature of all phenomena, nature. So therefore,

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:34.980
 they just, in a way, rest in a way, in a way, they just rest in an area and in a way, they

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.980
 stay there. And that is in the teaching said, that is called lord of satara. Mahayana satara,

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:48.980
 lord of satara, in that satara said, this great ahaada says in that, this nirvana state

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:58.980
 is for ten eons, ten eons, and around, at the end of the ten eons, there is a great light

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.980
 comes from the buddha, buddhas. Great light comes, it's touched to those who are at the

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.980
 state of nirvana, their status, and then it wakes up, in a way, it brings up that. And

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:18.980
 in front of that light, it says, oh, this very resting is not the final goal. Still you

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:26.980
 should pursue, continually to get, continually pursue and become buddha, enlightenment. As

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.980
 they got that message in the teaching, and then they began to continually walk again,

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:41.980
 develop the bodhijata, and walk as with six params, and then reaching in, fully enlightenment.

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:50.980
 So that is what is like those ahasas. So in this case, nirvana is as like basic Buddhism,

00:03:50.980 --> 00:04:00.980
 nirvanas. And so, it is not stuck there, nirvana is not just only sattva, like, isolated from

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:07.980
 the samsara, and from the samsara challenge, and rest in the nirvana. So, therefore, it is

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:13.980
 this great nirvana, which is known as beyond the samsara, and beyond the nirvana, and that

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.980
 is indicated by some, the borderlines of the nirvana in the samsara. So it's not really

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:27.980
 the border itself, but it is beyond of the samsara and nirvanas. In that borderline,

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:37.980
 in that state, then who is residing? That is, who is residing is the Pima Kesa Dungpala.

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:44.980
 That's what the teacher said. Pima Kesa Dungpala is residing. What is Pima Kesa Dungpala?

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:53.980
 It is our authentic nature of the mind. Our authentic knowledge, which is often known

00:04:53.980 --> 00:05:04.980
 as Buddha nature, that Buddha nature is, is beyond the samsara and beyond the nirvana.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:13.980
 That is our innate nature. This innate nature of us, I say this, is the mostly nuclear wisdom,

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:20.980
 the primordial wisdom, powerful nuclear wisdom. That which is residing is beyond the samsara,

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:27.980
 is beyond the nirvana. It is not propagated by any circumstance of the cause and conditions.

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:35.980
 Therefore, it is self-born, the primordial wisdom. Therefore, it is always there.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:40.980
 This is known as in the Buddha's teaching, in January Buddha's teaching in Mahayana,

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:51.980
 the Buddha's nature. Because of having this nature, every living being,

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:58.980
 we all have the beautiful qualities. Qualities of such as love, kindness, compassion, intelligence,

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:05.980
 even we are covered by the midst of the, or with the heavy of the burden of the duality,

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:13.980
 but still the power of the hidden of Buddha nature or this self-born primordial is shining

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:21.980
 through the midst of this, the habitual thick clothes as sun, light penetrates.

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:27.980
 Even the heavy thick clothes, light penetrates and bring the daylight in the samsara.

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:35.980
 Similarly, this, here is the time in the samsara, still is continually guide.

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:44.370
 Because of this beautiful qualities, then we pursue, we walk for that, then we can become the

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:44.980
 Buddha.

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:52.980
 This is what the reason, that we can make a change, we can develop, we can remove and pacify,

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:57.980
 this temporarily arises, the thick clothes are bigger patterns.

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:04.980
 That's what the teaching said and that's what the witness by all these great masters.
