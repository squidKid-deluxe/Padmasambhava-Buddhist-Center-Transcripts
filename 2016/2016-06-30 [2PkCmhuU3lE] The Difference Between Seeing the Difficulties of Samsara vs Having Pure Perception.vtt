00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.580
 "In reality level, Samsaara is pure. Samsaara is pure because Samsaara is three Gaya status.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:21.090
 Three Gaya status or three Vedya status. So it's really reality pure. But yet, we don't have that

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.380
 realization now.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:30.770
 Therefore, to re-strengthen our realization, not caught by all the different hindrances in the sams

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:31.160
ara,

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:40.020
 then we reflect those poor inner session thoughts. So we are not just carried by the force of the

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.200
 emotions,

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.950
 so we reflect poor inner session of training of the mind. And such as then, also cultivate more

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.760
 love during application.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:56.530
 And those are the natures of the mind. Mind, so if we do those, cultivating those natures more and

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.920
 more,

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:04.800
 that will bring then our sagu more, more also, more calm, peaceful, joy, and more open mind.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:12.250
 And that will really help to support, to discover the ultimate level of three Gaya and three Vedya

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.300
 status."

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:28.290
 "So if you try to cultivate that pure view as more intellectual exercise, before we have enough rev

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.780
ulsion towards Samsaara, can we get in trouble?"

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:41.260
 "In worldly, again, there is a personal level, a world personal level, and as to how you are going

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.180
 to act in an open world,

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:51.500
 there is two things, personal level and the worldly or action to the world level.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:59.720
 Personal level, we should cultivate more about these pure perceptions, really as much as we can.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:06.860
 That will really benefit to us, it will help us. But in the samsara, in the world level, we should

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.240
 follow again exactly where things are happening.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:19.320
 Really clear understanding of the wisdom, view and bed, and supporting that, and supporting to that

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.820
 exactly where things are.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:26.810
 So that means accepting, trying to accept the good things, to do the good things, and trying also

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.520
 to eliminate the not good, good, and trying to do that.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.890
 So follow exactly where the things are. And so that's what we should act in the samsara level, or

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.660
 in the world.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:52.160
 Personal level, and in the outreaching level. Okay, sir. That clears. Then tell me one more.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:03:02.770
 Yeah, I guess sometimes we have such a wealth of profound depth of teachings on the purity of

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:10.660
 nature. But sometimes, me personally, I like the revulsion towards samsara.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:23.710
 Revulsion, right? I still like samsara. You like samsara. So do I need to focus more on more peer

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:32.160
 view? More what? More peer view.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:39.400
 I think maybe I need more revulsion toward samsara. Do you know what? Revulsion. Revulsion says, "

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.160
No, you don't need revulsion, samsara."

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.900
 "No, definitely in the Dzogki teaching, or in the Mahayana teaching." "We're not going to revolve

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.160
 into samsaras."

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.660
 "In the Hinayana teaching sometimes," he said, "but it's also not really revolve into samsara."

00:03:53.660 --> 00:04:00.280
 "But in the Mahayana teaching, we know the samsara, how we can develop the bodhicitta enlightenment

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.160
." "How we can develop, how we can practice the six paramatas."

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:11.040
 "I mean, samsara is our training ground." "We know the samsara, we're not going to train ourselves

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.660
."

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:17.970
 "So, we're not going to revolve into samsara." "In the Mahayana teaching, it is pure land. Pure

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.160
 land." "Therefore, again, we're not going to revolve."

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:27.690
 "Revolving is the very kind of like samsaric mind, and very low kind of like Buddha's teaching,

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.160
 maybe like I'm the beginner Buddha teaching."

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:41.210
 "That revolve in that is not taught." "Or revolve, okay, either way, either way, revolve, sometimes

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.660
 it is advanced, you know?" "Yes."

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:53.070
 "But revolve is also vomiting, or revolting." "No, samsara is not a revolting, but grasping,

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:59.660
 clinging, it makes a letter, what's it called? Letter vomiting."

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:07.110
 "Samsara, this grasp, clinging, it makes a letter, that we have to, whatever technique we can do,

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.660
 what are we trying to do there?"

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.980
 "That, remove the birth, samsara itself is not really revolting that, because this is Amnadryas

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.160
 yoga."

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:22.660
 "In the bodhisattva yana, this is the training ground." "Training ground, six paramatas."

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:28.230
 "And for that reason, what the guru of those great masters said, in the terms of the teaching

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:30.660
 enlightenment, who is kindness?"

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.660
 "Buddha or the samsara?"

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.660
 "In the teachings, they both are kindness."

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:41.430
 "Buddha shows the path, samsara, Buddha shows the technique, and the teaching, and samsara giving

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:42.660
 the technique."

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:50.670
 "Samsara or the sentence basically training, nugget training us, training us, that teaching we can

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:51.660
 apply."

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.660
 "Otherwise, how we can improve?"

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:58.660
 "So therefore, samsara is not revolting and not vomiting."

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:04.660
 "But however, if we reflect this thought, nugget training of mind, what it will does?"

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:11.660
 "It will settle us more calmly, beautifully, more become practicals."

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.660
 "More sensibles, more thoughtfuls, really it will make that true."

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:23.050
 "Our son, more break, that means, makes more break, our son, how break, how lucky, how important it

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:23.660
 is."

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:28.660
 "It really brings that attitude, attitude that understands."

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:36.660
 "So therefore, teaching said, reflect those teachings occasionally or every time, reflect those."

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.660
 "Every time of our practices."
