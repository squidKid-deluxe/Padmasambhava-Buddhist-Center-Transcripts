00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 Thank you, Rinpoche. I was wondering, Rinpoche, if you would give us a little more detailed

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.330
 instruction on how to do Tonglen practice and how to merge that or combine that with Dzogchen

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.000
 meditation.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 "Tonglen" practices and that is, I mean, "Tonglen" in the Tibetan word "Tonglen" which means "Tong"

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 means giving, "Ling" means receiving, so that is the word meaning of "Tonglen".

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 Now, what you do is then you are giving your joy, peace, happiness or healing energy to the others.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.700
 If we have anyone that is designated or particular to focus, think of that person and then as well

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.000
 as every living.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.520
 There is money, similar big street. That person is not just alone, there are so many, even though

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.000
 we don't know, but there is so many and as well as everyone.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:20.120
 So really we kind of think every that way and so we give them our healing energy, all the good

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:27.590
 deeds and all that and then whatever they are suffering and having difficulties and you taking that

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.000
 in, in and giving that, that.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 So that is really known as "Tonglen" practices. "Tonglen" practice.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 Where you do this is the great Master Puthavadhi.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 He said, very famous Kadampa Master, Aditya disciples said that you do that with breathing.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:55.130
 When you do exhale, you take all the joy, healing energy and power that what you have or your merit

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.000
 really sending out, out to give it that.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.040
 When you inhale, then you are taking all those difficulties, troubles, whatever that is, through

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.000
 your power of compassion, loving kindness that you are taking in that.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 So that is really basically "Tonglen" practices.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.460
 When you do these things, then maybe do that five minutes, ten minutes, whatever you do, after that

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:30.220
, then go to the zoki level, zoki level, then same thing meditating and meditating and relaxing our

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.000
 mind in a natural state.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 So that means who is doing that? Who is doing that?

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:45.110
 Your two. Subject and object activates all emptiness. There is nothing really substantial, solid,

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.000
 existing, that conquered, existing.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.830
 All is illusion. That all started from your mind and then mind is empty and then relaxing in that

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.000
 natural state.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:04.290
 The state is without any conceptual thought, this and that thing. So that is like zoki, resting

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.000
 your mind in a zoki state at the end or the final state.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 And with the visualization, is the breath a certain color or how do we visualize the beings?

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:26.830
 I didn't really show or I didn't heard from the great masters any particularly colors and that when

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:32.000
 we do the exchanging or this "Tonglen" practices that is not that ideal.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:40.160
 So I am also really happy to think. I mean, many great masters said that we like to highlight

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:46.400
 someone that is then individually that kind of like really setting your energy and breath with the

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.000
 breathings.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 With the breathings to that person, all illnesses have to use the breathing.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.750
 Just think, send that to that individually, remove that kind of immediately, that kind of ease

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.000
 their troubles.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 And same time you are taking in that to you. So then this troubles out of the suffering difficulty.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.230
 Plus then we hold, because extending the both each other, all the sentient beings preform that

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:13.000
 suffering.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.140
 And then in the deep down breathing system, only the cause of those troubles made that never came

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.000
 out and completely removed.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.810
 And cause of those troubles of the suffering, when Buddha told the suffering truth, cause of

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.000
 suffering truth, then what is the cause of suffering?

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 Suffering. Cause of suffering is the karma and the emotions.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 Karma and the emotions, those are known as the cause of suffering truth.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 And what is caused by the karma then is emotion. So deep down is negative emotion.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 Negative emotion is really the cause of our activities.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 And then suffering is unkindly, unpresent. Therefore that cause must be unpresent.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 And therefore what is that cause? Is that negative emotion? Anger, attachment, or combination? Of

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 course anger is there.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:13.510
 So that is, so which really that also goes away. Those are really kind of extended thoughts and I

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:15.000
 think that's it.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 Thank you.
