00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 This is the Mahayana, according to the Mahayana Buddha's life stories.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.550
 There is a parabola, Buddha's life story. The Mahayana Buddha's life story is generally basically

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:16.000
 the same.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 But the Mahayana Buddha's life story is best or the same as the 12 deeds.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 The 12 deeds are more detailed and more familiar. This is the Buddha's life story of the Mahayana.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 It is known as Lalitavasra. In Sanskrit, I will see what this is here.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 This is a very good gesture of Lalitavasra.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 And what this is? I am sorry you don't release this.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:26.780
 Anyway, it is very, very good. The Kangyu has made over 100 volumes, and this is in the Sutra

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.000
 section, Mahayana Sutra section, and it is the second volume.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:41.210
 And the way the Buddha taught this teaching is he taught this teaching at the Shavastha and the J

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.000
ada of Groves.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:02:00.610
 He taught this, and it has about eight books or eight chapters, so it is really eight chapters or

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:01.000
 bigger than that.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 And who translated is again the time of the 'Gurupan Mahsambhana'.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 Nana Shela and Muney Varma, and the great translator, Pende Ishide, who is one of the 25 disciples,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 who is flying or hovering in the sky as a bird.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 I think this one up on the top, really. This is I think Ishide, so he is a very famous translator.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 He is the only translator, so many teaching of this great master.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:03:00.350
 So, that is it. But now, go to the trace of what I said. So, now, Buddha, firstly, Buddha is in the

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.000
 Tushida heaven, known as Dhambatoka in Tibet,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 and the supreme holder of the crown jewel. I think maybe that is the name, Dhambatoka.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:24.910
 And then, he was teaching in the Tushida heaven, so many gods and males and females, and everyone

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.000
 is enjoying.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:33.820
 But on the music, on the music song, when they are playing the music, song that comes to Dhambatoka

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:34.000
,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 now is your time to go to the human world to benefit, help with that.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 So, you must be considering to think of the human world. That came in the music world.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:58.020
 They are playing the music songs. So, then, because of those indications, Dhambatoka appointed his

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.000
 regent or his regent as Buddha material,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:10.210
 the Bodhisattva material, as the teacher of the Tushida heaven, and he put his crown over the

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:11.000
 material,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 and now, I will go to the human world to help.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 And then, every god, everyone says, "Where you go, human world, where you will go?

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 Which country? Where are you thinking at all?" Everyone has so many different opinions.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 You should go. And what kind of parent you should take? Everyone, yeah, really has.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 And then, particularly in India at that time, or not that time, it's still true now,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 there are very few, six civilized countries, and all these different kingdoms.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:55.150
 Those are known as the Varanasi is one, and the Sharasala is one, and then in the Koshambha is one,

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.000
 and there is called Nipi,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:06.700
 I think Sankheda area, which is Indian called Sankheda, and then Vaishali, India, and then Raji

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.000
 Green, and all that.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 So, there are different, really, kind of rulers, very civilized, according to the teaching.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 Very prospheric, very peaceful, very low of the orders, cultures, music, dance,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.570
 and then all the, really, theatres and performances, that is like modern times, according to the

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:27.000
 teaching, so much.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 And also, they have distinctively cultural differences, kind of rules and regulations.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 So, all the gods, if you choose to go to India, which country you will go?

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.380
 Sankheda is good to go to the Raji Green, that which is very kind of being civilized country, kind

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.000
 known as Bhimati.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 And Sankheda is a present, you know, kind of father, his father is a Kiarastha god, these things.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.550
 So, then Bodhisattva, who is now a Bodhisattva ambatoga, who is going to become the Buddha Shakyam

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:59.000
uni,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.680
 he looked everywhere, places, and of course, he knew already where he'd like to go to, to beat that

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:06.000
.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 And he looked at everyone, and all his great country, beautiful civilized country, everything,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 but not perfect to be as the parent of the Buddha himself, she understood.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 So, he saw that his mother, the particular father of course, Shuddhodan, and the mother Maya Devi,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 and the mother Maya Devi, he saw the perfect mother, perfect mother,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 the perfect college of the great ladies, ladies, and beautiful, calm, peaceful, very generous,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 the open mind, yet so deep and like calm, and all the perfect, and beauty, and knowledge,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:54.580
 and understand every aspect of the, that the human being can have, and also particularly woman can

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:55.000
 have.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 He has all those qualities, and so virtuous, and so good. So, he is the designated mother.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 So, those are the kind of simple way to tell it.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 And now, so now, the Buddha came in the form of the, everyone said,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 how now you're going to enter the Maya Devi's womb, one we choose.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.490
 Everyone said these and their things, but all Buddha thought that I'm going to benefit for all the

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:24.000
 beings,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 and I'm going to go to the womb as ancient Brahma Indian,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 what they called best way to enter the mother's womb.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:44.200
 And they used ancient Brahma, they said the child or the person who had the capability to enter the

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:45.000
 mother's womb,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 really six task elephant, three task here, three task here, six task white elephant,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:02.000
 those, that person who have their capabilities, that person will become very noble.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:11.540
 They divine that child. So, they used that, and so Buddha transformed in the form of the white

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:12.000
 elephant,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 with six task, and all the gods and everyone is making such a big celebration of honor,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:27.000
 and the Buddha entered the green Maya Devi's womb, on the full moon days.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 And so now, Buddha entered, and he also, Mother dreamed the same thing.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 Same thing, six task elephant with beautiful jewel and only entered to the mother, to her king,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 came to her.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:49.500
 He dreamed, and then she said those dream to her, her husband, who is the king, he showed up, said

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:50.000
 this.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:57.000
 And they were very delighted. This is the only son of them, they had not had any child,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:04.000
 and they really expected to have the son or the child they had for a long time.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 So, this time, like all those indications come, she is so excited, Father is so excited,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 so excited, so happy, and everything is so, they kept perfectly beautiful to the mother,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:22.000
 exactly in the teaching, always they said, not too cold, that that pregnant lady should stay,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 not too cold, not too hard, and very cool, pleasant. That lady also should not hurt any unpleasant

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 things,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 kind of always nice and beautiful. So, according to the season, he will have everything,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:43.000
 the food is also not too hot, not too sweet, not too sour, kind of nice balance of the food,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 and all those teachings, so they did everything, everything they did.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.000
 And she was also so calm and physical, particularly she already calm and physical,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:58.650
 when Buddha, she considered that Buddha, and she becomes so calm, so physical, so happy, so blessed

00:09:58.650 --> 00:09:59.000
,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:06.000
 and also her body become light, starts heavy, all the dark, and light, and all that.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:14.000
 So, now, the Buddha, according to the teaching, Buddha stayed in the womb 10 months, 10 months.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 So, now is the dude, kind of coming, Buddha is coming, coming, so what is this now?

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:31.000
 So, now Buddha is, Buddha is coming here.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 What is this now?

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 Now Buddha is really, and when Buddha is again, concept in that time,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 generally, there is so many beautiful ajpichas, extra ordinary, kind of like natural occurrence

 So many beautiful things happened, and there is, there is like 30, I mean 32 different omens,

 Happened, and then also many kind of musical things, the pregnant thing, all that happened,

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:24.000
 and beautiful, and just say every arrangement, they did, so that's what, and that moment

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 when she's arrived there, there, and moment she arrived there, and now she feels that

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 she's going to give the birth, and when he arrived there, there's so many beautiful trees,

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 so many in the Lumbini tree, but one tree is standing so kind of like, totally, or totally,

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 or I'm standing in notice of the body, and it's kind of like mostly inviting the Queen Maya

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:08.000
 to come to that tree, and in a way, extending the branches toward her, toward her,

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 and the area is also so beautiful, it's so green, green and vast in space,

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:23.000
 and all the grass looks like shimmering with light as pickled feathers, pickled feathers,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 and also very smooth and gentle that it is, and then that moment, the gods in the sky

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:38.000
 started singing the songs, songs, and this, that is the song, and they're singing the song,

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:46.330
 and they're bowing down toward that tree, and so she came, she came to that tree, and when that

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:47.000
 happened,

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 and trees also bowing down to the Queen Maya Davis, Queen Maya, in the way of King Maya Davis,

00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 and so, and Maya Davis kind of extended her right arm, kind of as a lightening to that kind of like

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:09.000
,

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 binding or the tree trunks up, limbs right, limbs are mostly binding toward her,

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:26.530
 and she also extended, so they kind of immediately just touched to each other, or welcomed to each

00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:27.000
 other,

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 like a right hand, and that moment that desire them, so many goddess came to Maya Davis,

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:54.000
 and they began to respect it to her, and then, and then so many again, beautiful things happened,

00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:03.320
 beautiful things happened, and then that moment Buddha came, Buddha was born, came without any kind

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:04.000
 of effect,

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:14.000
 or the, or the, any, any kind of defect of that, just so alert, so mindful, so clear,

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 and without any, that he came, and that moment, moment, again the Buddha is saying,

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 "Oh, all the noble, noble, noble students, that time when I came at that moment,

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:37.000
 moment King of the Indira, the King of the God Indira, and as well as the Brahman,

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 they both are right in front of you, they both are, both as divine white cloth,

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:54.490
 where is, like divine white cloth, so close, so close, that will, that will completely cover his

00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:55.000
 body,

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:04.000
 and they try to, they pick up, pick up that, pick up them, pick up the Buddha, baby Buddha.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:20.000
 And so when they're trying to pick up that, and some others, Sutra said,

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:26.650
 and Buddha said, immediately called to Indira, Kaushaka is the name of the, another name of the Ind

00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:27.000
ira,

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:35.000
 and Kaushaka, don't touch me, don't touch me, and he said that, and he walked seven steps,

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:45.000
 each direction, directions, and here also Sutra, moment I was born, and I, I walked, I walked,

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:51.000
 walked, and as like, I walked to the, looked to different directions,

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:58.000
 and another king, known as Gavu, in a near Gavu, they all appeared, appeared in the sky,

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 and they showered me, really, really cool and, and warm waters,

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:17.830
 and then, as well as many guards, and also showered, and so many plovers are dropped in the sky, on

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:19.000
 the ground,

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:25.550
 and so many, pretty much he won't go there, and then, so, I walked seven steps in the different

00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:26.000
 directions,

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:37.000
 or different directions, then I, sitting on the lotus, lotus, with a so-called number,

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 and looking in the four different directions, as lines get in the gates of the fearlessness,

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:57.750
 and, and that moment, also that everyone, all the people who see me, saw, saw the baby body, Buddha

00:22:57.750 --> 00:22:58.000
,

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:05.000
 Buddha, they had, they also immediately able to maintain perfect morality, perfect concentration,

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:22.000
 perfect also, wisdom status, status, status, and, and so, they again, I'm here, so here,

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:32.000
 and, and, and really, also Buddha is, the baby Buddha is completely alert and clay in the wisdom,

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:40.000
 and so, therefore, with that, with that, and say that, every activity I will do,

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.000
 all will come with the bodhisattva activity, or the bodhisattva activities,

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:52.000
 that is the, every activity, activity, or every action I take, that will do.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:58.000
 He said that, and walked in the toward the east direction, seven steps,

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:15.000
 and then he walked to the, the, the sort of directions, and I will be the, the, I will be the,

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:26.000
 I will be the, the object of venerations of the gods and humans, humans, and walked the seven steps

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:26.000
,

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:32.000
 and the seven steps, walked in the west direction, I am the supreme in the samsaras,

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:38.000
 and, and the west, and the seven steps, walked on the north, and he said,

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 this is my last birth, getting old, sicknesses, and death, death,

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:54.000
 and I will defeat all of them, he said, and then, and, and I will be the,

00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:01.000
 the supreme teacher in the human world, said, and walked seven steps in the northern directions,

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:10.830
 and I will remove all the obstacles and negativities, and I will, that cool down all the lower revs

00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:12.000
, lower revs,

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:18.000
 and he said, and he walked the different directions again, and walked, he looked upward,

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:24.000
 or I, Buddha looked almost, I mean, this is the Buddha's teaching, so he said, I looked up the

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:24.000
 world,

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:32.460
 that I will, well, every living beings to the enlightenment stages, sit there, and he looked up to

00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:33.000
 the sky,

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:39.530
 and the moment he's met those statements, means, and that kind of heard by all, every different

00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:40.000
 directions,

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:49.000
 every different directions, and then, all that, everyone is also very excited, happy to see, see,

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:56.500
 see, and to me, or to baby Buddha, and then they started playing, dancing, and singing, and all

00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:57.000
 that,

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.000
 so that is my brief story, it's about the world today.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:11.000
 Thank you. Okay, this is really more, this is the more things, all this, so, that's it.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 Yeah, I think that's the, that's the, kind of, just the birthday section, so that, according,

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:30.600
 according to very Buddhism, that happened today. According to very, kind of, and then according to

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:31.000
 Therapada,

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:41.020
 that happened last month, they're all in one same day, in which the full moon, birthday, in that

00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:43.000
 enlightenment,

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:49.000
 Mahaparin nirvana, all is, I think, in the same day, the full moon, but the beginning is,

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:55.000
 today is the birthday, and next week, I think it's Tuesday, right? Next Tuesday is the full moon,

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:02.000
 and that is the enlightenment in Mahaparin nirvana. And then, everything, also carefully,

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:09.000
 Buddha said, like, what's called, twelve deeds. Twelve deeds, and what are those, twelve deeds?

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:22.300
 Entering the mother's womb, taking the birth, and then starting, and then wedding, and then ren

00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:23.000
ouncing,

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:33.000
 and then asatic practices, and then walking toward the body, to the enlightenment,

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:39.000
 and then sitting under the body trees, and getting, or defeating all the obstacles,

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:45.000
 and then getting enlightenment, and then turning the veil of dharma, and turning the Mahaparin nir

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:45.000
vana,

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:52.000
 those are the, are the twelve deeds, I think. Among that, so really, if you think carefully,

00:27:52.000 --> 00:28:01.490
 this, this next week, next week, is one of the, one of the twelve deeds is walking toward the body

00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:02.000
 tree.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:11.110
 That also happening next week. And then also, defeating all the mārās, that also happening on

00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:12.000
 that full moon.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:18.000
 That is one of the twelve deeds. And then getting enlightenment, of course, that.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:24.250
 So this is, many times they say, like, very special day of the birth, among all the twelve

00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:25.000
 activities,

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:33.500
 the Buddha did, like, three is manual, but the two others, in all that way, Buddha really did more

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:35.000
 than three,

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:41.000
 five, I think, all did is happen on this month. So therefore, this month is considered

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:46.000
 in one of the very special months of the virtues, to do the virtues activity.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:50.000
 It multiplies, like, hundreds and hundreds of thousand times.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:56.000
 They call it teaching, really. That's it. Thank you. Thank you, Ramachand. Thank you.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 Mucho gracias. And now, Andy, come here.
