NOTE     "description": "Main Topics Being Discussed\n \n1. \"All beings have the potential for buddhahood. In order to actualize this potential we need to meditate. The best supports for meditation practice are (1) joyful effort, (2) mindfulness, (3) devotion, (4) concentration, and (5) wisdom. The Buddha taught that we can actualize enlightenment with these five supports.\" (pg 65, 1st paragraph)\n\n(1) Joyful Effort\nWhen you meditate, first you need to apply joyful and continuous effort. In any activity you need a certain amount of motivation to finish what you start. If you experience joy in what you are doing, then you will want to continue. ... The opposite of joyful effort is laziness, or feeling dull and heavy. (pg 65, 2nd paragraph, pg 69 1st full paragraph)\n\n(2) Mindfulness\nFor whatever amount of time you meditate, even for five or ten minutes, try to maintain your mind single-pointedly, without being distracted by thoughts. ... Mindfulness means paying attention to the main focus of the meditation as well as to the supports of devotion, effort, concentration, and so forth. Mindfulness means not forgetting what you are doing, but being clear and focused. ... The opposite of mindfulness is forgetfulness. Forgetfulness happens because the mind is moving so fast. The mind is somewhat like a strainer that cannot keep water from flowing out. (pg 66, 1st full paragraph, pg 69 2nd full paragraph)\n\n(3) Devotion\nDevotion to the highly realized beings such as Buddha Shakyamuni, Guru Padmasambhava, or Tara means that you feel close to them and wish to attain the same ability they have to help all sentient beings. Devotion is feeling great interest in their realization and longing to have the same realization as soon as you can. ... The opposite of devotion is the absence of interest and clear thinking about spiritual practice. People who lack devotion see only the ordinary objects right in front of them; their vision of the deeper levels of reality is obscured. (pg 66, 3nd full paragraph, pg 68 last paragraph)\n\n(4) Concentration\nConcentration means continually maintaining an unmoving focus. ... Generally, our minds are darting about and unstable. Concentration naturally brings calmness and peace of mind. ... The opposite of concentration is distraction. (pg 67, last paragraph, pg 68 1st paragraph, and pg 69, last paragraph)\n\n(5) Wisdom\nThe fifth power, wisdom, naturally emerges from practicing the first four powers. One way to understand wisdom is to divide it into its two aspects, relative and absolute. ... Relatively, we directly perceive objects through seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, and touching. We apply inference when we think about them. These are aspects of relative wisdom. When we examine phenomena closely, we see that they exist in an illusory way, like a mirage, a dream, or the reflection of the moon in water. Recognition of the illusory nature of phenomena is absolute wisdom. ... The opposite of wisdom is ignorance. ... Ignorance is like the darkness caused by wearing a hat that completely covers our head so that we cannot see anything. (pg 68, 1st and 2nd full paragraphs, pg 70 1st full paragraph)\n\nImportant Concepts and Terms\n\njoyful effort [Tib. tsondru,  Skt. Virya]. We train in the paramita of joyful effort to combat all modes of laziness and self-satisfaction. The Sanskrit word virya refers to the kind of effort that is ongoing, diligent, enthusiastic, and dedicated to the well-being of others. With virya, bodhisattvas cultivate the energy necessary to care for limitless \nsentient beings.\n\nThe three categories of effort are (A) unflinching courage, (B) insatiable effort, and (C) unceasing effort.\n\n(A) Unflinching courage is necessary to confront the immensity of the bodhisattva's task. Sentient beings are infinite in number\u2014our joyful effort must extend to each one of them without becoming overwhelmed or discouraged.\n\n(B) We often feel that we have done enough and are quite self-satisfied when we achieve even the slightest spiritual realization, or we manage to help just a few other beings. Until all beings have been brought to the state of complete enlightenment, we must exert ourselves with energy that is never diminished by self-satisfaction or the thought that we have done enough and that's it.\n\n(C) If we have developed unflinching courage and diligence that is never satisfied, we will work day and night to accomplish the benefit of all sentient beings. Our effort will be enthusiastic, joyful, and unceasing.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.600
 Hello, welcome to the 13th recording of the "PVC Morning Gone" webcast from Padmasamy

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:13.780
 Ling, Kebur-Rimchase Mama Steering Retreat Center in New York. Today we'll be discussing

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:20.760
 the 13th chapter of Rimchase books called "The Buddhist Path", which is known as "The

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.000
 Five Supports of Meditation". So we'll begin with our usual opening prayers, and then we'll

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 go to the discussion. Thanks so much!

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 I pray. The supreme tradition of the glorious Buddha Bhagmasambhava, which is the essential

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.980
 extraordinary view and doctrine of the early translation school, may keep alive and spread

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:32.200
 by the light of wisdom. Lord of Dharma, great Hempo, I pray at your lotus feet. In the palace

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.320
 of the oatman Dharmadattu, the essence of all the Buddhas of the three times, the one who

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.320
 shows clearly the Dharmakaya of my own mind, you pray to the honorable root guru, glorious

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.720
 fruit teacher, precious one, dwelling on the lotus seed and the crown of my head. Hold me

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:55.720
 with your great kindness, bestow the accomplishments of body, speech and mind.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:42.420
 To begin this chapter 13, which starts on page 65 of the Buddhist Path, I'll give a

 and we'll go to the next half of this chapter,

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:42.860
 and we'll go to the next half of this chapter,

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:44.860
 and we'll go to the next half of this chapter,

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:46.860
 and we'll go to the next half of this chapter,

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:48.860
 and we'll go to the next half of this chapter,

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:50.860
 and we'll go to the next half of this chapter,

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:52.860
 and we'll go to the next half of this chapter,

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:54.860
 and that's maybe a little bit obvious,

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:58.860
 but so they describe joyful efforts as something

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:04.860
 that needs to be ideally slow and kind of steady like a river,

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:08.860
 and then the second one, mindfulness,

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:12.860
 they said that generally our mind is moving so fast

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:14.860
 and it has the monkey mind,

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:19.860
 so how do we get from, if we do have that monkey mind,

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:24.860
 how do we get to a place where we can cultivate this slow

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:29.860
 and steady joyful effort so that we can get on the cushion

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:34.860
 and engage in these five aspects of meditation?

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:48.860
 I think it had a lot to do with just getting that physical support,

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:52.860
 just actually giving yourself the time to be on the cushion.

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:56.860
 I particularly remember the first couple,

00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:01.860
 the few times that I sat down and just stripped,

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:04.860
 just kind of watching your breath, meditation,

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:08.860
 and it's kind of, it's really painful in that way of,

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:12.860
 "Wow, I didn't realize how much I was kind of woo."

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:17.860
 All over the place, or like other times you sit down

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:19.860
 and within the range of like 20 minutes

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:24.860
 you can watch this just whole like drama of emotions

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:27.860
 just completely erupt, and it's definitely,

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:33.860
 or just having that physical, having that commitment,

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:38.860
 "I'm going to sit, I'm going to let all of this erupt

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:41.860
 for the next at least 20 minutes,

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:43.860
 and I'm going to keep sitting with it."

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:45.860
 You make that commitment.

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:49.860
 I find that the physical support is one of those things that's,

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:52.860
 I mean, well, absolutely there's so many teachings

00:11:52.860 --> 00:12:00.860
 that need to be applied, but I think having that commitment,

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:03.860
 taking that time to give yourself that physical support

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:09.860
 and setting aside that time is what comes to mind for me.

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:16.860
 And it seems like too, once we give ourselves the opportunity,

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:19.860
 we have the vision of the teachings and what we're doing,

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:22.860
 and we actually begin to experience, like you mentioned,

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:27.860
 when we start to sit down and then the spotlight kind of shines

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:30.860
 and we see more clearly how busy and wild

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:34.860
 and kind of flitting our minds can be,

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:39.860
 but then not to be discouraged by that,

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:41.860
 but to know that that's part of the process

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:47.860
 and keep that wider vision of what's really keeping our goal in mind

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:50.860
 and keeping so many different supports.

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:52.860
 I mean, all of these are supports for the meditation,

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:56.860
 but also just the presence and the blessings of the Buddhas

00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:00.860
 and the Bhusattvas and remembering our teachers

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:04.860
 and all these beautiful examples that we can see

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:07.860
 just kind of in the relationship of that,

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:10.860
 what we might be aware of, how wild our mind is.

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:14.860
 Because I think for that, then that is also letting us see long-term,

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:17.860
 not just like right now how we're feeling,

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:22.860
 but seeing over a period of time what our goal is

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:26.860
 and looking at the examples of the great lineage masters

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:30.860
 and seeing what they've gone through in their lives.

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:32.860
 So it's not like these little things come up,

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:36.860
 whether they're inside feelings or outside uncomfortableness,

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:41.860
 but that kind of long-term vision from now until enlightenment,

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:46.860
 and seeing that and that kind of thing.

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:48.860
 That balance between...

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:51.860
 I think what you're getting at is that balance

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:55.860
 of seeing how wild and active our mind is

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:59.860
 and bursting forth, but then kind of how Rinpoche's here,

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:01.860
 as far as your joyful effort,

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:05.860
 are kind of emphasizing keeping that long-term.

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:10.860
 Long-term goal, long-term vision, really big vision,

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:13.860
 not only thinking of ourselves but all the beings

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:19.860
 and just always trying to maintain for the long run our practice.

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:23.860
 It's like maybe if you think about an example like in a marathon

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:26.860
 or something, if we've never run a marathon

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:30.860
 and we decide we're going to train to jog or something

00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:32.860
 or lift weights or you know what I mean?

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:36.860
 And we just go out and we run as fast as we can,

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:39.860
 as hard as we can, and we've never done it before,

00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:41.860
 we're not going to get very far,

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:43.860
 and we might be discouraged and just drop it.

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:46.860
 But keeping that long-term vision and being real

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:48.860
 about our current capacities

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:50.860
 but keeping our aspiration wide,

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:55.860
 it seems like that's a big part of that balance.

00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:58.860
 I think working with your breath is really helpful

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:01.860
 because it's very simple, it's always there,

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:04.860
 and there's a relationship between your breathing

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:07.860
 and how restless your mind is.

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:10.860
 So I find for myself that it's really useful

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:14.860
 to account or be aware of my breathing.

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:22.860
 It seems like too that just like both of you also

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:27.860
 but like Lotro said too, that just actually sit, you know?

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:32.860
 Just sit down, you know, in a place

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:34.860
 because these five things,

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:39.860
 it's an interesting dichotomy between having so many thoughts

00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:42.860
 and being distracted, and then there's so many aspects

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:46.860
 and there's so many devotion and all these other things

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:49.860
 and it can seem so big, I think, to some people,

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:52.860
 or at least to me, I know that I can have that.

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:56.860
 Just a lot of like, there's a whole package that goes with it,

00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:59.860
 but sometime I think if that is the case,

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:04.860
 or I find that with myself, even just to just sit down

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:06.860
 and then my mind naturally, you know,

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:09.860
 it's like that's part of it.

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:13.860
 Sometime that's even the hardest thing, just I mean for--

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:14.860
 - Just to start.

00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:17.860
 - Just to start, just to sit.

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:20.860
 Just to sit.

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:22.860
 - And I think it's good to remember

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:24.860
 all this is just a gradual process.

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:26.860
 Like it's kind of in one way, it's like,

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:28.860
 what other choice do we have?

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:30.860
 What have we ever experienced in this life

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:33.860
 that we just got instantly and we are perfect at it, you know?

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:37.860
 It's all gradual, all, any training takes time.

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:40.860
 And then what other option do we have that deal with our own mind?

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:42.860
 Every minute we have our mind.

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:46.860
 There's nothing we can do to not have our mind right now.

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:49.860
 So that's just like a straightforward teaching in the Buddha,

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:52.860
 like we always have this mind every instant.

00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:56.860
 We have to deal with it at some point if we want to feel better,

00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:58.860
 if we don't want to go through so much trouble.

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:03.860
 And then at the same time, like we're not just this tight racing mind,

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:07.860
 like it goes to this point of joyful effort.

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:10.860
 This type of laziness we have where we're self-defeating

00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:14.860
 because we don't really pay attention to the goodness qualities we have.

00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:18.860
 We only see the superficial surface level things.

00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:21.860
 And so we just say, oh, I'm no good, can't do,

00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:24.860
 or oh, this is too hard, or I'm too busy.

00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:26.860
 A big point of joyful effort is seeing that we,

00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:30.860
 it's not just this tight grasping mind we have,

00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:33.860
 but there is this deeper nature, this Buddha nature,

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:36.860
 like it's the first line of the chapter.

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:38.860
 All beings have the potential for Buddhahood.

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:41.860
 In order to actualize this potential, we need to meditate.

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:43.860
 Like it's all about revealing that nature.

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:47.860
 So the view is all in the sense of we're revealing that nature.

00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:49.860
 So to some degree we have to connect,

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:52.860
 we have to realize I have a mind happening now.

00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:56.860
 And there is some degree of being able to change what my mind does.

00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:59.860
 And there's this deeper level of awareness or of goodness,

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:03.860
 of heartfelt ability that we have,

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:06.860
 that when we tap into it again and again,

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:09.860
 then we can grow it.

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:13.860
 We can reveal it more, however we put that.

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:17.860
 And then trying to say, okay, well, how do I do that?

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:20.860
 I have to calm down first, to get a posture,

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:23.860
 I have to breathe all these other things that Rama Chas have outlined

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:25.860
 in these previous chapters.

00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:27.860
 And then I have to, well, what is my mind doing in practice?

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:29.860
 And here are the points.

00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:32.860
 What's the motivation? What's the technique?

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:33.860
 Am I doing the technique?

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:36.860
 Am I doing it with a tight grasping mind?

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:38.860
 Or am I doing it more with a wisdom mind?

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:42.860
 Like it's more or less, it's a framework for how to,

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:46.860
 in a session or in our daily lives, approach.

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:48.860
 That's the mindfulness aspect.

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:51.860
 Yeah, I mean the mindfulness is what am I doing right now?

00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:54.860
 What's happening right now?

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:57.860
 Anchoring it in this present moment of awareness,

00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:00.860
 because that's where we always are.

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:05.860
 I mean it's not, you know, it's profound.

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:11.860
 Like this one, I mean a point that really struck me in this chapter was,

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:16.860
 I think it was also later on in the chapter about,

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:20.860
 it was also related to this joyful effort, this laziness.

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:23.860
 We need to really make a, I mean it struck me,

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:28.860
 make a strong impression of our minds and what is meaningful to me?

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:31.860
 What is meaningful to me? What is the main thing?

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:34.860
 Where is my main overarching goal, like Lai was saying?

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:40.860
 Large view, in my life, what do I really want to do with my life?

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:46.860
 To really make that a repeated impression, like a strong pattern in the mind.

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:50.860
 Like and that's a joyful effort and that's an awareness, mindfulness,

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:55.860
 am I connecting to that deeper meaning in my life?

00:19:55.860 --> 00:20:00.860
 With my family and with my time and job and practice?

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:05.860
 Because without that, we're all just going to get swarmed and overwhelmed

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:10.860
 with all the everything that happens in a life, in a day.

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:15.860
 But that deep, like really trying to connect to that naturalness of ourselves

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:19.860
 with that really, what are we really kind of trying to refresh again and again?

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:22.860
 What do I want to do with today?

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:24.860
 Where am I going to kind of try to aim my life?

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:31.860
 And then in that context, this brings on much kind of deeper,

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:44.860
 deeper sense of wanting to understand it and try to apply it to.

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:45.860
 It's tough, you know.

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:50.860
 Seeing this as like a bag of techniques or like it's like a big jumble of things is hard.

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:53.860
 Like that's why we're so fortunate with Kemper Rinpoche's and Mipham Rinpoche,

00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:56.860
 all these lineage masters like Shampo and Guru Rinpoche and Buddha.

00:20:56.860 --> 00:21:01.860
 I mean, so many lineage masters have distilled these essential study points

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:05.860
 and essential practice points in a way that doesn't leave anything out,

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:07.860
 but we just have to apply them.

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:11.860
 These are like Rinpoche's have said, like with Samayas or Vinaya.

00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:16.860
 They're just guidelines, these expert tips that these realized beings are like,

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:22.860
 "I know you might not believe me now, but do these three things

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:27.860
 and it'll really help everything." And that's that devotion of like

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:32.860
 trying to just take their advice more than our own personal monkey mind,

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:37.860
 little individualistic, narcissistic, arrogant, short-term,

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:40.860
 ordinary object focused awareness.

00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:46.860
 Like what are the people with the like master view, what did they say?

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:48.860
 And what did they realize too?

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:52.860
 Like that, I mean, of course, but that aspect of devotion,

00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:57.860
 how we've talked about effort and being really that mindfulness and vigilance,

00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:03.860
 but then also with that, that balance of devotion is not separate from those things.

00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:06.860
 But I don't know, in my experience, it seems like too,

00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:11.860
 devotion has that aspect where with our joyful effort and with our mindfulness,

00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:16.860
 or like looking at, you know, the qualities of Buddha Dhammasanga, you know,

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:23.860
 of the lineage masters and everything, then there's that inspiration to our mind,

00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:30.860
 but there's also a certain level where we just have that natural part of the path

00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:34.860
 that's just soft-hearted and just like opening,

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:40.860
 like just being open and receptive to something beyond that we feel so close

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:43.860
 in our heart and like we recognize so deep in our heart,

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:51.860
 but like we're at the same time able to maybe drop some of our harder habitual

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:57.860
 patterns and things that maybe block that either conceptually or on whatever levels.

00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:00.860
 Like the way, I don't know, the way that part of devotion,

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:05.860
 the part of devotion that's the, you know, that adoration and the longing

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:09.860
 and that openness and closeness feeling where we can relax,

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:13.860
 it's like as much as it's so warm and rising and like longing,

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:18.860
 it's also that sense of like warmth and openness and like relaxing too

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:24.860
 and like being at ease and like that's like very, it's very dynamic too.

00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:28.860
 It's, you know, but I mean, there's so many aspects to devotion,

00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:32.860
 but it seems especially that part of how it really opens us to the blessings.

00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:40.860
 It helps us expand, you know, a kind of more contracted sense of who we are

00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:44.860
 and what our potential is, you know.

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:49.860
 It can help, you know, just really give more breath and space to recognize,

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:55.860
 you know, maybe help where mistakes we're making as well as like affirming

00:23:55.860 --> 00:24:01.860
 in those inner goodness qualities too by seeing them, you know, in others

00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:05.860
 and just, it's more the same.

00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:10.860
 It's interesting that you bring up the multiple facets of devotion.

00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:15.860
 There was something that really caught me about what Rinpoche was saying here,

00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:18.860
 like that when you're looking at that, the part on devotion,

00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:21.860
 it talks about how devotion to highly realized beings

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:26.860
 such as Buddha Shakyasvili group, Pama Sambava or Tara means that you feel close to them

00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:30.860
 and wish to attain the same ability that they have to help all sentient beings.

00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:35.860
 And I just remember reading over that and going, isn't that refuge in Bodhichitta right there?

00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:38.860
 Apparently the phone agrees.

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:44.860
 Yes, but there's something about that.

00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:48.860
 I never even thought of it that way in that sense, you know, cultivating that devotion.

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:52.860
 And how many teachings have we been to?

00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:58.860
 And everyone that I can remember, Rinpoche always starts with this refuge, Bodhichitta,

00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:03.860
 you know, standing firm on, you know, in confidence and in the view

00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:07.860
 and then from there, you know, with that view knowing that you're going to do this

00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:09.860
 for the sake of all sentient beings.

00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:14.860
 It just fascinated me, fascinated me too, you know, that how it just, you know,

00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:20.860
 it all just kind of sizzles in that devotion.

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:27.860
 And I think a big part of the sizzling is this, in a more like practical sense,

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:33.860
 when we stir fry something really hot, we do it quick, quickly,

00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:36.860
 keep it fresh, like kind of a little zap, you know,

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:39.860
 like in hearing these teachings, Gurur Rinpoche, they quote Gurur Rinpoche saying,

00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:41.860
 it's one of his final teachings in Tibet.

00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:44.860
 These like short sessions many times.

00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:49.860
 Like all this is so, it's so big if we try to take it on all at once

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:54.860
 and like have to be the big accomplished something of all this all at once.

00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:58.860
 But if we can connect to a simple thing, a good experience we've had,

00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:02.860
 some like deeper balanced side of ourselves,

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:05.860
 a good intention of wanting to help someone else

00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:09.860
 and just in a minute or two minutes, bring that motivation,

00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:11.860
 relax into it like you're saying.

00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:14.860
 It's so important to just let it be there and circulate

00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:20.860
 and then do like really to integrate just really short but very kind of genuine.

00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:27.860
 I think it's such a profound instruction that all these great masters have said that instruction,

00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:32.860
 but to really like kind of bring like that devotion and bring it up and let it be there

00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:36.860
 and then do the next thing we're doing in our lives.

00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:39.860
 I think so many masters have said it's good especially in the beginning

00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:44.860
 for the practice sessions for our mind to really like them.

00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:48.860
 Like we, because we have grasping mind, we're just starting so strong grasping,

00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:52.860
 we need to grasp on practice, especially in the beginning.

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:55.860
 Like it needs to be a pleasurable thing.

00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:57.860
 It needs to be something we want to do.

00:26:57.860 --> 00:27:02.860
 It needs to be seen as a way out, as like there's a path, you know.

00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:08.860
 Like so we keep it fresh, keep it short, like don't string it out and try to add on all this stuff

00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:12.860
 and then at the end we feel like we hope the session's done.

00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:14.860
 Gosh, this is so much, you know.

00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:20.400
 Because then we, that's another habit and then we say, oh, maybe I won't practice because it was so

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:20.860
 much.

00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:26.860
 Just, yeah, that's a crucial point when I started practicing that several people said it like,

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:31.860
 one, that no matter how complicated it can be and if you break it down, you know,

00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:38.860
 there's many aspects, but the conundrum is not really knowing the nature of lines

00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:41.860
 or all these things that you hear about at first.

00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:47.860
 So if maybe you don't have that much experience, but if you can connect with these feelings

00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:52.860
 that you have of love or relaxation and with that realize that,

00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:58.860
 like this one meditator told me one time, it's the most natural thing you could ever do.

00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:04.860
 Relax, sit still and look at your own mind.

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:12.040
 There's nothing more basic aside from breathing or, you know, as far as, it's just such a natural

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:12.860
 basic thing.

00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:19.380
 And then the other thing that really helped me, especially when I was just starting out, which I

00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:19.860
 still am,

00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:24.860
 but said, like you said, stop while you're ahead.

00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:29.860
 You know, quit while you're ahead, like don't, you know, when you, when you're,

00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:35.860
 once you sit down, you're engaged in the practice, you have mindfulness, it's still juicy,

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:41.860
 it's a short session, then dedicate to merit and then, and make that a session.

00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:46.860
 And like, I don't know, we used to joke like, how many times when somebody said,

00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:49.860
 oh, that meditation was so great, I just kept meditating and meditating,

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:51.860
 it was so wonderful and I just kept going and going.

00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:57.860
 And then you're like, watch out tomorrow, you know, like, especially during retreat,

00:28:57.860 --> 00:29:01.860
 because then it's like, oh, so many obstacles, you know, because it's too,

00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:05.860
 I've just seen that dozens, if not hundreds of times.

00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:13.840
 Oh, that was so good, so I just kept going instead of just like, slow, like steady, steady, steady,

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:13.860
 you know,

00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:18.860
 because all of a sudden you're like, well, I meditated so much last time that like,

00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:21.860
 maybe I don't need to meditate this time.

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:26.860
 Or anyway, it's just, I was just thinking of these basic points, how natural it is,

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:32.860
 how important and helpful it can be to not force yourself to sit for an hour and be miserable

00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:36.860
 and then the next time you're like, okay, I'm going to go sit and be miserable again,

00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:43.860
 but not necessarily the most helpful, you know, especially in the beginning like you were saying.

00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:47.860
 Of course, ultimately, meditation will help uproot all our habit patterns,

00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:50.860
 which means there's going to be a lot of bumps in the road, you know,

00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:55.860
 because our habit patterns are so entrenched that when you look to your mind and your habits,

00:29:55.860 --> 00:30:00.860
 you find habits that you don't necessarily like that aren't necessarily pleasant.

00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:03.860
 Otherwise, why would you sit in the practice in the first place

00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:09.860
 if everything was perfectly fine that you experienced in your life right now?

00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:19.860
 What's the impetus to work with that and change, you know?

00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:22.860
 And I think part of the devotion aspect as one of these points

00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:26.860
 is like refuge in three jewels, Buddha, Dharma, Sangha.

00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:28.860
 One of which is Sangha.

00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:32.860
 Like, not only do we need to try to end our own lives in a daily way

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:36.860
 to like have some kind of time set aside to cultivate a good pattern

00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:38.860
 of just checking in with ourselves, being mindful,

00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:40.860
 kind of trying to apply our techniques.

00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:45.860
 But it's really so special and important to check in with other people,

00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:51.860
 other Sangha members, getting together, kind of learning together,

00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:54.860
 studying the Dharma together, practicing together some,

00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:58.860
 like inspiring one another, helping one another, being there for each other.

00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:01.860
 I mean, I think so much is that, and like at the end of this chapter,

00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:07.860
 they say that defining characteristic of ignorance is we feel so separate.

00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:12.860
 Like that Sangha of like coming together, like developing these connections

00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:15.860
 that are so meaningful and just so profound,

00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:19.860
 based on really these such good pure intentions.

00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:22.860
 And then really, I mean, it's such a vital support.

00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:26.860
 And it's clearly like in this chapter, this devotion in three jewels,

00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:29.860
 like Sangha is definitely one of the three jewels.

00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:32.860
 I think it's so, so essential and so valuable.

00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:35.860
 And I think it's also one of those things that's most seen

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:38.860
 when you get to have the privilege of being around,

00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:40.860
 like Dharan brothers and sisters too.

00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:42.860
 Kind of like a big experience is like, wow,

00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:45.860
 I didn't know I was kind of missing this in a way.

00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:47.860
 But some people have a strong longing, really know they need it,

00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:49.860
 because they have to be around supportive people

00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:55.860
 that aren't constantly at odds with their vision of goodness and love

00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:57.860
 and trying to do good things.

00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:01.860
 Because you talk, I mean, I don't know if everyone has the same experience,

00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:04.860
 but I definitely remember it before I came here.

00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:07.860
 It was really hard because you'd sit down

00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:09.860
 and you'd have that moment of mindfulness.

00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:13.860
 You'd be reading something really beautiful, some kind of teaching.

00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:17.860
 And then you'd walk out your door and everyone's being rude.

00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:19.860
 I mean, like on what level? It's like, okay, great.

00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:24.860
 I get to practice this, but can I have some support in my practice here?

00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:28.860
 Rather than having to retreat back to my room and go back to the book,

00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:31.860
 like, oh wait, there's goodness. Okay, cool.

00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:38.860
 It's really, really beneficial to actually be with people,

00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:43.860
 actually put that emphasis on the practices,

00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:48.860
 having that support of having a practice buddy.

00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:51.860
 I mean, I was terrible at doing my nundro practices,

00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:55.860
 but then I got a nundro buddy, and it keeps me honest.

00:32:55.860 --> 00:33:01.860
 I end up at six in the morning.

00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:05.860
 And of course, too, like the part of, I mean, of course,

00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:10.860
 we're talking, we're kind of emphasizing our sangha brothers and sisters.

00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:15.860
 I mean, of course, just to actually be in the living presence

00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:19.860
 of great living master too and teacher,

00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:25.860
 and receive teachings and their blessings,

00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:29.860
 and just to witness their expression in this world.

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:35.860
 I mean, of course, that's inseparable. That's sangha too.

00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:38.860
 But just how much too, even for a sangha community,

00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:44.860
 who is kind of all students of great masters,

00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:54.860
 I mean, our teachers, there's, I mean, of course,

00:33:54.860 --> 00:34:02.860
 so many levels of like just the greatness

00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:07.860
 and such a beautiful opportunity and such major, major support.

00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:10.860
 I mean, of course, without our teachers, without the lineage,

00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:14.860
 without the Buddha coming into this world.

00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:20.860
 And then we're talking about meditation too.

00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:23.860
 I mean, I guess maybe we didn't, we probably,

00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:27.860
 we're in the section of the book where we're talking about meditation

00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:31.860
 and actually applying it as the path to,

00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:33.860
 but the focus of the whole book is, you know,

00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:37.860
 just becoming more and more familiar with the primordial nature

00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:43.860
 or revealing our primordial nature, knowing things exactly as it is,

00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:47.860
 is the path of meditation to, or like, you know,

00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:50.860
 the first sentence through revealing our own Buddha nature

00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:56.860
 and become enlightened on behalf of all beings.

00:34:56.860 --> 00:34:58.860
 And it just is so simple in a way,

00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:00.860
 just how each one of these things is so amazing,

00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:06.860
 how they all cross over and interlink and support each other.

00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:09.860
 I mean, but kind of, I guess the main thing people think about

00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:12.860
 with meditation sometimes is more, I mean,

00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:15.860
 with meditation is maybe the first connotation,

00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:19.860
 is that aspect of like concentration or something being quiet.

00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:23.860
 So I don't think it's interesting all these other aspects

00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:30.860
 that really create such good conditions, you know,

00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:32.860
 for realizing that nature.

00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:34.860
 I'm just speaking, you know, that's all.

00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:37.860
 Then I think all these are natural qualities of our mind.

00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:41.860
 Like these great bodhisattvas have so much joyful effort.

00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:45.860
 They have such clear, present, anchored awareness that's so fresh,

00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:48.860
 so devoted, they're just so humble,

00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:53.860
 they're just so much honor to these great wisdom beings in the lineage.

00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:57.860
 Then of course they can, there's samadhi and their abilities

00:35:57.860 --> 00:35:59.860
 that have come from that samadhi are so clearly demonstrated

00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:01.860
 again and again in their lives.

00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:04.860
 And obviously their wisdom being able to sensitively engage

00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:07.860
 with so many beings in such an all-inclusive way

00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:11.860
 that's so balanced, so impartial, and yet so sensitive and exacting.

00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:14.860
 I mean, they really, these are like natural wisdom abilities

00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:19.860
 that comes from like accomplishing meditation in this full sense,

00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:23.860
 like a full, fully embodying their nature, their humanness,

00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:30.860
 or their mind, like what the mind can do when it's fully engaged itself

00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:32.860
 and the surroundings.

00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:34.860
 So how about real quick, we'll see when the mind

00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:37.860
 isn't fully engaged with its surroundings.

00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:39.860
 There's, we're going to be chasing this chapter,

00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:42.860
 go through the opposites of each of these points really quickly,

00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:45.860
 just to be a little complete with this.

00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:48.860
 You see, the opposite of devotion is an absence of interest

00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:50.860
 and clear thinking about spiritual practice.

00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:53.860
 We see nothing more subtle than the ordinary objects around us,

00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:58.860
 so we can't progress in revealing our own hidden qualities either.

00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:01.860
 The opposite of joyful effort is laziness.

00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:02.860
 There's three types.

00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:05.860
 One, we're just lazy and we put off practice until later.

00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:09.860
 Secondly, we're overcome by our usual habits and we don't practice.

00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:13.860
 Thirdly, we're hard on ourselves and we ignore our goodness qualities

00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:15.860
 so we don't practice.

00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:19.860
 And so all laziness results in not practicing and thus not progressing

00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:21.860
 or not revealing more of our own goodness qualities

00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:23.860
 and seeing them in others.

00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:26.860
 Third, the opposite of mindfulness is forgetfulness.

00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:31.860
 We don't spend enough time clearly thinking about what is important

00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:34.860
 so we neglect what is deeply meaningful to us.

00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:37.860
 We need to firmly imprint in our mind what is truly important

00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:40.860
 and maintain this awareness over time.

00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:43.860
 Then the opposite of concentration is distraction.

00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:46.860
 We're distracted by external objects

00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:51.860
 and we're distracted by internal imaginations or projections, emotions, thoughts.

00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:54.860
 By strengthening and indulging in these distractions,

00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:56.860
 it really becomes a big problem.

00:37:56.860 --> 00:38:01.860
 And we must firmly work to keep our practice focused while we're meditating.

00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:04.860
 Then finally, the opposite of wisdom is ignorance.

00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:09.860
 And ignorance means not knowing emptiness, which is the true nature of things.

00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:13.860
 We have a strong inclination to feel separate, which creates my ego.

00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:18.860
 And what's not my ego is everyone else's egos.

00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:22.860
 And so all these relationships between my ego and others' egos

00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:24.860
 creates all kinds of hope and fear.

00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:27.860
 And then by uprooting this ignorance and this grasping,

00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:30.860
 we experience the great equanimity.

00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:33.860
 So that was the second half of this chapter.

00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:39.860
 Are there any final thoughts?

00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:41.860
 I have one question.

00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:45.860
 They say another form of lateness is being hard on yourself

00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:47.860
 and ignoring your good qualities.

00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:50.860
 To me, that doesn't seem like laziness.

00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:54.860
 It's something else more negative attitude.

00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:58.860
 And the other two parts, I can see how they were laziness.

00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:04.860
 I didn't see how that was.

00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:08.860
 I think the result is the same, which causes it to be laziness.

00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:10.860
 We don't think we're good.

00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:12.860
 We don't think we can develop much.

00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:14.860
 Or we're too busy.

00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:15.860
 I don't have time.

00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:18.860
 That's another way of being lazy.

00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:21.860
 Because in the end, it means we don't practice.

00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:27.860
 Like they say, there's an Eastern laziness and Western laziness.

00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:31.860
 Eastern laziness is let's have tea, or let's have more tea.

00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:34.860
 We kind of keep putting off the main point.

00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:38.860
 Western laziness is no time for tea, no time for tea, no time for tea.

00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:41.860
 So in the end, we put off our practice.

00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:47.860
 One is a kind of little dull, and the other is a little too busy.

00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:49.860
 And the other result is the same.

00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:51.860
 We don't do what's meaningful to ourselves.

00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:59.860
 We put it off.

00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:01.860
 I mean, on that same note too,

00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:05.860
 suspending our disbelief for just a little bit is so necessary.

00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:07.860
 If we're not at the end of the path,

00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:11.860
 we don't realize that we have all these qualities necessarily yet.

00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:15.860
 We don't have to provisionally have some degree of faith

00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:17.860
 and leave some space in our minds

00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:20.860
 to let our normal way of seeing ourselves as like,

00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:23.860
 you know, bad and all these things.

00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:26.860
 We have to like suspend that for just long enough to sit

00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:30.860
 and reinvigorate a different habit pattern

00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:35.860
 and reconnect with a new aspect of ourselves.

00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:37.860
 So I'll just put it...

00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:38.860
 Yeah.

00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:41.860
 And sometimes I think, you know, if you think too,

00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:44.860
 like if you kind of put yourself in another situation,

00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:46.860
 we surely should conclude soon.

00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:49.860
 But like in response to Kate's question,

00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:51.860
 like that part, think about like,

00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:53.860
 if somebody else was telling us,

00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:56.860
 "Oh, you can't do that. You're not good enough to do that."

00:40:56.860 --> 00:40:59.860
 I mean, maybe we'd feel a little more like...

00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:03.860
 But you really?

00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:06.860
 But it's like something, that same kind of energy,

00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:07.860
 but it's just closer.

00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:09.860
 I'll leave this kind of take it more,

00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:13.860
 just like whatever our other habits for not doing something might be.

00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:18.860
 It's just there seems like all these levels of laziness

00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:24.860
 are just different ways in which we avoid engaging with what we love.

00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:30.860
 You know, no matter, we're just all different kind of excuses we can use

00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:34.860
 that are good, that work for us.

00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:37.860
 You know, they either keep us from just starting altogether,

00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:40.860
 never even beginning to even try to start to practice,

00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:44.860
 or when we're there, just getting so distracted,

00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:47.860
 we never really progress very much.

00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:55.860
 Or you know, block it.

00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:58.860
 We have a lot to say about these things,

00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:02.860
 but we've kind of run out of time for tonight.

00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:06.860
 Bless.

00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:07.860
 Thank you.

00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:08.860
 Thank you.

00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:11.860
 Everyone enjoys, too, thinking about these

00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:16.860
 and discussing other groups happening.

00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:31.860
 We'll just dedicate the merit, just a moment of silence.

00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:42.860
 (Singing in foreign language)

00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:31.860
 (Singing in foreign language)

00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:34.860
 By this merit may all obtain omniscience.

00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:36.860
 May it defeat the enemy wrongdoing.

00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:39.860
 Run the stormy waves of earth, old days, sickness and death.

00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:42.860
 From the ocean of samsara may I free all beings.

00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:46.860
 The precious bodhicitta and those without it may it be generated.

00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:49.860
 And those who have it may it never diminish,

00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:52.860
 but always continue increasing.
