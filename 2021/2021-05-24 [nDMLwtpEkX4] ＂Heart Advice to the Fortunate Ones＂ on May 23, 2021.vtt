00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.160
 Thank you again very much everyone. Rakhidele is everyone. Rakhidele, thank you. Rakhidele is

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:11.840
 everyone.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:19.310
 Again, we're going to touch to the verse or teaching of the gracious, kindness, compassionate

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:20.000
 teacher,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:30.430
 Buddha Shakyamuni, which is clear and summarized with clarity and summarized by the very, very

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.240
 famous master in the 20th century.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:40.480
 And known as His Holiness, Dudnur Rinpoche, or Chabjie Dudnur Rinpoche, many of you know, we met,

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:47.950
 we had the fortune to meet these great masters. Even though you didn't meet, many of you all

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.040
 connected.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:55.200
 We're sharing the same teaching that we want to give. We're following that light.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:01.830
 So it's just really wonderful. It's authentic lineage teaching of loving kindness and compassion

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:02.800
 and wisdom.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:10.640
 And therefore, again, we activated our joy and appreciation and both each other and the purity

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:17.120
 understand or the realization of the Vajrayana teaching. Those are the motivations and those are

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:23.750
 the intentions. We have to prepare the intention perfectly, beautifully, as much as we can go

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:24.160
 through.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:32.000
 And then that way the Dharma in the teaching said that nectar of Dharma will absorb in the heart.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.840
 It's not interfered by the skeptical, ego-clinging, and suspicious, and intellectual, and all those

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.960
 unnecessary thoughts. We have so many which are really not going to benefit too much. Generally,

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.560
 it is always undermining wherever we have that. Whether it's Dharma or whether even in Samsara,

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.760
 if we have that so many times, maybe let it be okay. But if we carry that all the time,

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:06.960
 it undermines the growth of whatever the success of the Dharma and as well as Samsara.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:14.320
 So therefore, this time, particularly Dharma is more focused on the mind. Teaching is more focused

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:22.000
 on the mind. Mind and therefore preparation can prepare ourselves, ready to bring that

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.680
 collet which is kind of hidden behind of the midst of all those conceptions are

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:36.160
 unbeneficial. We bring the light up that. That is the powerful beginning practices.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.640
 What the greatest teacher, Buddha Shakyamali, said, "If the beginning is good,

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:48.400
 it will bring the middle is good." If we continue to carry that thought, then ending will be good.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:57.120
 So this all depends how we start that. It's really important. Then all total will become

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.320
 so beautiful. A hundred percent from top to bottom of the middle and every side.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:09.600
 And therefore, the intention is so important. And I'm reminding to all of us, to you and to me,

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:16.320
 that's the really we all need, every achieve. And with those beautiful intention thought,

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:23.200
 now we go to the teaching itself. And we are going through this poor wealth of the

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.000
 practitioners or the Dharma practitioners, by his only the neurons, which highlighted

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:36.160
 that whole. So we went first, among the four, we went first through. We went really first through.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:43.760
 And as I said, this full wealth that we have, we're never going to feel poverty or shortage.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.720
 Our spiritual realization or Dharma realization practices will be abundance.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:57.120
 It's not going to fade away or it's not going to expire. There's no, if we really keep this

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:05.920
 this fall, now always refreshing and not just only that we are activating and it brings the growth,

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:14.000
 development. It will bring the development. That means what development? Relation.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:22.720
 Relation, what? Loving kindness, compassion, joy and appreciation, all that what we said,

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:32.080
 the motivation, those all just really shine beautifully. And then it defeated all those

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.480
 ego clings, duality, or somebody, it will reducing that strength.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:45.550
 Strength, as much as we did that and then same time in the Buddha teaching is that the merit will

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.920
 gain.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:54.480
 Merit is taking places now. Not obscuration is taking places and our mind streams.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:02.800
 It's not. We're taking, we're turning the page. We're changing the directions. We're changing the

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:13.360
 course in our maybe first time in our lives because of the great teaching of the Buddha

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:21.280
 Shakyamuni, the great teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni. And therefore it's so, I mean this fall is so

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:27.920
 important. And now what in the teachings here, his own union we said here, we go through. The

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:36.800
 bodhicata of compassion towards all mother sentient beings. This we know, we all know.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:45.040
 What can we know? We know at least intellectually we know. We received this teaching so many times

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:51.680
 from our great masters. And our Sangha members also maybe released many times mentioning this

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:59.760
 Sangha members. Our friend, spiritual friend is talking that. So we know intellectually. But

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:07.680
 now it's knowing is not enough. We have to activate it again. And we said, you know, bodhicata

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:14.640
 is the essence of generally the Buddha teaching. Whether it is the Thera-Buddha school, whether it

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:22.640
 is the Mahayana, Sutra-Mahayana school, whether it is Vaidyana-Mahayana school, the Buddha teaching

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:32.160
 is best upon the compassion, loving kindness. Because of that, Buddha teaching is known as

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:39.600
 non-violence. Because of that, Buddha teaching is known as respecting and appreciating to every

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:50.240
 living beings. No one is excluded from the compassion. And Mahayana, it highlights very much.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:57.760
 That's called, that's what many great masters, many practitioners said that we heard, we all heard

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:58.000
 that.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:06.800
 Because of bodhicata is not Mahayana teaching is known as Mahayana. Mahayana is Sanskrit world.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:15.280
 And which is great week or great yana. Because who makes that? What is the cause of that?

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:24.160
 Principally cause of this bodhicata. Bodhicata can be divided into two you all know,

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:34.400
 related to bodhicata, absolute true bodhicata. These two bodhicata, max Mahayana, S-Mahayana,

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:45.440
 and Vaidyana, S-Mahayana. Without the bodhicata, there is just, it's talk. It's talk. It's a,

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:53.360
 can't relate what's called leap service. It's no, no meaning behind. When you have the bodhicata,

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:58.400
 according to teaching, according to all the great master that we had opportunity to meet,

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:06.320
 then Mahayana becomes the Mahayana, or S-Mahayana becomes S-Mahayana, and Vaidyana becomes the

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:11.920
 Vaidyana, Mahayana, or the Diamond Wake Up. Then it truly has become Diamond Wake Up.

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:21.360
 Diamond Wake Up. Otherwise, it is a name. Just name. That not going to serve the purpose. Maybe

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:28.960
 it's working for a short time to show up that, but in reality, there is no growth. Developing.

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:38.080
 It's only on the surface. So therefore, we have to activate this really bodhicata. For that reason,

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:44.800
 great Master Papaji probably said, many times you heard. I also mentioned, if you have one thing,

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:52.400
 one practice, that will be enough to reach enlightenment, or to become Buddha. If you

00:08:52.400 --> 00:09:00.160
 don't have one practices, no matter whatever we practices, it won't go lead any further.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:05.440
 What is that practices? That practice is bodhicata.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:16.000
 And for that reason, the unmysticity cause of the Buddhahood is bodhicata. For that reason,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:23.440
 I pay respect, or I pay homage. I pay homage. That's what great Master Papaji said.

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:33.920
 I mean, it's not just him. Everyone, one voice from India, all the great Master of all the schools

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:41.600
 of turbid Buddhism, and who become great bodhisattva enlightenment beings because of the practice

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:41.680
 on

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:49.200
 bodhicata. Really, it's so, so important, necessary. If we like to bring the peace and harmony

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:56.480
 to our own self, bodhicata is what we should do. If we like to bring peace and harmony in the

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:57.520
 family,

00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:03.200
 we should practice bodhicata. If we like to bring the peace and harmony in our neighborhood and

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:09.920
 village, we should practice the bodhicata. If we like to bring the larger peace to the world,

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:19.840
 start bodhicata. That tells something, really tells something so important and so spacious.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:30.160
 Then not bodhicata is in the teachings. It will bring that, that peace and harmony and joy

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:38.560
 to all the way to the enlightenment, and we become the Buddha. Our complete potential,

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:46.800
 or the Buddha nature, is fully waking up as it has potential, as it has opportunities.

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:55.200
 That really revolves, we become the Buddha. That is bodhicata. So therefore, that is Amadhyana. Of

00:10:55.200 --> 00:11:01.440
 course, you all know, as I said, we are reminded to each other. We are all practitioners. We are

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:08.240
 all the Sangha members. We are Sangha members, we are reminded to each other. Even though you heard

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:14.720
 this word, I heard this, but repeating is something so special in the teachings, that's what we do,

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:22.400
 giant. Even we giant mantras, because it's so important. It makes some imprint, imprint our

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:29.280
 channels, our mind streams, saying good things. We're not saying gossips. We're not saying

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:29.920
 something,

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:37.680
 some skeptical or that will hurt and damage to anyone. We're talking about repeating the follow

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:43.200
 teaching of the Buddha, Buddha, and uplifting and ushering, and kind of in a way,

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:50.640
 to talking about our own beautiful qualities. That's what really we have. Bodhicata is our nature,

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:58.000
 our qualities. So therefore, it's very powerful, beneficial, and benefited to many levels.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:04.400
 And now, with that understanding, I talk about bodhicata. Bodhicata, when you develop in the

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:12.160
 teaching, Mahayana teaching, then you all know two bodhicata, reaching bodhicata and actualizing

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:17.760
 bodhicata, these two bodhicata. I'm not going to talk too much. Of course, you all know those. I

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:23.680
 want to talk about that. But among those two bodhicata, what is mostly important for the

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:32.080
 beginner, such as us, which is most important? Wishing bodhicata. What is wishing bodhicata?

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:40.960
 Every simply. If I say simply, it is good heart. Good heart that equal to all the sentient beings,

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:50.400
 or all the living beings. Good heart. Big good heart. Good heart. And then if we go let it

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:57.840
 detail or make that more clarity, it's compassion. It's compassion. Compassion to all beings.

00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:05.440
 If we go let them all that, then our next step is we all know. Loving kindness. Loving kindness is

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:14.320
 compassion. That is essence of the bodhicata. So that is very familiar for us. We all know,

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:20.240
 hurt. Even before we practiced dharma, we hurt love and compassion.

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:28.720
 Loving kindness, compassion, and good heart. But when we practice dharma, what are we doing?

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:38.400
 We're activating, not leaving that in the sleeping domes. We're activating. Bring

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:45.440
 glory. Let it shine. We abolish him. We glorify that, that our richness call us.

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:53.360
 When we have the good heart and love and compassion, all those, immediately we feel

00:13:53.360 --> 00:14:03.200
 ourself. More calmer, more peaceful, more happy, more joy. And things are kind of quite good,

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:11.760
 everything kind of begins. Really we begin to see appreciating, grateful. This all comes because

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:20.030
 symbol our nature. We're tragic to our own nature, our own qualities. That is what it is. This is

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:20.080
 the

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:26.880
 Buddha teaching. Not just because the Buddha said then we believe him. This is not believing. This

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:33.760
 is evidence. We can witness ourself. And we have love and compassion and good heart.

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:42.480
 What benefit is this? Immediately we feel. But behind the scene, according to teaching,

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:49.200
 teaching of the gracious teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni, and some of all the linear masters,

00:14:49.200 --> 00:15:01.440
 it will heal our scars, emotional scars, scars. It will heal those psychological scars.

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:10.160
 It's more powerful medicine than any other drugs. It's really something taking such

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:18.720
 from the deep, deep. And it will heal the disease, sicknesses. For that reason, in the lineage

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:29.600
 teaching we mentioned, one medicine that will take care of everything. One medicine that will

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:39.440
 take care of everything. That's what Buddha named. One medicine that will take care of everything.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:46.560
 It's true. Then deep down, deep down that invisible, maybe don't see immediately,

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:57.040
 but we purify the obscurations. When you have the bodhicata, generally our anger, our jealousness,

00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:03.200
 our attachment of those are really kind of like almost hiding behind.

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:11.840
 We don't, in bodhicata we have that. We don't have too much powerful, igniting anger,

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:19.440
 or jealousness, arrogance, all that. It's all kind of like sneaking out in the behind.

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:27.920
 That happened. It's true. We're not just talking that somebody that's happening,

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:34.640
 and we're going to get that. No. We have the bodhicata. Love and compassion

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:41.120
 is happening right that moment. You all know, or we all know. So that is how powerful it is,

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:49.440
 really, bodhicata. And therefore, wishing bodhicata is so important, that love and compassion,

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:58.000
 and that kindness, or good heart, simple. It's just so special. And that moment, that moment,

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:06.080
 even the samsara world, they will say, oh, that person is a good guy, or good lady. That good lady

00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:14.320
 and a good guy is not reading as a label on our forehead, or someone. It tells the heart,

00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:22.080
 heart of those individuals, has something letter, siddling quality than the average people.

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:30.960
 So that is bodhicata. That is good heart. Love and kindness, compassion. Now, with this

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:36.480
 understanding, in a gracious teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni, in lineage teaching, as you all know,

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:45.600
 known as when you activated that, then poor, boneless practices. Poor, boneless practices.

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:53.440
 Or poor, boneless, what are those? Generally, again, is it something that we all know? We all

00:17:53.440 --> 00:18:03.680
 heard. And our nature, your nature and my nature, we now bring on the spotlight, not leaving that

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:09.840
 behind of all the emotions, the obscurations, all the darkness, we bring that on the light.

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:17.600
 What are those? And you all know, poor, boneless. But to be key, before to become poor, boneless,

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:28.080
 what is known as, I mean, we all know, is love and kindness, compassion, joy, and equanimities.

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:36.640
 Those are known as poor, boneless. Every living being has that. This is not only the

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:43.680
 Mahayana practitioners. We all, every living being, before we met Dharma, or is it the teaching,

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:53.040
 teach, we have that. It's something our own inherent in nature. Those are what in a gracious

00:18:53.040 --> 00:19:00.320
 teaching, Buddha Shakyamuni in teaching, say those are the light of Buddha nature.

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:10.000
 Love is light of the Buddha nature. Compassion is light of the Buddha nature. And joy is light of

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:18.080
 the Buddha nature. And equanimity is light of the Buddha nature. It's dawn, it's light,

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:24.880
 it's beams of light is coming. And some people, or some individually, has a little more,

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:29.920
 because it's coming more. Some are a little less, because it's hiding behind the

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:35.600
 midst of the different, all the different qualities, or different those habit patterns,

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:43.040
 or the unkind of healthy habit patterns. But reality, no one is absent of these qualities.

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:51.040
 That's what we are teaching, and we know no one is absent. That means include animals,

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:58.000
 include all the invisible beings. According to Buddhism, there is invisible beings,

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:04.960
 not just only the visible beings. According to Buddhism, we are not just only the human beings.

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:11.280
 There are many others, those are known as you all know. We all heard them, we all heard six beings.

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:20.880
 According to Buddhism, they are truly existing. They are living beings. They are equally

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:30.640
 same as others. What that means? Everyone wants happy. Everyone wants peace. Everyone,

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:40.480
 all the beings have six limbs. No one wants suffering. No one wants troubles, misfortunes.

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:52.320
 Sadness is same intention. There's no one is. As human beings, we don't want sadness,

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:59.840
 we don't want sadness or suffering, troubles, and that we like to be happy, joy, peace.

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:06.480
 That's what really we want. I mean, we're all the same. There's no difference. But yet,

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:12.320
 reality, how are we going, even what that's our deep desire, but how are we going through?

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:20.480
 It's not always fulfilling, not happening always. We struggle, struggling.

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:28.240
 "Therefore," her great master, his only said, "all the living beings have the compassion

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:34.240
 in both each other. All the mother-sentence beings have the happiness or compassion."

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:45.360
 Mother-sentence beings, all they have this. So that means, now when we have this love, compassion,

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:51.520
 joy, appetitions that I said to everyone else, but now we have to a little bit

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:58.800
 accelerating that love and compassion. We have to accelerate that joy. We have to

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:05.680
 accelerate that economy. Accelerating. So that means we have to lift up the level,

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:12.320
 not just lift that on ground or where they are. We have to accelerate. We have to bring up.

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:23.040
 When we bring up that, how we started that? Then, always in Mahayana teaching said, expand that.

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:31.040
 But at the end of time, all of us has this, that for qualities. Those all good.

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:39.920
 Love is good. Convention is good. Joy is good. Economic is good. No one will deny that. No one

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:47.920
 will dispute that. Everyone will. But this person, the regular one, our love and compassion, joy

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:59.280
 is limited. It's partialities. It's just selected. It's just judgmental. That's what is our love.

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:05.520
 And that is love and compassion. But even though that is like that, which is good,

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:12.160
 definite. But when Mahayana teaching, we say that. Then bring that to the boundless.

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:21.280
 Boundless. All that is sometimes translated limitless. What to bring? Limitless.

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:28.160
 Bring loving kindness to the limitless. Bring compassion to the limitless.

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:39.740
 Bring joy to the limitless. Bring economic to the limitless. Bring all of those you should bring up

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:39.840
.

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:51.840
 Bring up and extend what that means. Our love is not kind of selected and targeted love. Our target

00:23:51.840 --> 00:24:04.240
 is here, all the beings of six realms. All the beings of six realms is our love is spreading.

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:12.880
 And we are really sending the love to all the sentient beings. Then compassion is same. Joy is

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:20.480
 same. Equanimity is same. That is boundless. That love and compassion and joy and that

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:28.760
 equanimity is what is in the teaching said. That is completely based upon the wisdom and non-jud

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:29.280
gmental.

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:37.200
 Non-judgmental. And then maybe if you have some realization of the nature is also emptiness.

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:44.800
 Loving kindness is emptiness. Compassion is the emptiness. Joy is the emptiness.

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:51.840
 Equanimity is emptiness. What that means? Maybe. I'm sure you all know. Many of you know already.

00:24:51.840 --> 00:25:00.800
 But so few of you don't know. What that means? It means love even though it's so precious,

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:09.670
 so special loving kindness. But where is that love? If somebody asks or if you ask yourself or if

00:25:09.670 --> 00:25:09.920
 we

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:18.160
 ask to ourselves where is that my beautiful love loving kindness? Can we show? Can we tell? Can you

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:26.640
 bring that? There's nothing really we can bring. We can show. But yet it doesn't mean that when

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:32.720
 we don't can't show and we can't bring. It didn't mean that it does not exist. It's here. That's

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:41.360
 what we talk. That's what everybody said. I love you. I like you very much. All those expressions.

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:52.720
 So reality is empty. That's the way we can expand. Because it's empty. We can expand to all the

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:53.120
 living

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:59.760
 beings. This in the teaching, both the other teachings such as like absolute body to the

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:07.280
 teaching. All the living beings are also like like illusive beings or magic beings. There's no

00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:08.240
 solid

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:14.560
 living beings. That means the Lord solid existing unchangeable living beings.

00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:26.080
 Everyone is best on that magical status. So same way our love is magical status.

00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:36.240
 We're extending that to all the living beings. Openly, freely, truly that is known as

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:44.240
 boundless love. According to the teaching of the Greek teacher, Buddha Hekamuni. Why is it called

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:52.240
 boundless? Because it's boundless. Because the power is boundless. Object is boundless.

00:26:53.920 --> 00:27:04.300
 And subject is boundless. And benefit is boundless or limitless. What means that object is bound

00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:04.560
less?

00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:11.920
 To whom we object that loving kindness is all the living beings. There is no

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:19.840
 numbers of the living beings according to Buddha teaching. So many beings you cannot count.

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:28.320
 It's countless. So therefore, this love, our love is going to all those beings.

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:38.080
 If I can't count, then six beings. Beings of six realms. It's really going to everyone.

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:44.160
 And where is it coming? Form your true heart and mind.

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:53.440
 And we can find the subject is boundless. And we look trying to look at the boundary of our mind.

00:27:53.440 --> 00:28:01.920
 No, I don't think we can find. Nobody can find boundary of our love, our mind.

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:07.680
 Even though it's our own mind, you ask, we ask ourselves,

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:20.640
 do we see the edge and the boundaries and what? No. Same. It's boundless or limitless.

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:31.200
 So therefore, love is coming from there to all. Then power is boundless.

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:38.000
 It's according to even though we don't see all the beings. But when we have that really

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:44.970
 truly that thought is reaching to all the sentient beings, everyone, like ripple, the Northern

00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:45.280
 light,

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:53.520
 ripple and beams of light is going to every directions without any boundaries.

00:28:53.520 --> 00:29:02.000
 That's how the power is, is benefiting some degree according our capability and their

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:12.000
 readiness situations. And then benefit. So powerful. When we develop road each other,

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:20.400
 even one moment, one moment or one incident in the Buddha teaching said it has power to remove

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:30.640
 all the sufferings, the cause of sufferings. And what the great master Shanti Deva says,

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:39.600
 moment you develop the bodhisattva, that moment you are named as bodhisattvas. That moment.

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:48.880
 And the moment we develop the bodhisattva in our heart and mind, that moment we will burn down

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:57.120
 the obscuration that which has accumulated so many eons. It will burn down. That's all the

00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:06.790
 Shanti Deva said. Moment we develop the bodhisattva in our heart, it's like a comments that transm

00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:07.200
ute

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:17.920
 iron to the gold. Quote, moment that regular kind of unload and not so expensive iron,

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:29.280
 and we have no arguments, we transform that to the nugget of gold. Our mind become the mind of

00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:39.920
 enlightenment, not mind of samsara, not mind of dualities. So those all benefit of this bodhisattva

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:39.920
.

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:50.160
 Bodhi. And then that's the beginning. It goes on and on. And all the path and all the movements

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:58.480
 realization that all been added up with this bodhisattva, as we develop the bodhisattva,

00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:05.680
 that much released. So therefore, this bodhisattva is so important and that is loving kindness. And

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:12.400
 then the first one kind of having those loving kindness in the heart and mind, and then what?

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:20.080
 Compassion. Compassion, boneless compassion, boneless joy, and boneless

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:26.080
 equanimity. You all know these things. I mean, we all received this teaching so many times.

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:32.160
 As I said earlier, I'm reminding to all of us, each other, really that. So we can activate it

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:39.520
 even short time for two minutes, three minutes, five minutes. It really has power. It has power,

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:46.400
 visibly power, invisibly. It has such big power to purify the obscuration, to accumulate the

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:56.830
 merits of that. That is so. And this is also known as this poor boneless is how we develop the

00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:57.200
 wishing

00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:05.120
 bodhisattva. It's in our mind, in our heart. But now, when you activate that, because of that,

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:11.200
 with this loving kindness, this poor boneless, then we take bodhisattva vows.

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:20.720
 We take bodhisattva and ceremonies. And when we have the bodhisattva and then we,

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:27.680
 or even you really have the vows of bodhisattva, when you see this value and importance, activating

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:35.520
 that bodhisattva, loving the compassion and joy and the equanimity, then with that intention,

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:44.000
 then with that thought, activating those intention into the action, physical action, verbal actions

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:44.000
,

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:51.760
 and as well as mental actions, those all known as actualizing bodhisattva. You're actualizing

00:32:51.760 --> 00:33:00.160
 the bodhisattva. And then according to you, or as you develop bodhisattva and what is, then you

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:06.960
 develop all your moving and accumulating all those six paramatas. Six paramatas, it looks like

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:13.120
 transcendental, transcendental practice of those practices. It looks very fancy. I can't vote

00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:21.390
 transcendental, six paramatas, all that. But all best on this simple good heart, love and

00:33:21.390 --> 00:33:22.480
 compassion,

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:30.720
 joy and an equanimity, that's really best on all that. That's it. I think it's all. And the six

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:37.680
 transcendental or six paramatas, of course you all know, at least the names missed. And

00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:44.720
 fourth, the generosity transcendental or transcendental practice of the generosity. Second,

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:52.800
 the transcendental practice of the moralities. Third is transcendental practice of the patience

00:33:52.800 --> 00:34:00.800
 or the tolerance. And fourth is transcendental practice of the joyful effort to the virtues,

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:10.720
 virtues. And fifth is transcendental practice of the concentrations or meditations. And then

00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:18.000
 sixth is transcendental practice of the wisdom. What does that mean? Wisdom. Wisdom that see

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:18.640
 clearly

00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:27.040
 where things are as it is. And wisdom that see also nature of the everything where things are.

00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:38.800
 Nature. See the way things are appears, but see also where things are, reality-less.

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:49.440
 Seeing that, that is wisdom, exactly where things are. So those are. That was all practice best

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:58.000
 on these four boneless practices. Practices. This four boneless practices is the vehicle

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:06.240
 and four boneless practice is the is the protein and four boneless practice is fiber.

00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:13.360
 And four boneless practice is vitamins, multiple vitamins to reach Buddhahood.

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:21.840
 Buddhahood also looks so fancy and so difficult. Reality level, according to teaching,

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:32.560
 we discovered our basic nature as it is now. Without any obscuration, without any cover-up.

00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:41.680
 We clearly discovered that. That's it. That's nothing else. We return, what many times in

00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:50.720
 teaching said, we return back to our ordinal dominion. We back to our ordinal status.

00:35:50.720 --> 00:36:00.800
 We know the interference of the one's own deed of dualities. We reach that. That is Buddhahood.

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:08.800
 That is enlightenment. That is, that moment our bodhicata, mind we like to become

00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:16.480
 the wisdom of the enlightenment. Then we become. That's it. Wisdom of the enlightenment.

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:21.520
 That is what it is. So, in order to do that, we're here.

00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:32.880
 The great master, his own, you said, the bodhicata of comparing to all the sentient beings,

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:42.320
 all the beings, as much as we can, have the bodhicata and activating that. And of course,

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:51.440
 due to our habit patterns of the many lifetimes, many times our bodhicata, our compassion,

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:58.080
 loving kindness, won't stay all the time. This is not something that we don't have the love and

00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:06.160
 compassion because the habit pattern of our habit pattern of the duality is so strong,

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:14.880
 so saturated, really so saturated. It's so easy to come that this habit patterns of duality,

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:22.400
 so easy. We don't have to make any effort to have the habit pattern of duality that we know.

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:30.400
 I mean, you know, me know. No. It just easily comes. But when we explore our own true nature,

00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:36.240
 because it's hidden behind this habit pattern of duality, we have to make effort.

00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:44.080
 Even though it's our own nature, we have to make effort. We have to have courage.

00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:50.240
 We have to go on and on. By that time, what are we doing? We're changing the course.

00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:57.680
 We're not running an obedient of our old habit pattern of the duality.

00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:07.200
 Really, we see that what is making this habit pattern of our duality is making to us,

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:14.560
 to myself, to the others, up to our loved ones and all the beings. It is troublemakers.

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:27.120
 It is disturbances. It is obstacles, making. But yet, because we sold, according to a graduate

00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:35.040
 teacher, Buddha Kya Kya Muni, we've been so many lifetimes in this samsara, so many lifetimes.

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:41.360
 Even there's no numbers. That's what I mean, you know, you heard those teachings. We are here too.

00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:49.600
 I'm repeating that what I heard. No numbers. That time, we completely saturated, decated

00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:58.080
 by the force of our own habit pattern of dualities. So we become, completely contrary in a way,

00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:04.320
 habit pattern of duality becomes so natural for us. And our own true nature, loving kindness,

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:12.720
 compassion, and joy and appreciation almost become aliens. Aliens. And we have to, to bring,

00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:19.520
 to touch those qualities, we have to make efforts. That's what great master, Buddha Kya Kya Muni,

00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:26.160
 lay out those six paramata practices, how to defeat that habit patterns of the dualities,

00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:34.400
 and bring forth back to our dominion or our places. We continue to do that. But what great

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:42.160
 master Chanti Deva said, "If we work for heart with joy and a courage and commitment, there's

00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:51.040
 nothing is not, nothing is difficult. Everything will become easy." As we are completely

00:39:51.040 --> 00:40:00.000
 familiar and is carried by the force of duality. And that we can tell. Duality is so easy to come

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:07.440
 for us. As I said earlier, we don't have to make any effort. We don't have to make any emotions,

00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:14.560
 to come emotions, any effort. It just comes. We can say it's almost spontaneous.

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:22.400
 But, on the other hand, our own true love, compassion, or natural love and compassion,

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:31.920
 wisdom, we have to make effort to reveal. We make that effort to reveal. That is known as

00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:41.120
 following the path. Path to discovering our own true nature. And therefore,

00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:50.480
 again, as I said, you all know. You all know so many times. The best thing, the best of

00:40:50.480 --> 00:41:00.240
 to discover our own nature is just start what we have now. What that means? We have love,

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:08.560
 compassion, and joy, and the economy we have right now. Some believe we have that. It's not

00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:08.880
 something

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:14.800
 that we have to learn the new things, and something strange things we have to break.

00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:23.600
 What we have, that is what we should learn, and develop, and increase, really. If we do that,

00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:31.120
 that is called practicing. Practicing dharma, and that practice is spiritual.

00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:36.400
 Buddha teaching is not something that strange we think we have to do, or alien something, or new

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:45.600
 idea, new things we have to learn. Touch best. Buddha teaching is touch best. Our own nature.

00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:55.120
 That is beginning. That is starting momentum. That is a way to the confidence and the fulfillment.

00:41:55.120 --> 00:42:04.720
 Really, one's own nature. And that is our goal to fulfill all that. And that is for that reason.

00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:11.280
 And if we keep this bodhic citta with love and compassion, that is one of the best wealth

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:22.880
 of the dharma, practitioners. Really, we always become the reach of heart, love, and compassion.

00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:30.560
 Joy. All that comes, even though on the visible level, immediately, and then,

00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:38.000
 benefit is so tremendous, and so powerful. It is working. Those are what the teaching said,

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:43.440
 and that is what'sness by so many great masters and great practitioners, and citta who reach

00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:50.080
 enlightenment. They practice this. They follow with this. They see this value, and important,

00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:57.760
 and benefits. Really. So therefore, I mean, this, for that reason, it is one of the great wealth

00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:02.800
 of the practitioners. It's like life support of the practitioners,

00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:08.560
 to reach enlightenment. And that is my talk for today. And thank you very much, everyone,

00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:13.760
 again, for participating. Thank you. Thank you very much, everyone. Thank you. Thank you.

00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:16.000
 Then we do, again, short dedication.

00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:28.400
 Short dedication, that which is, again, we have this page, page 32, we do that. And after that,

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:38.400
 then, as I said, we do the healing practices. By this merit, may all, may it defeat the enemy

00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:43.680
 wrong drawing. From the stormy waves of the birth, the organ, the sickness, and the death.

00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:46.960
 From the ocean of the samsara, may I free all beings.

00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:57.360
 Okay. Now we do the, the holy mental practices. If you have these texts, we start right to the

00:43:57.360 --> 00:44:05.050
 practices. And page one, we already did a seven line prayer, the prayers. So we started right there

00:44:05.050 --> 00:44:05.440
.

00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:10.320
 And again, this healing practice with, thank you to all living beings who are really sick now,

00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:14.880
 who are having so much difficulties. And the body in the Buddha teachings is sick of the,

00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:22.000
 all the different things. As we did prayer here, what did I get in praise? Old age and what it said

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:28.320
 here. And what in the teaching, I'm sorry, here. What in the teaching said here, that the, and this

00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:36.240
 defeat the enemy wrong drawing. From the stormy waves of the birth, the organ, the sickness, the

00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:42.320
 death. Those are the really, everyone is experienced. And the foundation cause of those in

00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:49.280
 the Buddha teachings is a negative emotions. Negative emotions, negative emotions are our

00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:57.520
 habit patterns that well causing. So we really do this healing practice, thinking of all living

00:44:57.520 --> 00:45:02.560
 beings. They free from the sickness of the body where they're going through troubles with that.

00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:08.960
 And the plastic cause of those in a deep, completely free the hill. So I extended the

00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:16.400
 body together as we talk and then we do this practice again. Thank you.
