00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.770
 Nature is self-luminous clarity status. It is empty. It is clarity. It is essence of the nature,

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:13.900
 nature, nature.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:30.470
 And from that, oh yeah, so this is also known as, he used many different terminology, I already

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.170
 said those, and the Dhaka Garbha, and the Dharmakaya, Pandya Paramata, and the Salt Bone Buddhas,

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:41.250
 all those different names, names that is all that same thing, is, from this, now, how this is

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.200
 started the delusions.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:53.540
 This is, Janel again, said here, this nature is pervasive nature. Nature has no partialities. It's

00:00:53.540 --> 00:01:04.010
 open. But senses arise energy. Energy arises when sentient beings, when this energy arises from

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.200
 that nature.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:17.600
 Then we sentient beings, beings not immediately recognize that is self-arising energy, and we play

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:27.200
 subtle thoughts of the subject and objects, kind of separations, subject and object.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:37.490
 That is, when you play that thoughts, that is then beginning of the ignorance. That subtle thought

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:46.590
 of subject and object, and when that subtle grasp of small division thoughts, even though it is

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:55.980
 your own display, our own display, but yet didn't kind of immediately realize that and play as

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:56.200
 subject and object.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:05.200
 That's the subject and object notion, and from that, then begin to extend the ignorance.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:14.130
 That beginning ignorance is, great master pointed out, as ignorance, salt bone ignorance, is that

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:20.200
 moment. So that means, original ignorance, that tells us.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:27.890
 With that, kind of a little bit stronger, and then, again, that didn't stop the display. Arising

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:35.300
 energy didn't stop there, began to, simultaneously expanding more, and then grasping the subject,

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.200
 object and object, started expanding.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:46.980
 Not just expanding, also same time. Then we had more, a little bit stronger, strength of the

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.200
 grasping, one after another.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:57.980
 From that, and then all the emotions arises, and a little bit, that is, so, and that is, then, as

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:09.620
 the emotions, and then, all the, not such as emotions, the seed of the attachment, and as well as

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:18.200
 anger, and then yellows, and then, aerobics, and big that, and toghed with that.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:26.980
 And then hope and fears. All that begins arises. This is, with that happening, that is known as,

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:34.560
 then, immediately, that habit pattern, that print is, whatever that happening is printed, or that

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:41.100
 habit chart, is already started printing, that is known as, then, the alaya that registered every

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.200
 habit pattern.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:49.970
 That habit pattern is not the different alaya or the ground there, but within that status, within

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:57.860
 that ordinary natural status, then all these habit patterns are one after another, kind of like,

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.200
 imprinted.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:07.980
 That is known as how the sentient beings are deluded. And for that reason, again, here, a great

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:16.380
 master taught a quotation from the tantra, tantra, or known as unimpeded tantra, zoki tantra, and

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.200
 from there, it is similar, similar statement, same thing as, like, spray upon the zapu.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:31.910
 When the, when the, the ordinary natural is not, from the ordinary natural, from the ordinary

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:41.040
 natural, from the ground, ground, when the energy arises at that moment, with not recognize that

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:46.200
 energy is the same as one's own display, and there is, then, subtle.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:54.250
 Here, he has used the noun, numbness, or numbness, or the still, subtle panic started, subtle panic

00:04:54.250 --> 00:05:03.200
, numbness thought as separating the object, that worry is the beginning of the delusion.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:13.200
 That worry is the beginning of delusion, and that was said in the, in the zoki tantra, zoki tantra.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:20.260
 So then, from that ignorance, that subtle ignorance, and then all the different ignorance are

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:27.200
 arising. Those are known as seven different, kind of like, subdivisions of ignorance.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:35.090
 Then, that all started, and those are, then here, used as, like, grasping, attachment, dullness,

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.200
 numbness, and so forth.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:43.610
 I'm not trying to count these things, but however, then it's a little bit also sloppy, twerkingness

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:51.180
, and all that arises, and all together is sub-division of the seventh ignorance, kind of, begin,

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.200
 sub-pantanous, all that.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:06:02.990
 And, from that, from this, then, from this ignorance, and then, when it becomes gross, stronger,

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:10.200
 then becomes notion of the ego-clinging, my, me, and my self, all that.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:18.200
 When that happen, it happen, then there is also notion of the others, others. We have our self as

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:27.200
 clingy to ego-clinging, then others, and that is again a great master, known as the dharma-kriti,

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.200
 in his teaching, what he said.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:38.200
 He said, moment you grasping to your self, that moment you also projected others, others.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:44.290
 And moment we grasping to our self, we attach to our self, and we start to, kind of, distance

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:45.200
 others.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:52.420
 From that, then attachment, and all these emotions arise one after another. So, that's exactly the

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:53.200
 same thing.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:07:00.020
 As we hold to, same thing, he said to, same thing. As we hold to our self, then we, kind of, start

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:02.200
 holding others, are different.

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:09.020
 And then, through this, then, all the different emotions arise one after another, and that

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:12.200
 ignorance is known as exaggeration ignorance.

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:20.980
 So here, ignorance, why? Very beginning is this inborn ignorance, all ordinary ignorance, and after

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:28.200
 that, more, kind of, level, and that is exaggeration or labeled ignorance.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:36.020
 This ignorance is also, when some kind of ignorance, emotion consciousness. Consciousness, and it

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:44.200
 is also part of the mind consciousness, according to the earth consciousness.

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:52.370
 Because it is projected as such a subject and object, then, this then is also beginning to have so

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:55.200
 many different attachments.

00:07:55.200 --> 00:08:03.980
 What? So many variety of attachments with ignorance. Ignorance is the continuation, kind of, up-

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:06.200
keeping, maintaining that.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:13.340
 With many, many attachments, such as then, there is all subdivisions, 40 subdivision attachments,

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:15.200
 counted in the teaching.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:23.430
 But again, what are those, such as few of those, as the attachment, grasping, clinging, important,

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:27.200
 and craving, those all kind of properties.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:33.200
 But anyway, all that is known as then, the attachment, all that arises.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:43.990
 From this attachment, then expanding, more habit patterns, that continue flowing, one after another

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:51.530
, another, and then, more stronger coming, and then, then is known as then, start getting anger is

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:52.200
 coming.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:09:02.460
 But that anger is carried by the powerful, also, force of the wind, wind energy. Wind energy that

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:07.200
 comes with attachment in ignorance, strong, pervasive.

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:15.460
 And that is then, because of that, that all different kind of habit patterns are grossly began to

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:21.200
 come, such as the body, country, and our mind.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:27.200
 And that, through that, then, six of the five consciousness are begin to develop.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:36.200
 And the five consciousness are, then, such as eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and the sixth is mind.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:44.280
 And that, through that kind of, that, post-carried us, our mind, stabilization, is carried out that

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:45.200
 force.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:51.200
 And that, together with the combined, with the, then, the winds, wind energy.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:56.200
 Those are the five root winds, and the five branch winds.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:01.350
 And maybe, I also won't count those five. Five wind, I think many of you heard those before, so

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:02.200
 many times.

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:11.000
 So, I won't count. So, five wind, root, comes, root, wind, and the five wind that related with the

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.200
 five organs.

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:18.950
 Maybe, I said other day too. But those are the root, the branch winds are related with the five

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:19.200
 organs.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:28.940
 The wind of the eye consciousness, wind of the ear consciousness, wind of the nose, and then tongue

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:33.200
 and body, those are the branch winds.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:46.820
 And then, five are the root, big five, five. And so, that, this ten becomes the light as force, or

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:51.200
 the weakness of the consciousness, and carried everywhere.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:57.200
 And then, also, through that, expanding all the delusions.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:07.200
 All the delusions and projecting back, and resenting that, and then goes on and on, on.

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:14.200
 And this is all known as then, also known as emotion consciousness.

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:21.200
 All together can be named as emotion consciousness, consciousness.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:27.200
 This, from this, again, all together, what grows lower.

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:33.200
 And we are fulfilling this, all the kind of desire things, it's called attachment.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:38.960
 If not, fulfilling everything, and there is a certain kind of like, also, then, hate and the

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.200
 worries comes.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:45.200
 And those are known as then. That is the angles.

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:50.490
 And all angles are kind of, again, subdivisions are thirty-three angles, those are the sub-div

00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:51.200
isions.

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:59.470
 And what are those? They are really, again, worry, sad, and as well anxieties, and then, as well as

00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:02.200
 agitations, uncomfortable troubles.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:06.200
 And then, anger itself, tormenting.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:13.020
 In all the trogid, there is thirty-three related with, kind of, a little bit, like, highlighted as

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:14.200
 anger, all of this.

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:19.490
 But, of course, it has a document, it has ignorance, all of that is not just from anger, anger

00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:20.200
 itself.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:23.200
 All that is combined trogid.

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:29.200
 Every three of those, therefore, known as three poisons, is all combined trogid.

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:35.200
 And then, start to working, and all is known as in working.

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:43.200
 All these, like, seven ignorance, forty attachment, thirty-three, thirty-three,

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:50.200
 I think it all comes, mostly about, like, eighty different emotions.

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:56.200
 Yeah, I think eighty different emotions, eighty different emotions.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:13:05.000
 But, again, it's just different sub-divisions of the way it exists, reflecting, but all is in three

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.200
 poisons.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:13.200
 Three poisons are the root of the emotions, from that, then, all this expendence.

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:20.200
 This goes on and on. That is how the samsara is maintained.

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:24.200
 And that's how the samsara is continued.

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:30.200
 This becomes our passage, the root being's passage.

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:39.630
 And that, all the result, result, whatever it comes, result, that is played in the screens of their

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:40.200
 ground.

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:45.200
 Same ground of the nirvana, same ground of the enlightenment.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:53.200
 And more, as it's played there, and again, it starts with maintaining, reactivating more and more,

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:59.600
 spontaneous, without any effort, without any partnerships, in a way, all that emotions arise in

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:00.200
 this.

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:06.200
 This is how the samsara beings are diluted.

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:11.200
 And this is how the same beings are continued.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:18.420
 And through this, again, here, Great Master said, through this, that power of the inward to the

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:19.200
 kind of the physical.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:26.400
 And we have the body, which is then, body, ourself, is based on the three chapter, three of those

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:27.200
 elements.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:30.200
 'za', 'long', and 'titties'.

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:33.200
 'Titties'. 'Za', 'long', 'titties'.

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:38.200
 'Za' is the principle root of the body, and 'long' is then 'win'.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:43.200
 So, channel, wind, essence, element, the body.

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:52.200
 And channel is the root of the body, and wind is the, the wind maintaining, as Great Master said.

00:14:52.200 --> 00:15:00.130
 It's all maintaining, but that is passage of the, that wind, which is travelling with the passage

00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:01.200
 of the channels,

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:07.200
 and mind is carrying throughout the channel, and every direction, this is.

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:13.200
 And then, and all that happening, even though there is nothing is really solid existing yet,

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:20.200
 but it's all happening on the surface level, or in the relative level, as dream.

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:23.200
 Magic dream, and all that happening.

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:28.200
 And now all that happening, and the same thing as samsara.

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:35.200
 And samsara, and six rims, all three rims, this is.

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:42.200
 And we are going unending, unending all the time, as water will.

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:45.200
 Water will, and that is how it is.

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:50.200
 That is general explanation, ideas of the samsara,

00:15:50.200 --> 00:16:00.200
 how diluted from same source, or same groan of the nirvana where it comes.

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:09.200
 And, and even we are wondering, in samsara like this, this, this is natural, is never affected.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:17.200
 Never ask before, if it is called Buddha natural, there is nothing really changed at all.

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:28.200
 That is current, I use the example, or the groan, foundation is never, never changed at all.

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:36.200
 Never changed, for that reason, for that reason, in the great tantra known as Tani,

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:40.200
 aqua-nipa tantra, is here where there are tantrums.

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:46.200
 And that tantra teaching said, all the sentient beings are the Buddha,

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:57.200
 yet they are governed by the obscurations, governed by obscurations temporarily, temporarily.

00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:03.200
 But that means, otherwise, everyone is the Buddha.

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:12.200
 As it is, this natural reality level, as it is, as that teaching said,

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:20.200
 every sentient being is ordinarily enlightened states, enlightened in three kaya states,

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:26.200
 dharmakaya, sambokaya, and dharmakaya states, they are already enlightened states.

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:32.200
 That nature of three kaya is glowing, glowing.

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:39.200
 Even we are completely deluded in this duality, that fabrication covered up that,

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:48.200
 but the nature of this three kaya is believed, is glowing, is believed.

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:59.200
 When we reach enlightenment, that three kaya, you just discover, you discover that time is, again,

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:00.200
 believed.

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:07.200
 I'm using those three words here, in the Tibetan word, "lummy," "lungly," and "lingy."

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:15.200
 Those are slightly different, but it shows that even in this power of time, it is glowing,

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:23.200
 if I use another word, it's glowing, and it is covered up.

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:30.200
 Even we are going all through these different difficulties, but still it's shining.

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:36.200
 And when we reach to the Buddhahood, it's still glowing, glowing.

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:39.200
 So it's the same thing, nothing really changed.

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:44.200
 It is just the nature, nothing changed.

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:52.200
 For that reason, this reason, this observation is removable.

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:56.200
 It is not ordinary, inherent.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:59.200
 It's not calm with nature.

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:02.200
 It is came as temporary.

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:10.200
 As when we are dreaming, nightmares, like for example, nightmares, it is not natural.

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:13.200
 It is temporary illusion.

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:20.200
 Therefore, we can wake up from nightmares, because it's not natural.

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:28.200
 Same thing, this whole experience, difficulty, challenge, it looks like so big, so deep, so strong,

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.200
 so wide.

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:35.200
 Yet, it is not natural.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:39.200
 This is not natural, therefore we can do it.

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.200
 That's the teaching.

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:43.200
 Nature is pure.

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:45.200
 Nature is believed.

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:50.200
 Nature is shining or radiating, "lingy," "lingy," "lingy."

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:54.200
 All these words are used, but I don't know exactly how to translate.

00:19:54.200 --> 00:20:01.200
 Maybe Eric's book has better, but I don't, it's just difficult.

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.200
 But anyway, so is it brilliant?

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:07.200
 Is it glowing?

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.200
 Is it shining?

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:09.200
 Is it brilliant?

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:11.200
 Oh, that's the word.

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:15.200
 So it's the same thing, nothing really going to change at all.

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:19.200
 Change, therefore, we walked exactly right way.

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:29.200
 According to nature itself, the call of nature itself, nature of our ground, nature of our mind,

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:38.200
 and we walked as that call it, line, call it, then it will lead us back to that nature,

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:41.200
 to that ground, or to that organ levels.

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:44.200
 And therefore, nature is the Buddha teaching.

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:47.200
 Always, what is the call of nature?

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:49.200
 It's love.

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.200
 It's compassion.

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:52.200
 It's wisdom.

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:57.200
 So those are the simple, again, there's so many bright kind of subdivisions can be said,

00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:03.200
 or that we went through those roughly, those 37, even there's more numbers, all that.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:13.200
 Those are the call of the true nature, or the radiating energy of the nature of our mind.

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:17.200
 And we kind of line up with that and follow that, explain it that,

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:22.200
 then we're following part of the nature with nature's qualities.

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:30.200
 That will then dispel the obscurations, the delusion that which is not natural.

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:34.200
 And that is one of removing obscurations.
