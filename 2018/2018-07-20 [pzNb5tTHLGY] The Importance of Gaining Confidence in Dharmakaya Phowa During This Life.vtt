00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.070
 The great great master of Phowa Rumbu said, or in other teachings too, is that generally there is

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:08.680
 many divisions of Phowa.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:21.940
 It's not just the five Phowa, there are a lot of varieties of divisions of Phowa, but the great

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:22.200
 master of Phowa Rumbu Ji and the Nintang Masters summarize all Phowa into five as we listed.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:32.780
 And those are Dharmakaya, Sammukaya, and then Makaya. And then for three intensions and help to the

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.400
 others, those are five Phoas.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:44.480
 And Dharmakaya Phowa is that, the Dharmakaya Phowa is the best, or this is the supreme Phoas.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:51.920
 Dharmakaya Phowa, there is a particular, for example, in Nama, what's called this, the three int

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.480
ensions of Phowa, explaining about where that consciousness lives,

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:04.880
 when we die, which is best to lead the consciousness. But Dharmakaya Phowa has no difference.

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.080
 Everything is the same.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:14.100
 Everything is Dharmakaya. Dharmakaya means not just a localized status. The whole is, whole

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.680
 universe, whole world, everything is within the Dharmakaya status.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.480
 There is no really difference at all. So there is, therefore, there is no need in the strengthens

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.880
 of the way, caution as well, the leap.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:38.200
 Leap is all Dharmakaya status. These Dharmakaya Phowa practices, as Sammukaya said, I said the

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.480
 other day, they is Dzogchen practitioners.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:50.310
 Dzogchen practitioners, Dzogchen has two practices that we all, known as, we are from the beginning

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.480
 practices of the Tuturi,

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:59.940
 and the serpentine is the leaping over practicing of the Togal practices. These both practices are

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.880
 Dzogchen practices.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:08.080
 How we can do these practices, that, of course, we all present, that has stopped so many times.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:15.380
 So there is nothing much to say. But it is, how to start is the same.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:26.650
 When Mr. Prakash said, three extension phowa, same, with joy and appreciation, both each other, and

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.680
 purely understanding.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:36.680
 All the three ways are same. We have to have that ground. Joy, appreciation, both each other,

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:43.280
 purity, understanding, or realization, any devotions, those are necessary.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:50.380
 Otherwise, even if you receive the Dzogchen teaching of the Tuturi and the Poga, it won't benefit.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:57.480
 It becomes intellectuals. Or maybe it becomes skeptical or suspicious.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:07.280
 Skeptical and suspicious and all that, then what? That means we are not really, have not settled.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:15.780
 We are not settled. We are shaking. Intellectual is, in Buddhism, very important.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:24.460
 You heard this with Buddha taught. Even Buddha himself said, "Don't rely on my word that what I

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:25.480
 said."

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:31.980
 But you should examine yourself, then if you feel it's true, you can then go there.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:39.380
 So that means, Buddha himself told to be intellectual. To analyze, intellectual is important.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:44.680
 But that, we should do that intellectually. That is when we are studying.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:53.220
 Starting time, we should be intellectual. Actual and thinking and analyzing, question and answer,

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.680
 all that.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:01.320
 Then what in Buddhism? The wisdom that comes from studying. So that is studying time. Then what

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.280
 comes from compilations?

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:10.100
 That time still you can linger it. You can discuss it. You can be intellectually analyzed and all

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.480
 that.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:18.880
 Compilating times, too. But then, around the counter-pollated time, and then when you come to the

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.080
 practice, or meditation, then you settle it.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.220
 That means, the practitioner said, "There is no more lingering, no more kind of thinking in the day

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.580
."

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:34.370
 Then if you start thinking in an intellectual way, it's more conceptions, more thought. It's not

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:35.480
 going to go any.

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:45.080
 It's that way. We are only kind of hovering in the surface. Not going deep. Just on the surface.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.280
 And it's not really going to break the resort. Big resort.

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:54.240
 I mean, you came, of course, in the teaching. He said, "Hearing the Buddha's teaching, definitely

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.480
 it has big benefits."

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:02.900
 Teaching. But I really like to get the benefit, as the teaching is mentioned, that won't come with

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.280
 an analytic and a skepticalness.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:16.470
 So it has to be there for this joy, appreciation, and then bodhicitta, unity, understanding,

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.280
 realization, devotion.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:25.280
 Those all combined together will absorb the teaching into the heart.

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:33.770
 And within the heart, as I said earlier, that nature is, then it merges to the nature. Then it

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.280
 breaks the resort.

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:41.560
 So it's the same. Now, when you resist that teaching, when you begin to practice, and practice is

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.280
 the same.

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:49.030
 Again, with the lineage prayers, the lineage prayers, bodhicitta, all those lineage prayers, taking

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:52.280
 bodhicitta, and also devotion prayers that we do.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.280
 Those all. And then meditate. Meditate.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:03.280
 A meditate has two meditations in a doki teaching, tokyo and a toga, as I said.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:11.580
 Tokyo meditation is then relaxing nature, mind in nature, sitting exactly as it is, without any

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.280
 constructions.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:18.280
 Constructions rest on the present status, as it is.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:24.380
 That means the present is not the present, but in the conceptual level. But what the teaching says,

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:26.280
 go beyond three times.

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:33.280
 Fast, present, and future. Go three times. And then relax. And that fourth time in the teaching.

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:38.280
 Relax in that status. Then simply relax in that natural state.

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:43.890
 And not follow in thought, not pursue in a thought, not remove in a thought, not analyze in a

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:46.280
 thought, simply relax.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:52.280
 All thought comes, let it come, let it go, be in the natural state.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:57.280
 Those are the natural thoughts and states. Those are the tokyo practices.

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:05.640
 So now, when you got the realization of the tokyo, this realization, what the realization of the

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:07.280
 true, a tokyo realization,

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:14.260
 is realizing the true nature that which is beyond the conception, beyond the world, beyond the

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:15.280
 language.

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:22.980
 That's what the greatest teacher, the great Master Chantalaki said, as he joined in the beginning

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:23.280
 of Heart Satra.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:31.280
 Inconceivable, unexpressed school, beyond the coming and the going, but naturally the sky,

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:37.280
 experienced by only one's own pristine awareness cognitions.

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:41.280
 That is the realization of the tokyo.

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:48.280
 There is nothing, anything, kind of restrictions, any regulators or holding or the focus.

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:52.280
 It just provides total freedom, freedom status.

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:58.270
 So this is, when you got this realization, it is like exactly, exactly as it is when you got

00:07:58.270 --> 00:07:59.280
 realization.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:06.680
 That time, according in the teaching, you are already in a Dharmakaya power status, Dharmakaya

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:07.280
 power status.

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:15.280
 That individual, no need to do any of that because you are already in a Dharmakaya status.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:19.280
 Status, status and that ultimate state of power.

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:26.280
 And then, together with these two practices, toka practices, the tokyo toka practices.

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:31.280
 That is like, revealing the quality of the nature of the mind.

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.280
 The nature of the mind is what?

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:39.280
 When you look to the nature of the mind, it is beyond the conception, as I said.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:44.280
 That is the teaching said and that is something we also experience when we meditate.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:49.280
 It is beyond the concept, there is nothing to do, hold or label anything, that is nature.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:53.280
 But that nature is not just a blank emptiness status.

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:58.280
 It is full of vitality, full of clarity.

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:03.280
 So breathe, meditate on that clarity.

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:11.200
 That is toka practices, simple to tell. Clarity or the light that building qualities, toka

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.280
 practices.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:16.280
 And then, when you practice toka, resilience, stroke and toka practice,

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:24.280
 all universe and everything is transformed or see as rainbow light, rainbow space, rainbow space.

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:28.280
 This rainbow light is not just coming from out.

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:36.280
 According to the Doki teaching, it is emerging from our nature of the river or the awareness.

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:45.280
 That clarity of the river, transformed or that see that everything is just as rainbow light.

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:50.280
 When you have that realization, also in this lifetime,

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:57.960
 if you are already in the greatest dasudendre, lustre, huwa status, huwa status, ultimate state of

00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:58.280
 all,

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.280
 you have your realization.

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:05.280
 In the Doki, Poga, Poga teaching said those different stages, whatever, you got that realization.

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:10.280
 Then, already you reach that state, you don't have to direct this and that.

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:15.110
 Everything becomes as in light of your land, of the discipline, of the dasudendre, of the visible

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:16.280
 rainbow.

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:19.280
 So you are already in light of state.

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:22.280
 That is known as the Dharmakaya Poas.

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:29.280
 But then somehow, we had that realization, let it be, but not exactly that completely fulfilled.

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.280
 Exactly that status in this lifetime.

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:40.280
 Then, this Dharmakaya Poa is, there is a big opportunity to get the Dharmakaya Poa status.

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:46.280
 Yes, moment of death or just at the time of the death in the teaching.

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:52.280
 Then, according, again we told that, I mean the teaching said, what that worked out.

00:10:52.280 --> 00:11:00.280
 It said, for example, when we passing away, there is so many different signs externally,

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:04.280
 all that merging from one to another, to all one after another going,

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:13.280
 and the end, toward the end of the merging, our two elements, particularly that element,

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:17.280
 that we obtained from our parents.

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:22.280
 White element and red element, that is going to merge.

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:30.280
 They're not going to, prison time, their element, that essence element is all of the voting.

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:32.280
 It's not just 180.

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:38.440
 But particularly, the central location of the, those focal point of the, location of the white

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:39.280
 element,

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:43.280
 according to the teaching, that we, which we obtained from our father,

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:46.280
 is residing mainly on the current jakras.

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:52.280
 And the particularly red element that we received from our mother, that essence,

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:58.280
 that essence is residing mainly in the below, never centuries, when we're alive.

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:05.280
 But when we are dying, that time, all elements are dissolved, merging one after another.

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:09.280
 So then, these two elements are also losing our positions.

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:12.280
 They're not going to say where it used to be.

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.280
 It is going to merge.

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:20.280
 That, in the teaching said, and that focus is, is the father element,

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:27.280
 the white element is coming down from the current jakras, is a descendant, descendant.

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:32.280
 At that time, what is the inner visions in the teaching said?

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:44.280
 Individual experience, all is like flash, flash, flash light, white light, flash, flash, flash.

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:54.280
 And then, when the red element is losing the position, is outward, is it ascending?

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:56.280
 Is it ascending outward?

00:12:56.280 --> 00:13:03.650
 That time, that individually there were experience, the current teaching all become reddish, red

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:05.280
 experience.

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:11.740
 This generally, this red and white, again in the teaching said, those practitioner, toga

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:13.280
 practitioners,

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:17.280
 when they see the light practice, this, this is a display.

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:21.280
 It's not really happening in big things, it's just an inner vision.

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:27.280
 And therefore, toga practice, that they connect immediately, that is a display of the request,

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:35.280
 that one's own awareness, then they can reach, they can reach to the dharmakaya status, status.

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:41.280
 When these two elements are merged, come up, one is coming up, one is coming down,

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:46.280
 then it comes to the beatman, beatman, our consciousness.

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:49.280
 Consciousness, according to Buddhism, is in heart center.

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:57.280
 So now, these two elements are trapped, to, trapped the consciousness.

00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:00.280
 So that means, come to lock it.

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:09.020
 White came down, came down, red come up, and in between, our own consciousness is completely

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:10.280
 trapped.

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:19.280
 That moment, what that individual is experiencing, according, completely become blank, dark,

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:25.280
 all blank, completely can't avoidness, completely appeared.

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:30.280
 Keep it. That means, that happening, that how long that lasts?

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:37.280
 In the teaching said, maybe one instant, it won't stay long.

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:44.280
 Average, it won't stay. And then, it will, that force will lose, lose.

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:50.280
 And these two elements are parting, in a way, kind of separated, in a way, separate.

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:58.280
 That moment, the consciousness is completely become, waked up, in a way, it's coming, waking up.

00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:04.280
 That moment, that instant, according to Dokriti or the inner center, everyone said,

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:09.280
 that time, experience is a Dharmakaya experience.

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:17.280
 There is no, any blockades, brilliant, clay, as like autumn sky.

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:23.280
 Autumn sky is what, in the teaching said, is free from dust, free from the dust of,

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:30.280
 so free from the dust, free from the dust of the, of the water, and free from of the, of the cloud

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:31.280
ed mists.

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:35.280
 That time, autumn sky is so brilliant.

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:43.280
 Similarly, that experience is brilliant vastness, experience, one can't.

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:51.280
 That is, when you shine, that is, that is known as the ordinary nature of the, the great emptiness

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:53.280
 or the Dharmakaya.

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:57.280
 As one, those practitioners, when they practice the meditative, when they experience,

00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:03.280
 for example, two, two practices, now that time, really they recognize, oh, that is the nature.

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:08.280
 So they, what they, they know, what is shining is completely merged.

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:15.280
 And that is known as meeting the mother and the child, luminosity token, completely merged.

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:22.280
 That moment, that individual is totally, again, digital Dharmakaya status.

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:26.280
 Dharmakaya question, that is Dharmakaya status.

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:32.280
 And somehow, that individual is not reached in life, but there, there.

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:35.280
 But there are good practices, you know, Toga.

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:44.460
 Toga, right after that, then there is the display or the gauntlet of the awareness will shine, g

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:45.280
auntlet.

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:53.280
 And that is the coming as from the, like sunlight or the northern light, northern light coming.

00:16:53.280 --> 00:17:00.280
 And those are the what, in the teachings said, sound, light and the beams of light.

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:03.280
 Light is kind of coming, coming.

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:09.560
 At that moment, those people who are practicing, who practice Toga in his life, immediately

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:10.280
 recognize,

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:14.280
 is not coming from anywhere, is one's own display of the raka, raka.

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:23.280
 And recognize that and merging it with or as a, as a interference as you want it to be relaxed,

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:23.280
 object to object.

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:25.280
 Immediately merge it through that.

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:29.280
 At that moment, they reach for some Dharmakaya status.

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:38.280
 So these both are known as, that all known as Dharmakaya focus in the teaching stage.

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:40.280
 All is Dharmakaya.

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:45.280
 One, the first one is reach Dharmakaya state within these lifetimes.

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:53.100
 But somehow that didn't happen and then they moved, they reach Dharmakaya status in the, just right

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:54.280
 after that or that.

00:17:54.280 --> 00:18:00.280
 And those sign of those, those who reach Dharmakaya status, they can meditate for many days.

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:06.280
 Those people who are meditating after they died, those are the according teaching,

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:09.280
 they are reached Dharmakaya state of the Toga.

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:11.280
 They are able to meditate.

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:15.280
 Their body, the complexion is not changed.

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:19.280
 And it's not so fresh or maybe even become more fresh than their lives.

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:25.280
 And so beautiful body become flexible or some, it depends individually.

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:30.280
 I mean that flexible, brilliant, those are the inwardly signs.

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:35.890
 Outer signs are building the sky, rainbow light and then the song and all those things in the

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:37.280
 teaching stage.

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:43.280
 Those are the outer signs, sign of the reaching to them Dharmakaya Toga status.

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:45.280
 So that is the best.

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:47.280
 The second one is,
