00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.830
 So, my question is about "crazy wisdom." Of course, this word comes up a lot, not only in his sadh

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:11.000
ana, but in Buddhism.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.420
 And I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more about what "crazy wisdom" is. Is it

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.000
 similar to the wrathful emanations? Is it distinct?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:31.380
 And also too, maybe this question goes into devotion as well. How do we as students relate to the "

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.000
crazy wisdom" that's trying to benefit us?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:46.880
 Okay, "crazy wisdom" means that that means that individuals who are performing those activities is,

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:53.000
 I mean, quite good enlightened, really high enlightened, quite high enlightened.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 As those, for example, those thetums, mere yogis. So, that means wisdom. That means wisdom yogis.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.800
 Now, their activities become, let it be, regularities in the normal conceptual levels. That's what

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.000
 then is named "crazy wisdom."

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.790
 Because in our common conceptual level, in the common kind of tradition and system, their

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.000
 activities become regularities.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:34.420
 But, therefore, it's called "crazy wisdom activities." But, however, when they relate truly "crazy

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:40.000
 wisdom" activity, that is not going to hurt anyone.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.570
 It certainly is inspiring, inspiring, deepening their devotion, deepening their meditation,

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:56.220
 deepening their practices, and deepening their understanding of the meaning or teaching of the

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.000
 Dharma.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 That activity is known as "crazy wisdom activities."

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:11.990
 Ever activity and something that is named as "crazy wisdom activity" yet is hurting someone,

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:19.000
 disturbing someone, and is not really benefiting anyone, is against with the teaching.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.720
 That is even named as "crazy wisdom activity." It's not "crazy wisdom activity," just using that

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.000
 terminology.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 So, it's not "crazy wisdom activities," activities. So, that is really the difference.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 And that is, for example, "Gurubhe Masambha" is many activities named as "crazy wisdom activities."

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:51.550
 "Gurubhe Masambha" activity is old, there is nothing really hurting anyone, and it is inspired, it

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:58.000
 is developed, those practices are highly enlightened status.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 And so, therefore, it is truly "crazy wisdom activities."
