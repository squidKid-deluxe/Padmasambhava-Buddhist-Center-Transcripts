00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.240
 Prosperity for the path will give the receipt nothing like one who enjoys the food and wealth

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:17.380
 in the painting. Paintings. So, here's the one who don't have the qualifications. Maybe

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.320
 they don't have the joyful effort. They don't have the also courage and commitment. They

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.360
 don't have and are also kind of like interested, the motivation to explore the teaching. They

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:33.080
 are completely kind of like blocked of those things, call it this and not even crush these

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:39.280
 things and that and then and as well as also even they have some idea of the joy in the

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.120
 application of courage. They don't have the joyful effort. So, they don't really pursue

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:51.200
 and don't discover due to the laziness laziness and then also they don't keep in the mind

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:58.720
 and don't also this and that means mindfulness is also really not active and because of all

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:06.200
 those not interested motivations all that this reason those people those individuals

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:12.540
 even teaching is right in front of you then it's not treating you even you heard teaching

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.800
 it won't help. It won't help you because it's not going to absorb to the heart. Heart and

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:26.840
 mind and so then it's just like as a like painting of the food and the wealth on the

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:34.400
 painting. It's just not going to relieve the wealth. It won't become the reach by having

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:40.040
 painting on the well or there is a food put on the on the magazines or something is not

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:48.640
 going to make food tummy. So, it's just it's not it's not there's nothing to be lost with

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:55.600
 it or nothing to begin. It's just for them. And this is like many times they use the examples

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:02.480
 who don't have connection and don't have the motivation is the same thing. If you throw

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:12.000
 the big nugget of gold right in front of the doggy and the doggy don't care at all. And

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.960
 you throw that a bone and he will be oh he or she will be very happy. And so many times

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:27.800
 we use examples. Throw the gold oh throw the throw the glass in front of the of the of the

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:37.400
 drop not going to pay attention. If you throw glass hey hey h-a-y hey throw and if you throw

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:44.440
 a piece of bone to the in front of the cow not going to pay attention. So, this is like

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:52.720
 that. And then so that's it. But those who have coverability that those who have really

00:02:52.720 --> 00:03:01.320
 high coverability here 14 ones then with the opposite of that a 14 one who have this in

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:08.240
 the spirit of the activity spirit and for that then the sky to your true nature compound

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:16.240
 as inherent inherent. So those who are really have the polynomial connect with teaching they're

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:23.600
 eager to learn eager to receive and very enthusiastic to to the teaching and the practices and then

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:29.720
 for them and also keep that enthusiasm and the courage and commitment contribute not

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:37.320
 yourself only one time or short time of these two weeks but keep that continually keeping

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:47.080
 and what in the teaching said the joyful effort is not stopped or not to change it the continually

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:54.680
 flowing as a river. River, continually flowing as a river. River, river don't stop for day

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:03.480
 and the night. Night is continually flowing. This is joyful effort and the commitment, courage

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:09.560
 to the Dharma practices is something that we continue to follow. This practice of Dharma

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:15.360
 is not just we are doing to please in the buddhas or the lineage of masters we are doing

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:24.160
 the practice to our self to benefit our self and the benefit of other beings all the beings

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:30.720
 all the infinite beings that's what really we're doing so we have practicing is not just a kind

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:36.840
 of like casual in a support it's a really big goal if we keep up the identity of the practices

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:45.080
 this is the one of the marvelous goal that we can do to benefit ourself that means what?

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:52.880
 When you practice the Dharma it really brings our mind become more common more peaceful more

00:04:52.880 --> 00:05:04.520
 practical in the samsara full of common sense and mindfulness too those all will help us

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:13.880
 to produce our lives they will help to our friendship with our friends and families in

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:22.360
 the group really this is that is Dharma as much as we practice Dharma if those are growing

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:28.920
 and developing then the practice is going to the right directions and somehow we practice

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:36.320
 Dharma and those are not growing and become more kind of like uncensible more unpractical

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:43.520
 more wired that means Dharma is not going exactly right way so therefore we have to

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:51.960
 be adjusted by that seeing those things by ourself so therefore this is then for those

00:05:51.960 --> 00:06:01.280
 of whole generation this teaching came as inherent so that is
