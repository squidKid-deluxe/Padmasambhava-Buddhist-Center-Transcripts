00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.280
 First, the creation stage of the practices of the visualization is practicing on the relative truth

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:08.620
.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:15.120
 Because nature has two, every kind of thing of everything in nature, there is two.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:22.640
 That's what the Buddha taught, relative truth and absolute truth, these are the two truths.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:29.980
 And that encompasses everything, there is nothing that is out of that, that's the way nature is.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:36.980
 Now practicing, getting enlightenment, we like to make everything as an enlightened status.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:44.970
 Not just one side and this side. Everything. That means we like to get enlightenment, relative

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.880
 truth, we like to be in the enlightened status.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:55.080
 And absolute truth be also enlightened status. These two are inseparable.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:02.570
 Relative truth, there is no single, independent, relative truth beside absolute truth, there is no

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.680
 single, independent, existing absolute truth beside relative truth.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.960
 This is completely inseparable state. Inseparable state is what in Dzogchen teaching and Vajrayana

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.680
 teaching, known as Great Union.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.680
 The union, the united, the union cannot be separated, is it this?

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.280
 As they use the example, fire and it is heat. Fire, it is warm.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:37.280
 We cannot put fire without warm, warm without fire. That cannot be separated.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.280
 If it is fire, it is inseparable, both are there.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.280
 Similarly, these two truths are, exactly that.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:53.280
 First down, our two truths are deluded by the dualities. We don't see this enlightened status.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:01.100
 Now through the Vajrayana teaching, instantly we are really going to connect in a discovery. It is

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.280
 an enlightened state.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:09.280
 Relative truth is enlightened, absolute truth is enlightened, both are inseparable states.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.280
 That is the Vajrayana teaching, it is a discovery.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:20.280
 Vajrayana teaching is fast, quick and very comfortable and speed.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.280
 Vajrayana teaching is therefore, that's what they call diamond path, diamond weakness.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.280
 It is the same as in the win-win, big traffic games.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:39.280
 There is what is called diamond line lines, diamond line, lane, diamond line.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:48.280
 Devil lane is faster, speed, comfortable and you move but with qualification.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.280
 Not just immediately jump there, there, with qualification.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.280
 If you have to qualify, if you move there, it is really fast.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.280
 Fastness moves and it will lead you to your destination faster.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:10.280
 Similarly, this doki teaching is, is an Vajrayana teaching or Vajrayana teaching is fast and speed.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.280
 So now we are talking back again to this topic.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:20.480
 The creative state and the completion state or creative state of visualization, complete state of

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.280
 dissolution.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.280
 That is why I use the terminology. These two stages.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:34.510
 So this, this creative state of the visualization, immediately we transcendent, transforming this

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.280
 relative truth into enlightenment states.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.280
 Immediately we are transformed.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:48.280
 What we are going to write? We are going to write poem, we are going to write song, song.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.280
 We meditate on the poem, we meditate on the poem.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.280
 Immediately we are really transcendent.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.280
 That form and song has enlightened status, state.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.280
 That is known as the essence meaning of the visualization.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:10.280
 In order to do this, we are immediately provoking our, this primordial wisdom.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:17.280
 As I said, when I taught in doki teaching, the three kaya, primordial wisdom, let that reflect it

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.280
 in the form of a Buddha.

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.280
 Because primordial wisdom has no restrictions.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.280
 Primordial wisdom is kept free, not regulated.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.280
 As you desire, that is what we are actualizing.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.280
 That we can, we really can tell in the dreams.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.280
 Dreams is all mental provocations.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:46.280
 As we think, as we motivate it, that's what the dream is coming, mostly.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.280
 Reflect that to the channels and coming out of the dreams.

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:55.280
 Same way, this one, this time more organized way, primordial wisdom.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.280
 Now let that begin our primordial wisdom, our awareness.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.280
 Let that begin being in the Buddha.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:09.280
 In this dead moment, then you are in the dead Buddha's hands.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:18.280
 See, your primordial wisdom, our primordial wisdom instantly went off and that Buddha, Buddha.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:24.740
 And that Buddha is then such as the Buddha Vedasathas, Buddha Vedakalas, all Gauravimas, Buddha

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.280
 Shaktamuni, whatever.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.280
 We instantly become that.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:36.520
 So what that means we become in that state of our form is become that status of the Buddha, not

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.280
 just only our form.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:44.300
 We are going to say environment, all the forms, all that our eyesight have become enlightened

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:45.280
 status.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:54.280
 So instantly you bring up all this in that enlightened status, the old forms.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.280
 And then we are going to recite in the mantras.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:02.670
 And that moment, not just only recite ourselves, but the whole sound system of the universe is now

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:06.280
 waking up to the sound of enlightenment.

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:13.280
 Right? Keeping up that thought, kind of meditation strongly in our heart and mind.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:22.390
 And that is known as it really transforming relative truth of this type of things into the

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:25.280
 enlightened state, Buddha status.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.280
 Status. So that is really all that.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.280
 Now we think about this complete status.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.280
 It is dealing with more direct focus to the mind.

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:38.280
 And this is also known as absolute truth, absolute truth.

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:43.280
 And that also absolute truth is already enlightened state too, enlightened state.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.280
 That's what we are talking.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:47.280
 Our nature of the mind is Thirikaya status already.

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:53.840
 Now you bring up that realization to discover that inner nature and then deeper it in as Zokki

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:54.280
 status,

00:06:54.280 --> 00:07:06.280
 or such as known as inseparably purity and emptiness token and meditate on that status.

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:12.280
 Status. Such as as we dissolve, all the dissolved states too, as we dissolve meditate.

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:19.280
 That will bring up quickly our mind or even as enlightened state as it is.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.280
 And then both are inseparable.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:26.970
 So creating a stage of the visualization and a complete stage of the dissolve state in a separable

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:27.280
 state.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.280
 They are not really divided separately.

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:33.280
 It is same because it is the nature of everything.

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:38.280
 So therefore this very inner teaching is so powerful, so spiritual.

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:45.030
 When we practice, very inner practice that really immediately go to the Zokki state as complete

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:46.280
 stage of practices.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:51.280
 And then at the same time, we are also activating all this, our weakness.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:58.730
 And instead the object of our eye or our sight and our ears are ascending into the enlightened

00:07:58.730 --> 00:07:59.280
 state.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:08.840
 And therefore, very inner teaching is considered in more powerful practices and as well as Zokki is

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.280
 very inner teaching.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:13.280
 And also reaching enlightenment in very inner teaching.

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:19.060
 Yet in the Buddha teaching he said, by the Soka practices, reaching enlightenment, it will take

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:20.280
 three countless eons.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:24.280
 Also there is some division, three countless eons.

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:27.280
 But very inner teaching is about the outer tender practices.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:33.610
 You will practice of the outer tender, not just three countless eons, but just a matter of the lif

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:34.280
etimes.

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:43.390
 And the seven lifetimes, or sixty lifetimes, or sixty lifetimes, seventy lifetimes, and three lif

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:44.280
etimes.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:52.280
 And in another practice such as Mahayoga, Anayoga, and Adiyoga practice, within these lifetimes.

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:53.280
 So reaching enlightenment.

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:58.400
 So therefore, since it is so powerful, we put the practice with joyful, joyful courage and

00:08:58.400 --> 00:08:59.280
 commitment, with devotion.

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:06.250
 Therefore, really, the result comes quite fast because we are chatting to the goal of the nature

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:07.280
 and the heart of the enlightened immediately.

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:11.280
 So that's what we talk. Thank you.

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:15.280
 Now Mr. Ok, a little bit, so we talk tomorrow. Thank you.
