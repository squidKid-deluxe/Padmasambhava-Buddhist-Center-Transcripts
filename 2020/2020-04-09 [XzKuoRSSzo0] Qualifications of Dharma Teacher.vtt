00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.700
 Thank you again. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you so much. You are welcome, everyone.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:17.900
 Again, we are going to show up, go to show, breathe, and teachings from the Dharma of Buddha.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:25.300
 And for that reason, again, we are going to reactivate our spiritual motivation of the joy and

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.700
 appreciation,

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:37.200
 vastness, motivation of the Bodhijata, and then realization of the vision of the Vaidyama sitting,

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:46.200
 of the free readiness of our perfect realization, trying to bring all those as much as we can,

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.700
 and with those with our motivation, then we reflect on the teachings.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:58.300
 The teaching that we have been talking about, again, is Guru's teaching, His Holiness,

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:04.100
 Jyabhir Munirumaji teaching, as well as instructors to the 14th ones.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.700
 We are following that teaching, and I am going to let details of each point,

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:19.620
 because, basically, all of us, this Mayo force, thought that if we all heard teaching from many

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.500
 great masters,

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:33.520
 as well as we read many books, but all those are so good, which is known as the starting of the

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.500
 Buddhism, Buddha teaching.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:42.710
 And then, along with that, I am sure you all did, or you all did some reading of contemplation on

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:43.100
 those,

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:49.300
 which is also wonderful. Those are known as the wisdom that comes from the study,

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.300
 the wisdom that comes from the contemplation, contemplating.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:03.320
 Now, what we need, we have to observe with that our knowledge, our understanding of the teaching

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.300
 into heart,

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:14.300
 and activating the realization. Dharma has to be mingled with the mind.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:23.300
 It is not just that Dharma has to be intellectual status. Dharma has to be mingled to the heart.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:30.300
 When you mingled the Dharma to the heart, what is the teaching? As we join, or we pray many times,

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:39.300
 may my realization will mature my own mind. We have to mature our mind.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:48.300
 For that reason, the great teacher, Buddha said, "Tame our mind, tame your mind."

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:54.300
 "Tame your mind" means mature our mind.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:03.300
 Birthday time, our mind is not matured, and our mind is not tamed.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.300
 Why? Because of all the different negative emotions.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.300
 We went those quite few details, and again, of course, we all know.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.300
 That negative emotion is hovering in our mental state always.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:24.300
 Tendence is ignorance. Tendence is grasping and clinging.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:29.300
 Now we have to change that, try to change that.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:34.300
 You know, to what? The more natural positive mind.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:40.300
 And that, when we try to do that, that is known as really practicing Dharma.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:45.300
 You see, Dharma is not coming from outside someone, according to Buddhism.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.300
 Dharma is something we activate in our own nature.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:57.300
 Kindness, compassion, love, your wisdom, those are the values we need.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:04.800
 So therefore, in order to do this, to make more that strong and more tangible, more rooted in our

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.300
 heart,

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:12.300
 that is known as practicing, practicing, or meditating, and practicing.

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:20.300
 That is also known as then following the path of the teachings, path of truth.

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:30.300
 We are making many times that all teachings can be summarized into the whole novel through this.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.300
 Suffering truth, cause of suffering truth, those we wish.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.300
 Those are samsaras.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.300
 Suffering truth, cause of suffering truth is samsara.

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:49.300
 Now we like to change that to the neurons.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:54.300
 In order to do it in Nirvana, we have to follow the path of truth.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:00.300
 Path of truth is also same as another terminology, is good karma.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.300
 It is good things.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:10.300
 Good karma is the process of following the path of truth.

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:16.300
 Now it will go for the path of truth, what is the teaching of the samsara?

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:27.700
 You have to be thinking of the benefit of the Naranas, or the enlightenment, or the benefit of the

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.300
 spiritual qualities.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:41.300
 Dharma, Dharma is again, I said so many times, and we all know, is our nature of the mind.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:47.300
 Love and kindness is Dharma. Compassion is Dharma.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.300
 Wisdom is Dharma.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:57.300
 All combination of love and compassion, wisdom, those are really known as Dharma.

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:04.550
 When we cultivate that in the mind, in the heart, and the activity, that is known as practicing the

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:05.300
 Dharma.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:13.300
 And then, of course, gracious teacher, kindness teacher, Buddha, kind of a man, more simple, more

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:13.300
 easy,

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:19.300
 that we can target, that he put very beautiful guidelines, and follow those instructions,

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:24.300
 then really we will discover our inner nature.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:30.300
 And that is, then what it does, it will remove the difficulty tuples.

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:35.300
 All the difficulty tuples that we go through, it will be put in part.

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.300
 It will play with that.

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:44.300
 We will gain more wisdom, knowledge, and understand, more openness of mind.

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:49.300
 And then at the same time, more love, more kindness, and compassion.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.300
 All that will come.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:57.300
 Even there may be some difficulty tuples that come up there, but we have more, better understanding

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:57.300
,

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:04.300
 knowledge, and wisdom, skills, to solve all those problems so nicely, easily.

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:10.300
 Not just that, but we will transform those tuples into the practice part,

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:15.300
 to activate more of our courage and commitment, confidence.

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:16.300
 Use that.

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:21.300
 As, for example, these days, we are using this situation as a circumstance.

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:28.300
 Many of us, as a personal retreat, group retreat, all virtue retreat.

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.300
 We all know using those skillful means.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.300
 Means to activate it, what is it?

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:41.300
 To activate it, to let it go, to bring true vision of really our inner quality,

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:47.140
 of the beautiful quality of love, and compassion, devotion, and connection to the Buddha Dharma San

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:47.300
gha.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:53.300
 And feel the meaning of life, more calm, more peaceful, not writing all the time.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.300
 We are doing those things.

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:58.300
 Those old, beautiful tools will come.

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:02.300
 For example, this time, the situation is so kind of very old,

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:05.300
 kind of tight up and close to everything.

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:12.300
 But if there is a Dharma, then we can use it as retreat, personal retreat.

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:20.300
 Each time, those great masters practice retreat on the mountain, in hermitage.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.300
 That's what they call it.

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:26.300
 The kind of hermitage is made because of busyness,

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:33.300
 not allowing to grasp the relaxed state of mind and discover our inner realization.

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:37.300
 For that reason, they go to the hermitage.

00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:42.300
 But in these days, even the situation, the circumstances are allowing them.

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:45.300
 They are created there, even in the city.

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:48.300
 We are hermitage in a way.

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:50.300
 Which is according to the Buddha's point of view,

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:57.300
 is really we are taking meaningful lives, meaningful lives, taking advantage of this,

00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:01.300
 something that we use in that,

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:07.300
 and to grow and develop our loving kindness, compassion, our body together.

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:09.300
 It's a wonderful situation.

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:12.300
 For that reason, the great Master Moojima said,

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:14.300
 and one of his teachings said,

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:18.300
 "When difficulty troubles or the heart situation fails,

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:22.300
 it allows me to do the practice, to meditate.

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:29.300
 So therefore, I am thankful to those obstacles, the heart things."

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:33.300
 He let many verses of that one after another, he thanked,

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:36.300
 to all those difficulty troubles.

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:44.300
 So when we looked at all those great Masters who got high in their realizations,

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:47.300
 that they all went big in the tunnels.

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:55.300
 Many difficulties, troubles, hearts, but they turned that into practice,

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:59.300
 and turned into dharma, that they become more correct,

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:04.300
 more commitment, more confidence, more passion,

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:10.300
 then truly they become the winner in the samsara, they become the beacon.

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:19.300
 They filled their heart with love, compassion, joy, and peaceful.

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:24.300
 And they radiated that energy of love and compassion to all the living beings.

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:28.300
 They are not really depressed and can't resent the force,

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:35.300
 and can't be all blaming them, always calm, peaceful, love.

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:41.300
 That's what is known as courageous ones or the bodhisattvas.

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:48.300
 So in order to do this, thinking of that, those all come provided by the practicing dharma.

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:52.300
 That is really what is all developed from the dharma,

00:10:52.300 --> 00:11:00.300
 all is developed from the discovery, inner quality, or the beauty of our own nature.

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:02.300
 That is really what happened.

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:05.300
 For that reason, always in the teaching making,

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:13.300
 in order to do that, then it is always important to have qualified teachers.

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:16.300
 Qualified teachers are important.

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:21.300
 The other teacher is important to every knowledge, every status.

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:26.300
 Even your genius, still you need teaching.

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:29.300
 There is no historicals.

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:37.300
 I think maybe any mankind, the gain, the knowledge without any teachers.

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:42.300
 Doesn't matter, knowledge of samsara, knowledge of the dharma,

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:46.300
 all they gain, somebody they have to have some teacher,

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:52.300
 some personal kind of like assistant or inspirations from others.

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:57.300
 That activated those genius kind of so suddenly, so quickly.

00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:03.300
 Maybe they don't, not maybe, they don't, those genius don't have to go hard

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:09.300
 starting in this long time, but something such small cliques have to happen

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:13.300
 with personal inspiration and contact.

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:17.300
 That's how, and therefore they are always in the teaching.

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:21.300
 See, the teacher is so important.

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:28.300
 To read, until the Buddha, according to Buddhism, you need teacher, always, person.

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:33.300
 Teacher is also in Buddhism known as spiritual friend.

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:39.300
 It's not something that is boss or something kind of like potatoes

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:45.300
 or something kind of like celiac watches, but it's personal friend.

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:51.300
 You are personal friend, you're going to get along the path, along the journey

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:56.300
 with love and with respect and the appreciation to each other

00:12:56.300 --> 00:13:00.300
 and moving forward, to the enlightenment.

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:06.300
 And therefore, that teacher, for that reason, always said it's important.

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:11.300
 For that reason, I talked really about, again, about the teachers.

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:18.300
 Now, if we're talking to the teachers, generally, there is a variety of the teachers

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:23.300
 in the dance, but it comes to summarize what the teaching said.

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:27.300
 There are three kinds of teachers we can summarize.

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:35.300
 The ordinary teachers, and the related teachers, or the bodhisattva teachers,

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:38.300
 and the Buddha.

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:42.300
 Those are the three kinds of principal teachers,

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:50.300
 ordinary teachers in a debate called social theories, regular average things.

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:57.300
 But still, these all need qualification, particularly the ordinary teachers.

00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:00.300
 Collaboration, those are the greatest teachers.

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:04.300
 Buddha mentioned all the different teachings, so many.

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:10.300
 And as well as all the great masters, also mentioned the collaboration of teachers.

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:14.300
 One, I'm not really making it.

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:20.300
 But I go really, really, really of those qualifications.

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:22.300
 Or maybe, yes, two different.

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:24.300
 Two, our goal.

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:25.300
 Two.

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:30.300
 One is our goal according to the international qualifications.

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:36.300
 And the other is the average of the Mahayana qualifications, as I explained.

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:38.300
 Very simple words.

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:43.300
 Firstly, in other qualifications, in the teaching set,

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:54.300
 one holds three triangles, and attends all the nectals.

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:58.300
 So three and four, that makes four.

00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:01.300
 Three triangles, one, two, three.

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:06.300
 And the whole nectals, four.

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:19.300
 And then the fifth one is one whose very responsibilities.

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:24.300
 Another one is, I think, six, right?

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:30.300
 Six is now one who also understands the nectals.

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:41.300
 And then the seventh is one who also knows the ritual ceremonies.

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:46.300
 Or ritual, ritual implements, or ritual.

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:54.300
 And the eighth one is one who has linear realizations.

00:15:54.300 --> 00:16:06.300
 So those are the eight principal qualities of the, as explained, inner nectals.

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:11.300
 So what are those first three triangles?

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:15.300
 Triangles of the will.

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:16.300
 Will.

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:25.300
 Will that understanding of the old relative are as pure as divine mandalas.

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:32.300
 And of that, in a relative, absolute level is completely as emptiness,

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:36.300
 pure from the beginning, or great economic status.

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:42.300
 So realization of the purity and the equanimity in the United Union State,

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:47.300
 that is the will.

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:50.300
 Will, that is the first triangle.

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:55.300
 Second triangle is meditation.

00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:57.300
 Traleo of meditation.

00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:05.300
 Meditation of the visualization, meditation of the completion stage.

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:09.300
 United target again understands.

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:10.300
 Under target.

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:12.300
 That triangle holds.

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:17.300
 So that means also has realization of something.

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:21.300
 Third triangle is conduct.

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:24.300
 Traleo of the conduct.

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:32.300
 And keeping up the general and the particular Samayas.

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:33.300
 Samayas.

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:39.300
 And that is the third triangle.

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:43.300
 And the fourth one who holds the nectar.

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:45.300
 Fourth one is the nectar.

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:47.300
 I also translate as nectar.

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:52.300
 Otherwise, also in the teaching, say the dream of the river.

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:53.300
 Dream.

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:56.300
 D-A-M-P, I believe.

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:58.300
 Dream of the river.

00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:04.300
 So river of the lineage teaching who hold, whole lineage river.

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:10.300
 All the empowerments, transmissions, blessings.

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:14.300
 Those who hold the river, that one you hold.

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:18.300
 Or the nectar.

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:24.300
 The fifth one is, is the responsibilities.

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:29.300
 Responsibility of the keeping, not neglecting of the Vedayana teaching.

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:37.300
 Same time neglecting those who are interested, devoted students or practitioners.

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:42.300
 Helping and supporting, keeping up that.

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:46.300
 That is the fifth one.

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:54.300
 The sixth one is understanding of the Tantalas.

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:56.300
 Meaning of the Tantalas, what means Tantalas.

00:18:56.300 --> 00:19:03.300
 And also their detailed teachings and explaining of the Tantalas teachings.

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:09.300
 Or one who have already explained the teachings.

00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:13.300
 And the seventh is ritual ceremonies.

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:20.300
 Or the ritual of it, such as young girls or orphans, murderers.

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:27.300
 And then all the different implements of the Vedayana teachings.

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:29.300
 And also know that.

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:32.300
 Or the pyrabudyas.

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:36.300
 Retraining different orphans, all of them.

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:44.300
 The final one is one who hold leading teaching and got some realizations.

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:48.300
 Realizations of the pit instructions.

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:55.300
 Something warm, calm, peaceful, love, kindness, compassion.

00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:59.300
 Matured their mind and heart and gentle.

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:03.300
 And followed again exactly the instruction.

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:06.300
 What they teach one thing and do something.

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:07.300
 No.

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:12.300
 Kind of line up what they say and what they do.

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:14.300
 What they're teaching, what they're doing.

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:17.300
 Kind of line up pretty much.

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:20.300
 Those are explained.

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:24.300
 The qualifications of the Inner Tantals.

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:26.300
 Again there is so many teachings.

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:36.300
 For example, Buddha gave teachings from age 35 until age 81 or 82.

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:41.300
 So that means over 45 years, Buddha gave the teachings.

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:45.300
 But last, Buddha gave in the celestial realms.

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:50.300
 That maybe we do, not maybe, we didn't see things.

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:58.300
 Only highly designated, highly enlightened beings ever to receive those teachings.

00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:11.300
 So those old teachings has so many detailed teachings and teachers also qualification for teachers.

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:17.300
 And then the commentaries of the great masters explain also so many details.

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:25.300
 Because that's how the lineage teachings are kept as authentic and fresh exactly as it started.

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:30.300
 From time of the Buddha, until now, lineage teachings.

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:35.300
 Teaching of the greatest kindness teacher of the Buddha is not spoiled.

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:36.300
 Not deluded.

00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:37.300
 Not created.

00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:41.300
 The person that I put in it, deluded as like anointing.

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:51.300
 But she was. All kept so impressed, intact and so nugget and so blessed and so powerful.

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:52.300
 Five.

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:58.300
 Therefore, the qualifications of the teachers explain every of those teachings.

00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:03.300
 Both the Buddha's teachings, scripture and as well as common truths.

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:05.300
 Every way.

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:10.300
 So what I say today, Inner Tantal is some old, I mean just one of those teachings.

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:13.300
 In reality, it encompasses everything.

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:15.300
 It's both nugget or Inner Tantal.

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:19.300
 It also can be applied to the Sutra of Teaching.

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:25.300
 And as well as the Pundit Buddha's teaching.

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:29.300
 And in Mahayana, Sutra of Mahayana Teaching.

00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:33.300
 And all Mahayana Teaching can be applied.

00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:36.300
 So this is what goes up.

00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:40.300
 The qualifications of the teacher.

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:42.300
 And how, okay.

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:46.300
 And then, the great master Chantadeva.

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:51.300
 Chantadeva summarized into very simple one.

00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:54.300
 And he said,

00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:06.300
 The spiritual friends of the Mahayana teachings.

00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:10.300
 Mahayana is one who has expert knowledge.

00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:15.300
 Knowledge of Mahayana teachings.

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:23.300
 And never give up the vows of the bodhisattva, even the cost of life.

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:30.300
 These two, who had understood perfect meaning of the Mahayana teaching.

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:37.300
 And never give up the vows of the bodhisattva, even the cost of life.

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:44.300
 That is the two simple part, true qualification of the masters.

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:50.300
 So that means, expert of the Mahayana teaching has highlighted that.

00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:55.300
 But same time, expert of all the teachings of the great Master Chantadeva,

00:23:55.300 --> 00:24:00.300
 that have some knowledge, some understanding.

00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:05.300
 And then, have the vows, giving up all the vows.

00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:10.300
 That means bodhisattva vows, what vows the bodhisattvas.

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:14.300
 As I mentioned other day, of course, we all know.

00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:16.300
 We all know that.

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:20.300
 Those are known as the...

00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:30.300
 The vows that will stop appropriating all the naked witness.

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:34.300
 There is three vows of the bodhisattva, samarayas.

00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:39.300
 Vows that will stop all the naked witness.

00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:46.300
 One. Second is, vows that will gather all the virtues,

00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:50.300
 all the dharma, all the virtues.

00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:56.300
 Vows that will perform all beneficial activities.

00:24:56.300 --> 00:25:01.300
 Those are the three vows of the principal one.

00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:05.300
 All vows of the wishing bodhisattva.

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:11.300
 Vows of the actualizing bodhisattva.

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:14.300
 Keeping up that.

00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:17.300
 So that is simplified that.

00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:20.300
 That means, it is also all best of the right.

00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:24.300
 Best of the bodhisattva.

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:27.300
 Never giving up the loving kindness.

00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:29.300
 Never giving up the compassion.

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:35.300
 Never giving up the wisdom of the wisdom, combined that.

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:39.300
 And then when you have that, when you keep the love,

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:42.300
 when you keep the compassion, how that teacher will be,

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:46.300
 or how that spiritual friend will be.

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:52.300
 More calm, more peaceful, more loving,

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:56.300
 more caring, more concerning.

00:25:56.300 --> 00:26:01.300
 And gentle, daunted earth, not evil-boosting,

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:04.300
 not creating any personal creation, these and that things,

00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:07.300
 kind of performing all different things.

00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:12.300
 Really daunted earth, mingling with every individualist.

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:17.300
 But yet, keeping those all beautiful qualities

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:21.300
 and the benefit of all the sentiments with polite kindness,

00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:27.300
 compassion, respect, that is what these masters are,

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:31.300
 what this spiritual friend gave him.

00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:33.300
 That's what the teaching said.

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:36.300
 Kalyan matra, I think it's asked.

00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:38.300
 That is what it is.

00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:41.300
 So those are known as, when you have those,

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:43.300
 those are called applicatic teachings.

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:46.300
 Generating the teaching said, this for example,

00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:50.300
 ordinary teacher, I divide it into three.

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:57.300
 Ordinary or social give him an ordinary spiritual friend.

00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:02.300
 And the Bodhisattva teacher and the Buddha, those three.

00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:07.300
 Ordinary teacher is not completely free from all the errors and mistakes.

00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:09.300
 Ordinary teacher is not completely,

00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:13.300
 every all the good qualities are completed, actually like that.

00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:17.300
 Ordinary teacher means not, he is a hunger man.

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:20.300
 He is still woke up on enlightenment.

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:24.300
 He can have all the different mistakes and errors,

00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:26.300
 still he is an obscure being.

00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:33.300
 But yet, he can help us, inspire us and support us to action.

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:40.300
 We will not have the capability to see the enlightened beings as teacher now.

00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:46.300
 So for our capabilities, it's been practical.

00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:51.300
 And we like to have the perfect teacher as the Buddha or the enlightened beings.

00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:55.300
 We have to wait for a long time.

00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:58.300
 Maybe we never going to get unless practice.

00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:00.300
 What did the teaching say?

00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:09.300
 The Sambokaya teachers only can see those 10th or the Ed Bumi Bodhisattvas.

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:15.300
 Many everyday people, such as us, like us, us, or me, or like us,

00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:22.300
 we not yet on the relief in the enlightened, the realization, big realization.

00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:25.300
 How we can see Buddha immediately?

00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:29.300
 How we can see the Sambokaya teacher?

00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:31.300
 How we can see Mejushi?

00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:34.300
 How we can see the Garpayama Sambokaya immediately?

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:41.300
 We don't have any capabilities.

00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:43.300
 So we have to do.

00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:46.300
 Now what we have to do? We have to do practical.

00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:50.300
 More with the common sense, according to our capabilities,

00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:54.300
 let's build up, build up the realization.

00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:56.300
 Then we can elevate it.

00:28:56.300 --> 00:29:00.300
 And the teaching says, when you got high realization,

00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:04.300
 those high realization beings will be easy.

00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:08.300
 You will be easy in those high realization beings.

00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:12.300
 Again, and those are great masters we read in life stories.

00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:15.300
 They received teachings from the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas,

00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:18.300
 this is one after another, all that thing.

00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:24.300
 Because their high realization can help communication and help their capabilities.

00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:29.300
 For four hours, we just have to follow what we can do.

00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:34.300
 That is more safer, more practical, and more nicer.

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:36.300
 And that's how we can develop.

00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:42.300
 So feed contact with the teacher and then receive the teachings.

00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:44.300
 And following the path.

00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:48.300
 That is known as then we begin to process,

00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:51.300
 changing the over-process of the,

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:55.300
 and turning the path, and turning the one.

00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:58.300
 And among that, first one is, then when we do,

00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:01.300
 is then take raffles.

00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:06.300
 Raffles. With that, raffles is the foundation

00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:10.300
 of the entirely path truth.

00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:14.300
 Or raffles is the ground of the path truth.

00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:18.300
 From there, we reach the, then from there,

00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:26.300
 we will go to the ground, or the path to the enlightenment.

00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:29.300
 And that's it. Then we can, from that,

00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:34.300
 we begin to change our karmas.

00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:41.300
 From that, we begin to change the direction of samsara.

00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:43.300
 That's called the teaching.

00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:45.300
 That is what I will teach.

00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:47.300
 And that is my great talk for today.

00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:50.300
 And thank you so much everyone again for participating.

00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:51.300
 Thank you.

00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:53.300
 Thank you very much everyone.

00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:55.300
 Again, thank you.

00:30:57.300 --> 00:30:59.300
 Thank you.

00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:07.300
 Again, we do short meditation as we do.

00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:29.300
 Thank you.

00:31:57.300 --> 00:31:59.300
 Thank you.

00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:28.300
 Thank you.

00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:59.300
 Thank you.

00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:29.300
 Thank you.

00:33:57.300 --> 00:33:59.300
 Thank you.

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:29.300
 Thank you.
