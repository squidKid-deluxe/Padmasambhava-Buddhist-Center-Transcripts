00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.440
 And again, as we begin our practice and kind of study, reflection, and our practice for

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:18.640
 today, as well as with anything, again and again, just reconnecting with our three essential

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:32.720
 motivations with our joy, our appreciation, really expand our Bodhichitta, and connect

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:49.080
 with our devotion and awe and reverence for just how perfect this moment is.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:21.160
 So again, welcome. We'll spend maybe 15-20 minutes just kind of reflecting again on some

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:30.560
 of the really essential practices and things that our great, precious teachers have given

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:40.240
 us as tips and tools to explore the Dharma and develop that and integrate that again

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:47.960
 in the context of our Ngondro, these really essential points that we're just encouraged

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:56.720
 again and again and again to keep in our mind. Again, the whole of Dharma, like we often say,

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:04.480
 can be summed up into these essential points of Dharma practice, the Dharma path, and what

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:15.980
 is Dharma, but the totally related with discovering the beautiful qualities and nature and

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:16.800
 qualities

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:24.320
 and abilities and power of what? Of our own essential nature, of our own mind, of our

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:32.120
 own true, everlasting, ever-present Bodhichitta and wisdom and power through the great support

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:40.240
 of those who have fully developed it and are well on the way with our teachers, the Buddhas,

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:54.120
 the Bodhisattvas. Refraining from harm, engaging in benefit, taming our own mind. That's again,

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:01.680
 we say so often, is the distillation of that. That's the Dharma. That's the essence of the

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:09.640
 Buddhist teachings as far as the path. So working with our own mind is the essence of

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:17.680
 Dharma practice, really connecting with our joy, our devotion, our Bodhichitta, our trust,

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:25.200
 which means we've done some exploration and we've summed up both intellectually as well

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:31.880
 as experientially in the teachings. And so what I thought to kind of just really, I know

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:37.040
 we mention it often and I don't know how much just in these sessions we've really spent

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:46.040
 time to look at some of these fundamental aspects of just even like these four thoughts

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:53.200
 that turn the mind toward the Dharma, which are nothing other again than just looking

00:03:53.200 --> 00:04:03.020
 at on a really common level what we all share, what we all have, what we're all endowed with.

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:08.040
 So I was going to really, I am going to focus a little bit more today within the time we

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:20.400
 have to just kind of review these, the freedoms and endowments of which there are eight freedoms,

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:27.760
 eight freedom states, eight states we're totally free of and that allow us to be able to practice

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:33.400
 Dharma, to be able to explore our own nature and bring out its beautiful qualities for

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:42.880
 ourselves and others. And then so ten states we're free of that would prevent us from practicing

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:53.320
 Dharma, from exploring our true nature and then ten circumstances, ten advantages, ten

00:04:53.320 --> 00:05:01.080
 endowments, ten conditions that we have that are actually totally in alignment with discovering

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:09.240
 our true nature. So I know we've gone over them but again even myself, can I remember

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:15.480
 what they are? You know the teachings again like the Buddha describes so often or Shanti

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:23.880
 Deva, we're born with this precious human body, this that's like a great vessel to bring

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:30.480
 ourselves and others across the ocean of samsara, you know so it's so important you know we

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:37.960
 don't waste it in vain, we're like or like the Buddha uses the analogy of like a blind

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:47.680
 you know totally destitute beggar coming upon a precious jewel and never using it or having

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:56.840
 a treasure and never using it, you know having the means to escape from prison and never

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:05.480
 applying it, having an open door and staying in the cage you know. So really being mindful

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:11.480
 again we're just encouraged so often to really be aware of what are these freedoms, what

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:21.000
 are these endowments and then how do we protect them, you know things and not everything lasts

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:31.320
 forever. So maybe we'll just kind of go over the basic thing, the eight freedom states

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:37.360
 that allow us that eight states were free of in which we couldn't practice dharma, do

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:45.360
 you recall what they are? So one thing is to think we can think in order, essentially

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:53.720
 it's we're not born in the hell realms, we're not born in the preda realm, not born in which

00:06:53.720 --> 00:07:03.480
 means the hungry ghost realm, we're not born as animals in any of the animal realms and

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:14.080
 we're not born as a formless God in one of the higher aspects of the God realms. But

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:24.960
 and then even within being born human, we're not born human in some kind of barbaric culture

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:32.800
 you know where there is no dharma, that's what we need by barbarian and here I don't

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:42.440
 even necessarily mean official dharma but just where like violence and you know taking

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:49.600
 advantage where negative emotions are glorified I guess could be maybe a simple way of looking

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:59.240
 at barbarians being born in a place. So we're free of that for the most part. We're also

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:07.240
 free of kind of mistaken views to some degree, meaning again these kind of extreme views

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:17.480
 of like totally glorifying violence, of glorifying you know pushing making our self-importance

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:30.880
 or you know things like that. We're also not born in a universe where a Buddha, a dark

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:40.880
 it's called the dark kalpa, we're not born in a place where the where no Buddha has appeared.

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:49.560
 So where are we now I think that's seven and then we're not born with so such impaired

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:54.960
 senses that we have no contact with the outside world, with the other humans in our world

00:08:54.960 --> 00:09:01.200
 in the dharma. So we're free of those things. So on the very we could look at the deepest

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:08.560
 from the one way of kind of remembering those basically is right there are six realms of

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:17.040
 beings that the Buddha said six major realms that all entail samsara. There's the hells,

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:24.720
 there's the prey, the prey to realm, there's the animal realm, there's the human realm

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:30.680
 and then there's the god realms which are like the asuras and then the gods but we're

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:35.560
 not we're not born in the formless. So we could think kind of the furthest outreaches

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:42.840
 the hells were free of the predators were free of being born there. We're free of being

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:49.840
 born in the animal realm and we're free of being born in one of these higher states of

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:58.400
 the god realms which says the formless gods. So essentially what that means that's a state

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:09.680
 where we're born gods with just in single with no just kind of asleep for aeons. And

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:15.200
 so that's kind of narrowing it down. We are born human and we're free as humans we're

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:25.200
 free from being born in a barbaric land in a barbaric culture. We're free of being you

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:32.200
 know having kind of wrong views or mistaken views kind of distorted views things that

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:36.960
 cause more views that glorify things that bring more trouble actually for ourselves

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:45.520
 and others. We're free of that again in different degrees and we're free of being born where

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:54.440
 there's no Buddha and we're free and we have all of our immediately we have we're able

00:10:54.440 --> 00:11:02.040
 to make contact through our senses with the outside world with the world in which we exist.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:11.400
 So that's in a nutshell the eight freedom states that allow us to practice Dharma. But

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:18.720
 now we could be born with those things and not necessarily have these extra circumstances

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:30.520
 these ten circumstantial states or ten advantages ten endowments for what for actually practicing

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:38.000
 the Dharma for engaging with exploring and the nature of our own mind the nature of our

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:45.800
 own heart bringing out its qualities purifying what's obscuring at and being a benefit for

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:55.040
 others and ourselves realizing true nature and through compassion helping others to realize

00:11:55.040 --> 00:12:03.900
 their own true nature as well. So within these again there's if we want to kind of have frames

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:13.560
 for remembering them there's ten endowments ten advantages and there are five that kind

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:20.460
 of are reef we're checking in with our the outside circumstances in which we're born

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:29.060
 and then there's five that are more connected to our own individual circumstances and proclivities.

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:37.780
 So to go over them again kind of briefly the five we're born actually where a Buddha has

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:45.920
 appeared there's so many aeons and so many world systems in which no Buddha ever appears

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:50.960
 we're born in an aeon on which a Buddha has appeared in fact not just one Buddha will

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:59.800
 appear but according to the omniscient words of truth of the Buddha Shakyamuni you know

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:05.200
 there's not just one but a thousand Buddhas appear in this aeon a very called the fortunate

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:19.280
 aeon right so a Buddha has appeared and not only did the Buddha appear the Buddha taught

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:26.980
 and not only did he teach all those twenty six hundred twenty eight hundred years ago

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:42.060
 but those teachings still remain and they can be understood and there are those that

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:51.700
 have do currently who have through their great kindness and diligence have some knowledge

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:58.520
 and realization of the teachings and with great kindness and bodhicitta share them with

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:05.780
 us so those are kind of the circumstances that we outer circumstances that we are endowed

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:12.940
 with that allow us to practice Dharma and then we have the five that are related to

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:23.100
 our own individual circumstances so within that out those five outer circumstances again

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:31.500
 we are born human and we're born human in a place where the Dharma flourishes where the

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:43.660
 Dharma is present and alive there's living lineage masters and we have our all our faculties

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:52.460
 we have the ability to interface with the outside world and we have you know including

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:59.380
 our mind and our intellect not to mention our senses that you know allow that interface

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:03.820
 we have those intact and we're also if you think about it we're also born where maybe

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:12.900
 in ancient times if you were born blind or deaf you you wouldn't be able to even now

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:20.220
 if you were born with maybe some senses that are impaired there's still ways of connecting

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:29.900
 a beautiful a great so again I won't do dawdle here all of our faculties are intact and then

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:39.580
 we don't have conflicting lifestyles that's the fourth individual circumstance and we have

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:50.660
 faith in the teachings so those are the five kind of inner circumstances we have and again

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:56.340
 the teachers again and again they say we should really remember what these things are and

00:15:56.340 --> 00:16:03.980
 contemplate them like you can look in like words of my perfect teacher such a great book

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:09.500
 to have and to study it goes into great detail on these kind of subjects and then there's

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:15.900
 also this guide to the words of my perfect teacher that Kim Po Na Wong, Palsang, great

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:21.700
 emanation of Ima Lamitra goes again into great detail and then of course there's these are

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:27.060
 so fundamental they're in so many teachings of Jigmi Lingpa from our venerable teachers

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:33.380
 Kenshin Palden, Kim Po Se Wong, Jojum Rinpoche and the torch lighting the way to freedom

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:39.340
 goes over these freedoms and advantages and then even to some degree like Dilgo Kenshin

00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:45.620
 Rinpoche and many teachings I mean Shantideva goes on and on so there's other places to

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:52.460
 explore that are easy to like look at these things more so we're born with these things

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:59.320
 but again they're not always gonna last in something that Kim Po Se Wong Rinpoche whenever

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:04.040
 he goes over these things he kind of mentions we should if we remember what these things

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:11.780
 are and then we check in for ourselves kind of where we're at I mean we could be familiar

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:18.540
 with what what are all like the things we're free of what are those circumstances like

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:22.180
 and that's what I was referring to and we can look in these books and in the sutras

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:28.380
 and things and really look at well what is it what is some of a glimpse of what it's

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:37.700
 like to be born in the hell realms for example anyway but then particularly with these circumstant

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:38.000
ial

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:46.700
 endowments really looking at those reflecting on the truth of those and then particularly

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:52.300
 with our individual endowments like Kim Po Se Wong mentions often he doesn't kind of go

00:17:52.300 --> 00:18:04.060
 into detail so much right then but right what are the last two without a conflicting lifestyle

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:10.180
 and having faith in the in the teachings those things can waver they can wax and wane with

00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:19.700
 all of us so like looking to see is good and now there's some other things that also come

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:26.660
 up in the teachings that are equally important to kind of be aware of like I think in I forget

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:36.220
 which teachings but one of our great masters teachers kind of likens like these 18 freedoms

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:44.460
 and endowments are like a flock of sheep that we have in our care and then there's these

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:54.940
 other things which are called they're kind of 16 wolves that can be sneaking in and picking

00:18:54.940 --> 00:19:06.060
 off the flock so these are eight called the eight intrusive circumstances and then I think

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:16.100
 eight proclivities eight incompatible yeah proclivities are kind of like habitual patterns

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:22.060
 we can get sucked into easily that lead no lead lead to kind of no time for practicing

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:28.400
 now and therefore maybe due to karma we're starting to move in a different direction

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:35.760
 with the great fortune we've had and so again there's a lot of detail to these things but

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:41.800
 I think it you know maybe I'll go for the sake of kind of having some detail to thing

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:45.900
 I'll go over them now and again everyone should know definitely and like words of my perfect

00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:52.100
 teacher these other books I mentioned you can really look at the details of what these

00:19:52.100 --> 00:20:00.540
 great masters kind of have elucidated in more detail more time than we have this afternoon

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:13.740
 to go into so these eight intrusive circumstances that leave no freedom to practice Dharma so

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:22.140
 one is essentially and these are related to like these last two our faith and our confidence

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:31.220
 in the Dharma and our ability you know kind of to and how much we're leading other right

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:38.180
 conduct a right lifestyle that is like conducive to practice Dharma practice meaning it's it's

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:45.580
 creating good karma for the future generating merit so and I'm gonna read these things but

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:54.400
 similarly we shouldn't use these as big downers so much of the path is purifying so we shouldn't

00:20:54.400 --> 00:21:02.380
 shy away from when we hit these raw spots of of recognizing our own distorted views

00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:09.260
 that we're holding our own distorted kind of negative propensities that actually cause

00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:17.660
 more trouble more turmoil more kind of are actually holding us back and undermining our

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:23.980
 practice we're all here due to so many good circumstances so when we realize these things

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:31.620
 again these are opportunities to purify to apply the antidotes to ask our you know pray

00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:38.140
 to our teachers for their support and make our aspirations to be aware of what we can

00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:45.700
 purify and let go of in order to bring out and bring our bigger bodhicitta and truly

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:53.340
 be a benefit for others and ourselves okay so essentially these five intrusive things

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:58.740
 that can come into our lives that kind of cause more static and we can get caught up

00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:04.940
 in and we're not practicing as much as we could and therefore maybe that's creating

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:15.860
 karma for maybe the Dharma just fading away from our experience so when the five poisons

00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:25.980
 when our negative emotions our anger our jealousy you know our attachments our arrogance our

00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:36.420
 doubt our hesitation when we're so overwhelmed by those coming up in ourselves that we don't

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:41.300
 we're just kind of distracted and discouraged and pull back from Dharma practice we forget

00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:49.900
 it we forget the instructions we forget our bodhicitta you know so many things so you

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:54.900
 know these are just things to be to like be aware of right we want to keep our mindfulness

00:22:54.900 --> 00:23:01.660
 our alertness our conscientiousness to what we hold dear and keep open and aware to like

00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:09.340
 seeing oh what are these things you know so and then if simply we're just so stupid this

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:15.540
 is the second one being so stupid that you know we're actually not for whatever reason

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:24.500
 we're not able to really hear the the teachings understand the meaning or the words and essentially

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:33.380
 we're easily led astray if we can't really get some bearings and that's simply you know

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:40.700
 do do again all this is due to our past actions so what we can can we do then we can pray

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:46.860
 you know to our teacher pray to Guru Rinpoche pray to our root teacher and all the Buddhas

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:54.180
 and bodhisattvas that we purify our obscurations that our wisdom can increase you know do some

00:23:54.180 --> 00:24:05.460
 Manjushri practice or something and then taking on like a false guide a bad taking on bad

00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:12.780
 spiritual friends that kind of lead us in the wrong directions those are also circumstances

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:19.060
 we can engage with that aren't heading we're not heading in a good direction I'm sorry

00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:23.600
 again this is a lot so maybe I'm going to go over some maybe in the future we can look

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:31.380
 more into these or as I'm going if you have questions then ask questions and we can have

00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:40.540
 some kind of dialogue with this process of there are our Saturday meetings then other

00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:47.420
 things are again this is more related to ourselves just being lazy we've heard the teachings

00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:55.460
 but we're lazy either we don't have enough you know confidence in ourselves that we could

00:24:55.460 --> 00:25:01.700
 actually improve or we're just too caught up in other things they have more priority

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:14.180
 and we just don't practice lazy and then the six being when we're discouraged by bad karma

00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:22.620
 ripening and you know which again that's an opportunity for purification but instead of

00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:31.580
 taking it as that when we challenging circumstances come up and we just like gets are so caught

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:38.700
 up in the challenge of it and the suffering of it that we become discouraged and we pull

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:48.940
 back from our practice and then the seventh when we're in a situation where we don't have

00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:54.900
 any autonomy due to whatever the circumstances are where we're we have some commitment or

00:25:54.900 --> 00:26:00.700
 we're overpowered by some other person or persons in which we don't really have a choice

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:09.740
 as to what we're doing and so there may be that means we don't have we can't practice

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:20.260
 to some degree or a big degree or fully and then there's sometimes just again as far as

00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:27.300
 Dharma practice where these are more connected to like attachment to this life where we might

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:34.420
 be connecting to the Dharma just really more out of fear fear of challenging situations

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:40.100
 fear of sickness fear of poverty fear of you know things that are worth being concerned

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:47.140
 about but kind of more involved with this life and without a bigger view of karma without

00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:57.980
 really bodhicitta that's missing kind of the bigger vision of beyond this life and beyond

00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:07.180
 samsara so kind of when we're just kind of acting within those kind of more out of where

00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:16.260
 our fear ratio is much bigger than the ratio of our view of a bigger view beyond this life

00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:24.700
 beyond samsara then it's kind of again kind of we're not really don't have a real view

00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:32.700
 of just how vast and how true and how immediate the Dharma is how the teachings are and then

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:39.420
 kind of another aspect of that the the eighth intrusive circumstances is kind of more related

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:57.980
 to kind of using the Dharma more to how do we say where we're kind of imposters

00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:03.900
 where we're connecting with the Dharma more you're not so much out of fear but out of

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:15.220
 wanting more prestige or wanting more you know wanting more wealth or wanting more food

00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:20.580
 you know to gain possessions or have people take care of you or you know things like that

00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:25.580
 again it's more connected to this life and it's not so much again this is the attitude

00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:33.540
 we can only look to our own minds and see right how much we're looking for you know

00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:39.220
 essentially right these are the eight worldly concerns when our Dharma our connection to

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:44.980
 Dharma is more caught up in the eight worldly concerns hope and fear and more within this

00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:58.100
 life you know all right so then these other propensities that kind of leave not a lot of

00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:05.420
 time and freedom to protect actually practice the Dharma again are when we're so tightly

00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:15.140
 bound to our other commitments in this life in this world that we don't make time to practice

00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:22.300
 Dharma again that always varies person to person how much time we have but when our

00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:31.740
 commitments are out so much that it's causing less time to practice formally or informally

00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:40.940
 and then if we're kind of so ensnared by our negative habitual patterns that we don't try

00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:50.460
 to improve our behavior we might know better but we don't these are all you know also and

00:29:50.460 --> 00:30:02.480
 then when we're not really we can hear about all these teachings about what other beings

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:09.340
 go through in the hell realms or the praetor realms the animal realms the god realms all

00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:14.860
 the the defects of samsara essentially as well as the challenges we face in this life

00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:23.300
 but we just kind of stay numb to it and don't have any kind of for whatever reasons we don't

00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:39.460
 have our determination or or wish to actually free ourselves not to mention others and now

00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:46.620
 and then another big really big these are kind of getting more severe as we go and away no

00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:57.420
 real trust in the teachings or in our teacher where we have very little devotion and trust

00:30:57.420 --> 00:31:05.220
 in the Dharma or in the teachers again that's a whole process right of actually exploring

00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:11.340
 the qualities of a good teacher but really looking at you know where for each one of

00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:19.460
 us is that place where that trust is lacking and then again I'm not talking about that

00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:24.820
 we have to have blind faith but like true trust due to experience and knowledge and

00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:34.900
 feeling seeing truth truth enough to move beyond kind of what we know into discovering

00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:41.860
 right our primordial nature our bodhicitta so no devotion or faith in the Dharma or the

00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:48.580
 teachers is again really negative kind of propensity and these are all based on habitual

00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:57.660
 patterns so everything's mutable everything's fluid right then when we take pleasure in

00:31:57.660 --> 00:32:10.220
 harmful thoughts and harmful actions of ourselves and others and the sixth which is again something

00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:16.420
 really interesting compilate really negative propensity for practicing Dharma is just simply

00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:27.580
 really not being interested seven these are in regard to like the promises we've made

00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:33.780
 to ourselves and to the lungs of the lineage before all the Buddhas and bodhisattvas when

00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:40.700
 we've entered the you know basic Buddhism the vows we've taken and into Mahayana the

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:46.740
 bodhicitta vows and commitments we've taken when we actually break our bodhicitta vows

00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:51.860
 and commitments and kind of hold back and get caught up in things that move against

00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:59.580
 them yes really when we're just we're undermining our practice we're dragging a lot of junk

00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:09.100
 around and then not only with that but then having entered the Vajrayana and with the

00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:18.540
 Samayas and commitments we've made to ourselves and to our teacher and with in witness of

00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:28.820
 all objects of refuge when we have broken these and don't acknowledge it and don't purify

00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:36.060
 it it's really bad news for ourselves and for our friends and Sangha family and all

00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:45.540
 beings so again this is just things to like keep watch over don't shy away from seeing

00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:49.800
 these negative things that's why we do our Vajrasattva practice that's why we make our

00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:58.900
 aspiration prayers that's why we train ourselves in bodhicitta so much of our practice is actually

00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:09.040
 having this joy devotion confidence and really activating our bodhicitta to purify what's

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:14.620
 holding us back because that's again the only difference is how thick our obscurations are

00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:23.620
 our Buddha nature and the teachings is always there our bodhicitta is vast love vast wisdom

00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:30.620
 vast compassion is just covered up due to causes and conditions and so are all these

00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:37.780
 good wonderful freedoms and advantages we have that's also due to such beautiful circumstances

00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:45.900
 so again we're just by looking at these things we're not ignoring we're acknowledging what's

00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:52.060
 good and beautiful and that can bring out you know soften our minds and hearts and then

00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:59.420
 seeing what ways in which we're mixed up you know or have made mistakes and seeing a mistake

00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:06.820
 as a mistake is the first step to purification because we're we're already pure right in

00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:14.380
 the teachings but we have to make these moves to actually purify really apply bring stability

00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:21.350
 to this great beautiful view we're being introduced to bring out our bodhicitta activate our bodhic

00:35:21.350 --> 00:35:21.620
itta

00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:30.460
 means turning our ego clinging upside down you know so again then all all this is coming

00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:38.900
 back to our own mind and we're so fortunate that we have this precious human birth to

00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:55.180
 explore our own mind to tame our own mind using this boat of precious human body to

00:35:55.180 --> 00:36:02.460
 care ourselves and others across the ocean of samsara so that means tending for the to

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:10.940
 the boat acknowledging the boat glorifying the boat you know repairing the boat keeping

00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:19.500
 it good really use this vessel to really benefit ourselves and others so again the teachers

00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:24.300
 say again and again this is just the first thought that turns the mind right what are

00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:34.820
 the eight freedoms what are the ten advantages what are these 16 kind of intrusive and kind

00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:47.740
 of attitudes that we can get snaggled up in and can really lead us away from the advantages

00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:57.500
 and so apply the antidotes with them refrain from harm engage and benefit tame our own

00:36:57.500 --> 00:37:03.260
 mind you know these three great assistants whether in our formal practice or our informal

00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:14.620
 practice really keeping our mindfulness our alertness our conscientiousness it's checking

00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:26.660
 in gently but fully with how much we're really connecting and again that's why Rinpoche always

00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:36.380
 again and again our joy our devotion our closeness feeling for the Dharma is so important and

00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:43.100
 then within that view within that warmth within that nurturing we can look at these other

00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:51.220
 things that we can be getting mixed up in you know either due to our own ability outer

00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:57.180
 circumstances that can cause more trouble where we can get easily led more astray and start

00:37:57.180 --> 00:38:03.420
 going down the wrong path and creating more negative karma as well as our inner attitudes

00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:08.740
 which are even more important to to be aware of and deal with because it's again our inner

00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:18.780
 attitude that makes all the difference and as we generate merit and wisdom then we become

00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:31.820
 stronger and that's the path of awakening so and we the teachings say our teachers say

00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:40.440
 and it's true we have this beautiful connection and it's not accidental or coincidental or

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:49.900
 co-accidental as Rinpoche says it's the result of really good past actions and circumstances

00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:56.860
 whether it's just hearing the name of a Buddha coming in contact with the bodhisattva to

00:38:56.860 --> 00:39:04.700
 whatever degree we've developed our merit and wisdom and we're we're moving on the path

00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:15.500
 we're on this path of awakening and unfolding and purification so we don't know what comes

00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:22.420
 next but we do know it's totally dependent on our attitude now and the actions we take

00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:28.220
 so that's why looking at these freedoms and endowments that really all the qualities of

00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:34.980
 this precious human birth and I just went over today kind of these eight freedoms ten

00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:43.660
 endowments these 16 kind of wolves to watch out for the kind of things that can really

00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:51.340
 undermine our practice and but again there's other aspects to the precious human birth

00:39:51.340 --> 00:40:00.180
 like comparisons of how rare it is how really rare it is for example so we won't go over

00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:06.300
 that now I'm going to stop talking and I hope this is somewhat helpful again it's kind of

00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:13.180
 a each part of these teachings are so vast but I think just trying to use these sessions

00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:19.100
 we have to just kind of reflect on some of these basics and you know like I mentioned

00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:24.540
 there's so many great teachings for even like I thought to really bring up there's so many

00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:29.280
 of these YouTube things that have been recorded on YouTube as well as so many wonderful books

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:37.580
 published from our teachers Kim Kinchen, Paul Dinschera and Venerable Kim Po Se Wong, Dong

00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:42.900
 Yeon, as well as so many YouTube teachings and back at the beginning of the pandemic

00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:50.620
 in 2020, Kim Po Se Wong Rinpoche so kindly went over these teachings from Jojo Rinpoche

00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:55.580
 and he really went into quite a lot of detail on some of these real essential teachings

00:40:55.580 --> 00:41:04.180
 so that's another wonderful resource for kind of listening to and contemplating and really

00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:18.220
 enduring into our hearts and minds and settling into our practice so thank you yes in like

00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:27.220
 words of my perfect teacher of calling it wolves and sheep yeah I mean that's in all

00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:33.220
 of these I mean in words of my perfect teacher it's definitely in the section where it's

00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:38.380
 going over again but the four thoughts that turn the mind so in the section on the precious

00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:45.580
 human birth in words of my perfect teacher it's there in this guide to the words of my

00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:52.460
 perfect teacher again in that same section on the precious human birth in torch lighting

00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:58.180
 the way to freedom on the section where Jojo Rinpoche is going over precious human birth

00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:04.340
 in the four thoughts that turn the mind he goes over all these all these sixteen as well

00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:09.820
 as well as the eight freedoms endowments and then too I just have this nice book in this

00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:17.620
 commentary about Dilgo Kenser Rinpoche this which is a commentary on the 37 practices

00:42:17.620 --> 00:42:24.980
 of a bodhisattva he goes over I think in the chapter about using how the bodhisattva practice

00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:33.900
 of study contemplation meditation he goes over Dilgo Kenser Rinpoche goes over that eight

00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:41.380
 freedoms ten endowments and the sixteen intrusive circumstances and propensities and there's

00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:49.340
 so many other books jigmi lingpas what is it the what is the jigmi lingpa that goes

00:42:49.340 --> 00:43:00.680
 over the foundation the path treasury of I'm sorry I'm losing my there's a lot out there

00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:04.740
 about all these things but these are some great just to start there there's nothing

00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:13.140
 missing there's just more great kind of elucidations from these other great really knowledgeable

00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:21.160
 and highly realized lineage masters that are available to us so thank you so we'll do our

00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:30.140
 practice now we have about 45 minutes so we'll have a session for our Monroe practice that

00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:37.420
 kind of is held within 45 to 50 minutes so just know that I thought as we do our these

00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:42.540
 sessions we're kind of working with the time we have which we're all doing in our daily

00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:49.860
 practice too so if you have more time in your day just because we do a 45-minute nundra

00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:55.420
 practice or half-hour nundra practice on these Saturdays if you have more time then of course

00:43:55.420 --> 00:44:02.580
 do that there's flexibility but what we want to do for our own individual practice is have

00:44:02.580 --> 00:44:10.220
 our goals be attainable so the expectations and the promises we make to ourselves and

00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:16.780
 to our teachers should really be within what our current capacities are so if you have

00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:22.460
 less time do the full practice but less time if you have more time do the full practice

00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:27.780
 with more time but as a continuum try to do what you know you can always do no matter

00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:34.200
 what whether you feel great whether you feel really bad whether great things are happening

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:38.740
 whether awful things are happening whether you're sick you know whether you've got a

00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:44.740
 totally busy schedule what can you know you can always commit to doing and then if you

00:44:44.740 --> 00:44:54.820
 can do more great do that and in each case dedicate the merit keep the essence of bodhicitta

00:44:54.820 --> 00:45:05.620
 joy devotion trust closeness feeling reverence bodhicitta bodhicitta bodhicitta okay
