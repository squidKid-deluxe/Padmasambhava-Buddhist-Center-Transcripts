00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.380
 Welcome, friends. Welcome, everybody. So thank you so much for joining us. This is the fourth

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:21.640
 session of us practicing the Dudjom TersaR Ngondro from Padmasamyaling at the request

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:29.080
 of Venerable Kempo Saewandong, our precious teacher. So real quick, I'll just quickly recap

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:35.080
 a little bit about what we've gone over so far. Lama Laia, I think, has gone through

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:41.660
 in the previous sessions, specifically a little bit about, at least a little bit, about the

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.480
 three noble ones of a noble beginning, noble middle, and noble ending or conclusion to

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.800
 each of our practice sessions, so how to have a complete practice session of nundro, beginning

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.840
 with the motivation, the noble motivation, continuing that motivation with our practice,

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.680
 and then concluding it, dedicating the merit. So I'm very quickly just hitting some points,

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.800
 so we're all kind of on the same page here of what we've covered a little bit so far.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.480
 I think Lama Laia went quickly over Shama to practice of calm-abiding meditation and

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:18.280
 vipassana insight meditation, basically kind of setting the ground for us diving deeper

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.240
 into what those two practices are as we keep moving in our practice, how that changes in

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:31.760
 our experience, so he set that stage, and then also about body posture for formal meditation

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:37.520
 practice sessions, and then in addition to the breath purification practice for basically

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.760
 dispelling or clearing away or kind of just dropping all the tensions we have that we're

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:48.220
 kind of stuck in temporarily and just relaxing and really settling and reconnecting with

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.400
 the vitality of our body and our mind in the moment so our practice session can be very

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:59.800
 uplifted and refreshed. So that's some of the train we've covered, right? Okay, some

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:05.120
 of it. So then today what I'm going to do is really take a step back and do a bird's

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:11.520
 eye view of kind of to orient this dujram tersar practice, which is such a profound

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.800
 teaching that is said to encompass all the teachings of the Buddha, the 84,000 teachings

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.440
 of the Buddha, all the practices, all the philosophical views in a condensed, essential

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:28.800
 teaching we can practice everything at once in a single meditation session and then achieve

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.800
 enlightenment within a single lifetime. This practice would do all of it. So this is a

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.960
 gigantic topic and I think sometimes for me personally taking a step back and especially

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:46.840
 at the beginning seeing how am I framing this practice because in order to do all that it

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:53.040
 seems like I have to do it in a very specific way according to the lineage instructions.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.580
 And so the way I'm going to approach this here is I think a lot of people know over

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.760
 the years and definitely certainly people here know I'm kind of a little bit obsessed

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:16.720
 with the view, view, view, view, view. Philosophical view, world view, mindset, context, our

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.640
 approach

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:25.200
 to how do we approach the dharma. What's our view? How do we come to the dharma? So there

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:32.700
 are all these teachings on the view, our world view we could say in one way our story. So

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:39.040
 I'm going to talk about it a little bit today like what's the story that we always carry

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:46.040
 with us? So the tricky point of us, of me as a sentient being is I always hold this

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:54.080
 story line. And if you're a sentient being, probably you hold the story line too. And

00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:01.960
 the main character of the story, which I say is the story, but it's really my story, is

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:10.360
 me. I'm the main character. And you're the main character of your story. And if we're

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:17.920
 a sentient being, we all assume that. I'm the center of the story. So that's a little

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.400
 difficult because there's a lot of people with a lot of stories happening that enter

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:29.160
 in and exit our story, right? So story is just another word for view. How do I make

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.240
 sense of this experience now? What's the purpose? What am I trying to get out of it? What's

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:41.920
 my attitude? How do I approach it? How do I see myself in this practice? In this moment?

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:50.360
 In my life? What's my story? I mean, am I the hero of my story? Am I the hero that gets

00:04:50.360 --> 00:05:01.040
 challenged and becomes a villain? Am I a villain? Am I an anti-hero? Am I a bumbling just normal

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:08.360
 person? Am I going to save the day in the end? Is it a dystopian narrative? Is everything

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:16.400
 burning? Is it a utopian narrative? This is all wonderful. So the Buddha taught all these

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:26.720
 stories. They're called provisional teachings. And each Jhana or vehicle has its own story,

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.640
 and that story has its own rhythms, and its own rules, and its own language, and its own

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:37.000
 way of seeing ourself. Like, how do I tell the story to myself when I go from a basic

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:44.800
 Buddhism, foundational Buddhism view? What's the story? And then a Sutra Mahayana view,

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:50.560
 how does the story change? Is it different? What's the view? How does it expand? And similarly

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:56.160
 then with a Tantra Mahayana view, how does that story or that view expand? What's my

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:03.240
 role in it? What's your role in it? What's all of our roles in this story? Because the

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:09.480
 fundamental thing is, we don't get to decide if we're going to tell a story or not. Every

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:14.480
 single one of us walks around with this grand narrative about what life is about and who

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:19.600
 I am and what I'm going to do and how the day is going to be and what I'm going to try

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:24.820
 to get done. Like, that's all of you. And every single moment of our experience, we

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:33.880
 hold a view. We hold a mindset, a worldview, a story, a tawa. And this Dejum Tersar Nundro,

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:40.120
 it really assumes a very specific view in order for it to be practiced according to

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:45.760
 the lineage instructions. And so it's really worth the time to get clear about, well, what

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:54.440
 is that view of this Dejum Tersar Nundro? What's the story? So in Buddhism, there's always

00:06:54.440 --> 00:07:01.960
 two basic storylines. There's the conceptual one, which centers around characters doing

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:08.360
 things and overcoming and achieving, failing and learning. And then there's the non-conceptual

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:15.860
 one, which basically says, I'm not going to get obsessed with this story. I'm just going

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:23.640
 to relax and let things unfold. So that's more of an absolute truth or non-conceptual.

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:30.160
 So there's a non-conceptual view. And then there's a conceptual view or a conceptual story.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:39.600
 Right? I'm trying to kind of reframe this in a way that's a little different than how

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:44.040
 we usually hear this, because part of the difficulty of so-called seasoned practitioners

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:48.160
 of when we've been around the Dharma for a long time, we can kind of have a checklist

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:54.800
 of all the things we've done and basically feel like, I'm great in this way. I did this.

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:59.240
 I accumulated that. I have this. I've sat through this much. Now I can sit. I do all

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:07.140
 these sessions and my story becomes very self-affirming and very me-centered and very much non-D

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:07.840
harmic.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:14.680
 Because in the end, the base-level story in Buddhism is not all about me, because everyone

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:21.680
 has a story. And we all want to be happy. That's part of everyone's view, is we're all trying

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:31.360
 every moment to do something to make us happy. Every breath we take, we want to feel happy.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:37.280
 And so the basic Buddhism, foundational Buddhism view or story, this so-called Hinayana or

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:48.580
 Theravada-level view, is in a really specific way, the ship is sinking. So what am I going

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:55.640
 to do? Or we're monkeys playing in a forest and there's a fire circling around us and it's

00:08:55.640 --> 00:09:04.480
 closing towards us, and that's just the situation of life. This is basic Buddhism. We're in

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:10.600
 a house and it's on fire, and what am I going to do? It's called the first noble truths

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:18.560
 of suffering. All conditioned existence involves difficulty and challenge. All of it, every

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:24.120
 single moment of conditioned existence, anything dependently arisen comes together, stays together

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:31.280
 temporarily and disentangles and disintegrates, disintegrates. And if we resist that coming

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:38.000
 together or we resist the coming apart, that's suffering. But it's always moving. It's always

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:44.680
 moving. We can't stop it. We can just utilize it or not. And so this comes to one fundamental

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:54.360
 point about story making in our minds, is do we think the story's fixed? Am I stuck the

00:09:54.360 --> 00:10:00.480
 way I am? Is my story the way it is? Am I always the hero? Am I always the victim? Am

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:07.780
 I always the villain? Am I always the scapegoat? Am I always the sidekick? Do we believe in

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:13.320
 stories like that? I just am this way and there's kind of nothing I can do about it.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:17.760
 And so when life comes and challenges me, which is samsara, because things don't always

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:24.600
 go along our story line, then if I think it's fixed, basically I'm going to try to do anything

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:31.320
 I can to just do my best, but it's just in the end, it's like I did what I could, but

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:43.920
 it's not my fault because I'm just this way. So that's a fixed view of stories. I have

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:51.160
 this view. There's one way this goes, the end. So another type of mindset is called

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:57.160
 a growing mindset. This happened, but I don't have to do the same thing I've done before.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:01.620
 My habits are flexible. I have all this potential. There's a teaching called Buddha Nature and

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:06.040
 I can do this differently this time. I can totally change the direction. Like the Buddha

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:10.560
 taught all these techniques. I'm going to use them now. This opportunity is a challenge.

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:15.800
 I'm going to use it to do something different, to be curious about what broke or what the

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:21.280
 failure was or how I can change and navigate the situation a little more creatively. Try

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:26.520
 something new. Ask for help. Give in and surrender. Like, oh, I'm not really that good at this.

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:31.120
 Okay, so let me take stock and see if I want to put more time in trying to cultivate this

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:40.280
 quality. This is foundational in every Buddhist story. We have to be willing to change. Our

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:47.040
 own capacity has that flexibility. Our habits are not fixed. They are not fundamentally

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:54.680
 structured in any kind of an inherent existence, truly existent way. Buddhism in all levels

00:11:54.680 --> 00:12:00.560
 believes this. It's fundamentally flexible. We can get new bad habits and they can become

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:06.440
 really stuck and we can get new good habits and they can become really resilient. But

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:11.760
 it's flexible. And this is in one way of talking about emptiness. The mind is fundamentally

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:16.520
 flexible. Reality is fundamentally flexible. Experience is fundamentally flexible. The

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:25.480
 story can always change. Our view always has the opportunity to change right now. And that's

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:32.520
 where our power lies right in this minute now. We can change our story or our view. We can

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:39.320
 open it. We can become sensitive, curious, engaged, empowered. Like Buddha gave all these

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:46.120
 techniques of how to basically lift off with more joy and appreciation, courage and commitment,

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:51.040
 connection to other beings, seeing things purely. These are all techniques, skillful

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:58.480
 means to Buddha gave for us to take on a new story intentionally, consciously. So that's

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:02.880
 why in the beginning of all these sessions we supplicate the lineage. We meditate and

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:07.800
 calm our minds. We do a breath purification to release things we're holding onto that

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:12.920
 maybe we don't have to hold onto it. Maybe we just can relax and see what newly arises

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:21.240
 right now. A fresh beginner's mind, right? So we're constantly trying to be in this fresh

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:27.560
 poised, receptive, responsive, sensitive mind. This very growing mindset. This like way of

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:36.480
 being that's really curious and really kind of very powerful. And so this thing with having

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:42.520
 a story line, even if the story line is there is conditioned existence. What can I do about

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:46.440
 it? The Buddha taught there's a path and there is a possibility of actually fundamentally

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:52.200
 forever coming out of suffering. The Buddha taught this path so clearly, the A fold noble

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:57.960
 path and the foundational teachings. It can be done and these masters have done it and

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:02.080
 the Buddha did it and Guru Rinpoche did it and there's this little stainless golden lineage

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:09.280
 of masters that did it and they told us how they did it. And now it's up to us. Like we

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:15.240
 have to pop on our attention. We have to drop our story or we have to make a better story.

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:20.460
 It doesn't just have to be anti-story. We can actually co-create a story given this

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:25.080
 body we have, the things we've been through, the traumas we've experienced, the talents

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:31.720
 we have, the friends around us. Like we can co-create a better story and then fundamentally

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:38.880
 not really be so obsessed with how the story turns out. Because in the end, there's no

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:47.120
 end. Right? Every story line has to come to an end but Buddha said the idea of an end

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:55.000
 is not true. It keeps going. Cause effect, cause effect, cause conditions effect, cause

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:03.120
 conditions effect. There's no end to the story. So if we have a really flexible state of mind,

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:10.160
 that's good news. Cause that means we can keep helping as long as we don't have to make

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:17.720
 it only according to my story. Then we can just keep hurting. That's really samsara.

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:21.640
 It's called ego grasping, self absorption. We've been, we've heard these teachings so

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:28.760
 many times, a narrative only about me all the time is really suffering. So foundational

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:33.800
 Buddhism, the Buddha said, that is our typical story line. It's all about me. And there's

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:40.480
 a way to actually love ourselves enough to drop that story and create a better story

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:47.720
 to have a more expansive, inclusive view. Look for that me that we feel is so fixed

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:54.800
 in this very specific way. It's me and this is my story and my language and my, my, my.

00:15:54.800 --> 00:16:01.680
 Look for that my, look for me, look for that feeling of me, the hero, the villain, the victim,

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:07.400
 the practitioner, the whoever, prove it to me that that me is there. That was the Buddha's

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:16.480
 challenge. Show me that that story is fixed. And if we take up that challenge, we get to

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:24.200
 see that it's not as fixed as we thought. And we also get to see that in some ways,

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:30.840
 we're really fixated in ways we didn't see before. And that can be a hard truth to see.

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:39.240
 I am stuck in this way. I did that. I'm not an angry person. Maybe there's a lot of things

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:44.480
 we have. It's hard to be self honest to be really have a really thorough self inquiry

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:49.520
 where we don't just inquire about our awesome stuff, but we inquire about the places that

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:56.120
 scare us and we're uncertain about and it's kind of iffy and we need help. We have to

00:16:56.120 --> 00:17:02.680
 be vulnerable. So we have this path, the Buddha, the great guide, the noble being Buddha, and

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:06.880
 the Dharma, this guidebook, it's all these instructions on how to make more sense, how

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:11.600
 to have a better story. And the Sangha, these fellow travelers, these companions, everyone's

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:16.600
 our Sangha, the Buddhists, the non Buddhists, the insects, the all sentient beings, the aliens.

00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:21.760
 We're all in this together. This is a totally infinite boat and we're all in it and we can't

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:29.280
 ever leave it. And the boat will never dock. It's just the story doesn't end. And that's

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:36.880
 when this Sutra Mahayana story becomes really big. We all have this fixed story. Oh, but

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:42.040
 what's your story? What makes you curious? What do you like? What are you passionate about?

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:46.480
 What are you really interested in? What really kind of makes you come alive? Because I'm

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:52.760
 interested in that. And all of a sudden there's so many stories to be interested in your view,

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:57.600
 your view, this view, the bugs view, that view, this view. And all of a sudden, instead

00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:01.880
 of just being like this one view is the way, all of a sudden it's like, oh, there's all

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:06.000
 these stories. There's all these users ways, different ways of directing it, producing

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.600
 it, sound editing, all these. It's amazing. This artistic experience of being alive. It's

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:18.000
 so creative. And our heart just reaches out because so many of these stories are really

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.080
 about someone feeling like they're worthless and they're just, and they can't do it. And

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:27.120
 the life is against them and it's over the end. The end is always just going to be a repeat

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:34.960
 of a tragedy. So many stories are like that, you know? So then our heart reaches out like,

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:40.080
 oh, is that really true? Like maybe I can be with you in some way where a little glimmer

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:46.000
 of light comes in. It's not really that. You're not bad like that. You have so much potential.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.120
 There's so much beauty. Like even right now it's so beautiful. And a little bit, the story

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:56.400
 opens. The view opens. The person's self-confidence opens. Our self-confidence and compassion

00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:02.760
 open. And all of a sudden we're creating stories together that are so much more aligned with

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:08.600
 actual facts. The flexibility of the nature instead of the fiction. Which is, this is

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:17.920
 just one set way. There's nothing I can do. I give up. Right? So to wrap up. What is this

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:23.880
 Dujum Tersar story? It takes us and expands the Sutra Mahayana view into Tantra Mahayana

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:32.040
 view. And where does every Tantra Mahayana view begin? No story. The beginning of every

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:38.080
 practice, beginning of Seven Line Prayer. What does this mean in one way? Pop out of

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:44.520
 any story line. See how you are before you assume a narrative. Is there part of your

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:50.680
 awareness that doesn't have to be funneled through concepts? Through a view? That's what

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:55.600
 the great noble master Nagarjuna said. The highest supreme view is the view beyond all

00:19:55.600 --> 00:20:02.880
 views. The view-less view. That's where this practice starts every time. And that's the

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:07.560
 ideal in this book of Illuminating the Path by Venerable Kemba Rinpoche and his Holiness

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:12.480
 Dujum Rinpoche. It gives such clear instructions on these two views. Non-conceptual view and

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:17.840
 conceptual view. And we should really treasure them. This is like really, this is a guidebook.

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:22.600
 This is the only thing we need to get out of Samsara to have a totally abrasive, amazing

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:28.780
 story that will include all stories. That's all we'll ever need. And there's other guidebooks

00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:33.640
 like that that will do the exact same thing. It's such a fortunate time. And that story,

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:37.280
 when we pop out of always having to have center around characters and there's going to be

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:43.680
 a fixed end and we have to overcome, it says disrupt any story line. And so that's this

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:53.640
 Tantra Mahayana view. Just disrupt it. Just pause. Break out of any story making. Then

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:57.080
 there's some spaciousness. There's some openness. There's flexibility. All of a sudden there's

00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:02.280
 a lot of options on the table. And consciously choose what story you want to engage right

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:10.680
 now. And the Tantra Mahayana view story, the view, is this is, there's no problem here.

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:17.440
 It's all a celebration. We're in front of the refuge tree with Gururimache, Dakas, Dakinis,

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:22.160
 Dharmapalas, all the Harukas, the Arhats, all the Bodhisattvas, the entire lineage up

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:28.280
 to Gururimache with all these Dharma books surrounding us throughout space. That's the

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:34.920
 setting of this story. And what am I? I'm this, I have this potential that can be fully

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:40.640
 awakened in this lifetime just like you. And so I want to go for that. Let's go for that.

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:45.640
 Like at least this session, like let's try to go for that. This time, maybe this time

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:52.320
 I can actually do that right now. Pop into a non-story, non-view, post-view, beyond view,

00:21:52.320 --> 00:22:00.460
 however you want to call it. And then create the story of enlightened pure wisdom display.

00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:06.080
 This is Tantra. So this Dhujum Terasar is so profound. This is his only, his Dhujum

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:11.180
 Terasar wrote this extensive commentary on this term of revelation that he received or

00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:17.760
 he kind of revealed from Guru Padmasambhava. And it's really worth our time to keep putting

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:23.600
 the time in. Because the thing is, is these habits or these storylines, they die hard.

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:31.600
 Basically because we've just made the groove really deep. Good habits, bad habits, no habits,

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:38.260
 these deep negative habits, we have to actually not be convinced of those stories anymore.

00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:43.880
 We have to see how they're not true. We actually are fundamentally good. And these positive

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:47.520
 habits like you're fundamentally good, you're fundamentally good, you and you and all of

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:53.680
 us and everyone has this nature of Buddha nature and bodhicitta is the way reality functions.

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:59.280
 Those are positive habits. We have to make really deep storylines because that's the

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:05.280
 more correct story. It's the better story. It's the more true story. And finally, we

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:09.040
 have to get out of the pop out of the bubble of fixating on how this is all

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:16.560
 gonna end and what's the final storyline and who's in the credits. We're all in

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:21.840
 the credits. We all contributed to every everyone. You were the director and you

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:24.480
 were the director and you did this and you did that and you were the hero and

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:28.440
 you were the hero and you're the villain and we all took all these roles for

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:34.000
 infinite time. So now we can really go beyond this kind of story making and

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.760
 just relax for a minute and just let the stories kind of happen and what does it

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:42.600
 make us? It makes us available to actually meet people where their stories

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:47.740
 are, where their view is. We open up some options for ourselves so then we can

00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:53.640
 actually show up in someone else's story and how can I help you in your story? How

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:56.960
 can I match your view? And that's what the Buddha did like a mirror just

00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:00.720
 reflected people's views, their dispositions, their readiness, their

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:05.080
 capability and just with such kindness and such love and compassion and

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:09.320
 intelligence did just a little bit so that story could become a little more

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:14.280
 creative and inclusive and loving towards themselves towards others. And so

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:19.160
 we're fundamentally like have such great fortune to engage this Dhujum Terrasar

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:23.960
 Nandro and to do this together. This is virtual here and it's in person here and

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:29.000
 in one way this is all all it's all virtual this all these stories these

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.120
 invisible and tangible stories we're all weaving together that's just it's always

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:37.560
 how it's been and so we have this great opportunity to do this together to

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:45.360
 really consciously choose this very brilliant very grounded practical

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:53.240
 common sense empowered sophisticated simple way of creating a story together

00:24:53.240 --> 00:25:00.200
 creating a view that's really natural and that's just fundamentally who we are.

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:05.320
 So I thank you for the opportunity to say a few things and then yay lama laya we

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:09.800
 get to kind of follow Kemba Rinpoche and Kenshin Paul and Chair Rinpoche's lead

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:13.580
 and his only student Rinpoche and all the lineage and practice these sacred

00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:17.840
 teachings together so really thank you so much for showing up thank you for

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:25.760
 years of participation and if you're new warm welcome and so here we go thank you.

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:59.400
 Drop who you are in how you thunk. Grace waves radiate from the plunk of stillness

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:08.080
 deep in the lake of the heart of the mother of all sky.

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:19.840

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:49.840
 [Silence]

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:32.260
 We have about an hour for our practice so let's begin with the seven-line

00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:38.560
 prayer and then in the nundra sadhana we'll chant this call in the lama from afar.

00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:51.480
 Which begins on page 18 in this book. Are there different numbers in these nundras?

00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:10.560

 now

00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:00.360
 now

00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:37.360
 [silence]

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:40.360
 The heart and enlightenment.

00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:53.360
 [silence]

00:40:53.360 --> 00:41:05.360
 [singing]

00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:09.360
 From now until the attainment of the heart and enlightenment

00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:13.360
 I take refuge in the Lama, the Three Jewels.

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:16.360
 [silence]

00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:20.360
 From now until the attainment of the heart and enlightenment

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:24.360
 I take refuge in the Lama, the Three Jewels.

00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:28.360
 From now until the attainment of the heart and enlightenment

00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:32.360
 I take refuge in the Lama, the Three Jewels.

00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:36.360
 From now until the attainment of the heart and enlightenment

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:40.360

 From now until the attainment of the heart and enlightenment

00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:48.360
 I take refuge in the Lama, the Three Jewels.

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:57.360
 [silence]

00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:02.360
 Now all the sentient beings before us, our mother and father of this life

00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:10.360
 all like a flock of birds alight and merge into the refuge tree.

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:16.360
 They all dissolve into the form of Guru Padmasambhava.

00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:20.360
 And we merge into the heart of Padmasambhava.

00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:49.360
 [silence]

00:42:49.360 --> 00:43:18.360
 [silence]

00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:41.360
 [silence]

00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:50.360
 I continue with the Generating Bodhicitta, page 30.

00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:56.360
 Beseeching all the objects of refuge embodied as Guru Padmasambhava to bear witness.

00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:59.360
 And then I think we're all familiar with group practice

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:02.360
 but in case anyone's wondering what's going on

00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:10.360
 we'll all chant together with our motivation, with our view, with our intention

00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:15.360
 and we'll do that together and then we'll all go at our own rate

00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:21.360
 and then I'll kind of signal when we're kind of coming to the end of this section

00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:26.360
 and then we'll again drop everything and meditate in the Absolute Bodhicitta.

00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:55.360
 [singing]

00:44:55.360 --> 00:45:05.360
 [singing]

00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:09.360
 From now until samsara becomes empty

00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:15.360
 I shall accomplish the benefits and happiness of all sentient parent beings.

00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:19.360
 From now until samsara becomes empty

00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:24.360
 I shall accomplish the benefits and happiness of all sentient parent beings.

00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:28.360
 From now until samsara becomes empty

00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:34.360
 I shall accomplish the benefits and happiness of all sentient parent beings.

00:45:34.360 --> 00:46:03.360
 [singing]

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:31.360

00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:53.360
 [singing]

00:49:53.360 --> 00:50:05.360
 From now until samsara becomes empty

00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:09.360
 From now until samsara becomes empty

00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:14.360
 I shall accomplish the benefits and happiness of all sentient parent beings.

00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:17.360
 From now until samsara becomes empty

00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:22.360
 I shall accomplish the benefits and happiness of all sentient parent beings.

00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:26.360
 From now until samsara becomes empty

00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:32.360
 I shall accomplish the benefits and happiness of all sentient parent beings.

00:50:52.360 --> 00:51:21.360

00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:42.360
 [singing]

00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:49.360
 We continue with accumulation of merit, the mandala offering, offering up everything.

00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:55.360
 So with the visualization, if you have your mandala plate and offerings,

00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:57.360
 then that's excellent and wonderful.

00:52:57.360 --> 00:53:02.360
 Please make offerings with that, along with all the other parts of the meditation.

00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:08.360
 And then we also have the mudra, if you don't.

00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:37.360
 [singing]

00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:42.360
 [singing]

00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:48.360
 The bodies, enjoyments, possessions and glories, the succession of all my lifetimes,

00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:53.360
 I offer to the three jewels in order to complete the two accumulations.

00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:30.360
 ...

00:59:30.360 --> 00:59:35.360

00:59:35.360 --> 00:59:40.360

00:59:40.360 --> 00:59:45.360

01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:33.360
 Above one's head is vatrasattva, inseparable from the lama,

01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:39.360
 from vatrasattva's body and an extra stream descends, purifying one's obscurations.

01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:57.360

01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:02.360
 ...

01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:07.360
 ...

01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:12.360

01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:17.360

01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:22.360

01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:37.360

01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:42.360

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:47.360

01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:52.360
