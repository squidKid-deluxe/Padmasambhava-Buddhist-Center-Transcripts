00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.420
 Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you friends. Great. Warm greetings. Yay.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:28.080
 So we're back. And yeah, as we do, we'll just really connect to the essential motivation,

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.520
 the essential goodness, the essential precious opportunity we have to be here together. So

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:40.440
 we'll do that by activating our joy and appreciation, our renunciation, doing this really quality,

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.560
 meaningful activity and time together, studying, reflecting on, and implementing the teachings

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:51.540
 of the Buddha and the Gurumbhache, the lineage in our lives and our minds right now. So we'll

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:58.120
 shine that on or enhance it or awaken it or brighten it. And then part of that is bodhichitta,

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.900
 the motivation for why we're doing this. It's really to sincerely help all beings, all the

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.840
 limitless sentient beings be free of all types of suffering and the causes of suffering so

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.840
 they can be happy. The causes of happiness, essentially recognize their own nature, their

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:21.680
 essential goodness at nature of mind and be free forever. And then thirdly, to reactivate

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:28.720
 that purity view of true nature as it expresses itself without being obscured, deluded, blocked,

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:36.440
 shut down in any way as pure nature naturally kind of manifests as experience. And we're

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:42.960
 really connecting to that right now in our own experience, what we see, what we hear,

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:50.160
 our own awareness and kind of enliven that, reconnect with renunciation, bodhichitta and

00:01:50.160 --> 00:02:16.020
 pure perception. Just kind of turn that on now.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:27.920
 Thank you, friends. It's always a very special privileged opportunity to get to reflect on

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.200
 the Dharma with you all and in my own mind. I always see this as a personal reminder to

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:40.600
 myself, just anything that I could say. It's just something that I know for myself. It's

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.840
 something I really need to care for and put attention to and nurture in my own mind and

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:52.880
 my own heart. So that's very valuable for me to have this opportunity to kind of dig

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.280
 into some things that are meaningful and personal to me, including of course, Buddha Dharma,

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:04.160
 precious lineage teachings, and then to just kind of open up some inquiries for myself

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.800
 and for others if you find them helpful or useful. And that's wonderful, kind of like

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:18.160
 look at different precious aspects of the Buddha Dharma. So the title of this talk, which

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.800
 is kind of a little bit freewheeling today. It's something that I've been thinking about

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:30.160
 for so long and just hadn't had too much time to really kind of formulate into some kind

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:41.480
 of a contemplation together, but the topic is humility and receptivity, how we face the

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:51.300
 immensity of the bodhisattva's task. So humility and receptivity, how we face the immensity

00:03:51.300 --> 00:04:07.400
 of the bodhisattva's task. So yeah, we'll jump right in. The path is long. It's long. I think

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:17.040
 it's a really good like kind of adult mature kind of adult version of Dharma to really

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:30.680
 just recognize that the path is long and the path is very surprising. We really don't know

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:38.680
 what's up ahead. And so for especially for bodhisattva's who are kind of trying to apply

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.600
 the Sutra Mahayana approach, this bodhisattva view, courageous for the enlightenment of

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:53.120
 all beings, every being, this is such a big view, a tremendously big view, not just all

00:04:53.120 --> 00:05:00.960
 humans or everyone on this planet or all sentient beings, even all manifest and unmanifest reality.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:08.000
 Like we're taking the biggest view possible here. We're going to care for everything,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.520
 our own emotions, our own thoughts, ourselves, our relationships, our friends, our enemies,

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:19.040
 our strangers for as long as it takes. So it's good to paint a picture a little bit

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:25.120
 of the immensity of this project. We're all a part of this story that is really happening

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:36.200
 right now in real time, the immensity of the bodhisattva view, infinite sentient beings,

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:44.800
 infinite, not just a big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big number, but it just keeps going.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:51.760
 Not just here in this time in this place, but everywhere, all beings everywhere, all

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:57.480
 types of beings, anything with sentience with a mind and they're in the dirt and the sky

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:03.400
 and the ground and the ocean and other planets and other dimensions seen and unseen, known

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:12.040
 and unknown, infinite sentient beings. We're really trying to open our heart like the bravery

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:20.240
 that it takes to just consider that. May I continue to help as helpfully as I can, as

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:27.800
 skillfully as I can, every single being until they completely wake up from the nightmare

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:37.640
 of samsara. May I learn all the techniques that it takes to help beings wake up. This

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:47.600
 is such a big view. This is such a big view. This is such a big view. I can't even wake

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:55.560
 myself up for a minute. Try changing one habit, you know. We've tried that. Try to change

00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:03.640
 one habit. In myself, it takes a lot of work, a lot of work. Just mundane, obvious habits

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:14.520
 like eat more greens or something. Obvious. It really takes a lot of effort and it would

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:21.320
 make me happier, eat more greens. How are we going to help all these beings, all the

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:27.280
 habits, all the deluded thoughts, all the mistaken perceptions, all the not seeing,

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:32.760
 the ignorance. Just not seeing how good everyone is, how good the situation is. This is already

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:36.160
 a pure realm, right? That's what the Tantra teachings say of the Buddha and Guru Ramachand.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:42.680
 It's already a pure realm, but we don't see that. Everyone has Buddha nature, but we don't

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:52.920
 see that. I don't see that. But we're aspiring to try to see this. We're aspiring to always

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:59.080
 have joy and contentment, deep gratitude, deep appreciation, to see the goodness in

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:05.920
 others first. Eventually, to only see the goodness in others. Eventually, to not trying

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:10.200
 to pretend or anything. We're not applying an antidote or we're not transforming something,

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:15.040
 deluded into something non-deluded. We're just seeing clearly as it is perfectly, without

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:23.960
 mistake, just pure view, enlightened view, unmistaken view. This is such an immense project.

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:33.160
 All beings, as long as it takes forever, may I come back and be born again. It's really

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:39.640
 important to see the immensity of that, because that's really what we've committed to as Bodhis

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:50.320
 Sarfas, as aspiring Bodhis Sarfas. To see that in like, what a precious vision. We look

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:53.960
 around and there's so much struggle and suffering. We look at ourselves, there's so much struggle

00:08:53.960 --> 00:09:03.760
 and suffering. May I be the balm that heals all suffering. It's such a big view we're

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:08.680
 taking on here, and how amazing. We've done that. We're taking this on. We've committed

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:14.880
 to it. We promise. We aspire. We activate this bodhicitta until all beings are free of suffering

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:23.320
 and the causes of suffering, until all beings are completely enlightened, every single being.

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:29.200
 I will come back. I will keep helping. I will do whatever it takes. I'll learn whatever

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:34.040
 language I need to learn, whatever computer language I need to learn. I'll keep coming

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:42.160
 back to this in any form that's helpful. It's such a big commitment. And where does this

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:52.800
 really lead? In my own mind, it really leads to the just matter of fact, super practical

00:09:52.800 --> 00:10:09.840
 ground level assessment of I need help. It's too big. Right now I need help. All beings

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:18.480
 forever free all of them. To even try to sustain the aspiration for a long period of time,

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:27.320
 it takes a lot of energy. What does that really mean? I need help. What I'm talking about

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:39.720
 in this is really a deep, heartfelt, genuine humility. What an amazing wish to be whatever

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:45.560
 it takes for as long as it takes to help soothe all beings and have them be completely free,

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:52.800
 for them to wake up in their own way for me to match that and to help that. What a beautiful,

00:10:52.800 --> 00:11:00.680
 beautiful, beautiful aspiration. And I need help because I'm not awakened. I'm not even

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:12.640
 partially awakened. So this is deep humility, a really deep humility. What an amazing wish

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:22.300
 to have. What an amazing path to pursue, to walk step by step. So what is this really

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:33.760
 genuine, healthy humility to face the immensity of the bodhisattva's task? I made a little

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:39.280
 list that I was just thinking of in my head. What does this mean? Really genuine humility.

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:43.800
 This isn't from like an official text or something, but just in my own mind, I mean, it's mainly

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:49.880
 inspired from Ven. K. Paramitche's book, Ceaseless Echoes of the Great Silence. It's a commentary

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:54.720
 in the Harth Sutra, Prashna Paramita, where they go through the six paramitas, which Ven.

00:11:54.720 --> 00:12:00.280
 K. Paramitche went through very extensively, each of these six paramitas, and the three

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:08.080
 types of each of these six paramitas. He did this over months when COVID-19 first happened.

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:11.880
 And we're all in lockdown, and he took the opportunity to have a big massive retreat

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:16.560
 mode for everyone who wanted to for free. And he went through these six paramitas and

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:22.440
 the three aspects of each of the six paramitas. So this is largely inspired kind of this list

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:28.200
 and this inquiry too, by that, by Rimeche's teachings, and also by their book, Ceaseless

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:37.400
 Echoes of the Great Silence, by the Kemper Rimeche's. So what is healthy humility? Healthy

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:46.440
 humility acknowledges that we're not alone. I'm not doing this alone. This is not all

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:51.880
 up to me. I didn't make these clothes, I didn't teach, I didn't learn this language on my

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:58.920
 own, I didn't create it. In so many ways, I depend on others in the world. All the amazing

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:04.040
 things that others have already done, they've already figured out, they've already offered.

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:10.480
 I'm using right now, we're all using right now this technology, these building structures,

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:14.320
 the Buddha's teachings, he figured out the four noble truths, the six paramitas, I didn't

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:19.360
 have to figure any of that out. I just show up and then I just, four noble truths, what

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:22.760
 are the four noble truths? Then I just try to remember them and apply them, but I didn't

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:29.520
 come up with that. I just totally received that as a present, the biggest present possible.

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:39.720
 Merry Christmas to me, so big, I didn't have to do any of that work. We all depend on each

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:47.520
 other and the world, we depend on so much, we are not alone. When none of us is an island,

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:54.600
 that is a mistaken view. We might feel like that sometimes, but we're really together,

00:13:54.600 --> 00:14:01.400
 we're really connected. This genuine humility sees that really, I depend on so much. It's

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:06.640
 not all, I didn't do it all. I really, then this gratitude comes, so much gratitude for

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:12.680
 experience, for life, for what our parents have done for us, our siblings, even the difficulties,

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:19.800
 like these big opportunities to learn and go deeper. Humility sees clearly, wow, how

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:26.800
 amazing to get to rely on all these, all this effort and ingenuity and just a beautiful organic

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:37.040
 naturalness of complex life. Genuine, healthy humility recognizes life is complex. It's

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:44.920
 not easy, it's not simple, it's very nuanced. Humility really takes that seriously. Free

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:52.600
 all beings, so complex. Free myself, it's so complex. Wow, so there's an opportunity to

00:14:52.600 --> 00:15:02.040
 have a wow moment there. So complex, so amazing how this all keeps going. And we didn't have

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:08.720
 to do anything, it just keeps going. That's really extraordinary. Genuine humility sees

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:16.120
 this is complex. It's not just simple, cut and dry, black and white. It's just really

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:23.800
 profound. Interdependence is very mysterious. And that's another indication of genuine humility.

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:30.720
 It doesn't try to resolve the mystery. It might try to get a little bit better orientation,

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:40.800
 so it's not so daunting or haunting or too much. We can orient things a little bit, have

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:47.640
 healthy placeholders, get little footholds. But genuine humility keeps looking, keeps

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:51.920
 looking closer and closer and closer, just like the Buddha said, when we study and contemplate,

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:59.640
 we look sharper, more clear, and we see more of the inconceivable nature, more of the vast

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:05.660
 relative spectrum of experience. So on the relative level, much more subtle detail. On

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:12.280
 the absolute level, it's just cannot be known according to any conceptual frame. It's inconceivable

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:18.760
 according to any model. It doesn't work within duality mind. So instead of trying to resolve

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:28.200
 the mystery, we try to actually connect with the mystery and let the mystery inform us,

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:36.480
 strengthen us, grow us, stretch us. And really healthy humility does that. The mystery makes

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:44.200
 the interest and the enthusiasm open more. Wow, all these beings, how can I help? How

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:48.560
 can I help you? How can I help me? All of a sudden it becomes a really big creative

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:56.360
 opportunity. And also really genuine humility is so practical. Really, what does that mean?

00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:01.480
 How can I help? That's a really practical question. That's not just some poetic kind

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:10.820
 of like pie in the sky view. Like really on the ground, how can I help? And my own emotions

00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:15.800
 are tumbling and rumbling. And when other people are going through things or just when

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:23.040
 life keeps happening, how can I help? What serves now? Genuine humility really checks

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:32.680
 into now, this time, this place, right now. That's where we can really have the, that's

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:38.880
 where we have power to make an impact and to be impacted right now. It means we have to

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:46.320
 check in with right now. You right now, me right now. I have to like check in with that

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:51.520
 and it's there. It's available to do. My mind's here. My body's here. Other people, it's all

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:57.080
 this kind of our local setting is right here waiting for us to care about it, to tune into

00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:06.680
 it. Genuine humility wants to tune into instead of just reformulate everything, take over.

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:19.720
 Genuine humility softens and inquires, leans in. All of a sudden, like how to save all beings,

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:24.000
 free all beings, awaken all beings. It's much more of a curious inquiry. It's not a, there's

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:32.480
 not one universal answer. It's always context sensitive. It's always specific to here and

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:39.520
 now. What does it mean to serve a being, to serve all beings, to really genuinely effectively

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:56.400
 help? It's very practical and it's very context specific. Genuine humility sees it, you know,

00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:03.880
 in my own mind. I see I have very specific limits. There's so much I don't know. That's

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:12.200
 not the whole story. I also have really awesome stuff too. There's a lot of good there too.

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:17.520
 In my mind, there's talents and there's limits. There's really both, but we, and we have to

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:25.060
 hold both. I'm just a limited sentient being, but this is like, we all have very unique

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:29.160
 things we're kind of sharing with it. This at the party, you know, we all have these

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:36.840
 stories, these experiences and we can learn and listen to each other and share them. And

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:42.600
 why we're all limited beings. Yay. We're all part of it. The team, you know, we can relate

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:50.080
 to each other through that. We all have these broken experiences, these hurts and this wounds

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:57.000
 and also these beautiful things, these just like unnameable, amazing things, these quiet

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:03.720
 little moments and just all ordinary everyday things, you know, brushing the teeth and get

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:10.520
 up and I don't want to wake up and I want to wake up. What's for dinner? Oh, I got to

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:16.000
 go to the bathroom again. And this is like a lot of common things that we can be, you

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:23.560
 know, if we, if we choose to see, oh, that's a way we have this together, you know, not

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:31.200
 only difference, but there's beautiful differences too. All of a sudden, there's an opportunity.

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:36.320
 This humility really cares for the differences and the commonalities, the limits and the

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:44.520
 talents. It's not just playing one side or the other. It's not, it's just really not

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:48.920
 so much playing favorites. It's trying to really, the humility is like, really, what

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:57.760
 is the richness of this moment right now? And part of seeing the limits is we don't

00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:02.880
 have control for so many things. All these things we didn't create, they were a part

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:10.020
 of, we showed up mid story to almost everything. We don't have control, but if we don't try

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:19.080
 to make it our way, there's an amazing power in it. It's already happening. We just have

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:26.280
 to kind of more go with it, go with the flow. All these chemical reactions are already happening.

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:31.640
 All these, the energy of mind is already happening. All these patterns and cycles and seasons

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:39.640
 and days and nights and karmic patterns, they're already happening. We can use it. We can go

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:46.000
 with that river of energy. We can use the creative power, but we have to be creative

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:51.360
 about it and not just be hurt by it or used by it or always fighting it, trying to make

00:21:51.360 --> 00:22:01.800
 it my way. Instead, we get humble. What's happening? Why does this keep happening? It's

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:10.680
 already happening. We get curious. How does this work? It's like a deep Buddhist question.

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:14.680
 What's going on here? How does this work? How can I work with this better? Work with

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:29.160
 this better? Not be so against it. Not just use it either. How can I learn from this?

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:38.360
 How can I care for this more? How can I appreciate this more? Be respectful of this more, and

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:48.760
 it'll just kind of give back. There's so many things that healthy humility brings. It's

00:22:48.760 --> 00:23:05.060
 directive. It learns from its mistakes. Humility keeps going. It's not self-satisfied. It wants

00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:14.600
 to learn more, more beings, more knowledge, more language, more skills. Like Sakya Pandita

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:19.840
 said, even if this is the last day of your life, use it to study. Activate your bodhicitta.

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:27.080
 Even Guru Rinpoche said that. If you come across a hammer, pick up the hammer, generate bodhicitta,

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:31.640
 and use the hammer. The next time you come across a hammer and you touch the hammer,

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:39.200
 it'll reawaken your bodhicitta. Constantly trying to use this experience to just activate

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:49.960
 your bodhicitta. To keep going. Genuine humility sees that so many beings know so much more

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:58.720
 than me. And in the context of Buddhism, or just more generally, elder wisdom, we're really

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:02.520
 not the first one to go through this, and we're not the only one, and we're not the

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:16.840
 best one, and we're not the worst one. We're not the one. Neo. We might think we are. So

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:20.960
 many beings have already looked so carefully at the mystery. They didn't resolve the mystery,

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:27.840
 they just saw clearly what the mystery was. And they're clear seeing awaken them. This

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:32.680
 elder wisdom, what does it do? It doesn't help us. It doesn't do the path for us. It

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:37.000
 doesn't make it just easy. Otherwise all the beings would have woken up now. There's so

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.640
 many countless beings around. Buddhas. There's so many Buddhas around. There's so many sentient

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:47.400
 beings around. And my sentient perception. So what does it do for us? It gives us a heads

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:53.000
 up. The elder wisdom lets us know a little bit what's around the corner. What we can't

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:59.560
 see yet. How does an enlightened being perceive things? They say, you know, that's such a

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:06.100
 valuable knowledge to know what's maybe coming up. And we can check in and try to see if it

00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:16.200
 makes sense. And we can test it. They like provide the whole path to actually test it.

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:24.940
 How amazing to have all this lineage wisdom and these living noble beings. And they never

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:31.640
 do the path for us, but they can prevent a lot of kind of same old habits, same old mistakes,

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:39.860
 same old wasted time. Infinite sentient life, infinite samsara from this beginningless time.

00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:45.000
 They can show us the techniques to purify all this karma so quickly, but they can't

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:56.260
 do it for us. But they can show us the easiest way to do it. And we still have to do it.

00:25:56.260 --> 00:26:02.080
 They can show us the best way to tune into what's happening right now. And then refine

00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:08.320
 that view more and more. More subtly, more fully, more inclusively experience what's

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:15.240
 happening right now in a full spectrum way and increasing humility gets more and more

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:23.640
 overflowing with insight. Why? It really knows more clearly what it doesn't know. Genuine

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:31.680
 humility is really honest about what it doesn't know, which is almost everything. It's also

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:39.520
 really, really honest about the unknown unknowns. Like I don't know. There's so much I don't

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:44.360
 know. I don't know. I find that every day I learned more things. I have no idea they

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:50.000
 were happening. There's so many fields of knowledge. There's so many expert people.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.760
 There's history so fast. There's so much I don't know. And there's so much I have no

00:26:54.760 --> 00:27:02.000
 idea that I don't know. And genuine humility makes these two clearer. Both like we have

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:10.240
 a question and we really have no clue even how to begin kind of like engaging that, responding.

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:13.080
 And then there's so many things. We don't even have a question about it. It's so far

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:19.420
 over our head. It doesn't even come up as a question yet. And this lineage wisdom shows

00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:27.680
 us both. What's around the corner pretty close? What's around the corner really far away?

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:35.000
 And so if we have humility, like how does such benefit? We have this full path view.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:41.940
 And it makes it so much easier and so much more empowered. And so much more practical.

00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:51.160
 And it really becomes a question of trust. How can we trust? When someone says something's

00:27:51.160 --> 00:28:00.940
 way around the corner and we can't see it for ourselves. Really genuine humility makes

00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:10.200
 us become more receptive to life. We're more available to be moved by life. And in secular

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:19.740
 terms is called to bear witness. We're more empowered to really authentically bear witness.

00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:26.680
 Even if we can't do anything, we can just be with people. We can just be with the tragedy

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:34.120
 of life and the beauty of it and the horror and the just in love. There's so many things

00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:41.020
 to love in life. And we don't have to do anything. We can just be with it. We can just appreciate

00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:48.960
 it. We can just suffer through it and be with it in that. We can just offer company connection.

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:59.920
 Wow, it's really hard. Oh, this is so beautiful. We're opening ourselves to more of the variety

00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:04.340
 of what's happening. That's called our field of karmic vision is expanding. We're seeing

00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:11.460
 more clearly. We're including more interdependence. We're being moved by it more. And we're also

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:15.340
 tuning into like how we're being moved. And if there's other ways we'd like to move with

00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:20.180
 that flow, the river that are more helpful, more empowering, more heart opening, more

00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:25.460
 clarifying, then we start to see those patterns more clearly when we're really humble. And

00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:30.780
 all of a sudden we tune into others more and we see what might be a little more helpful

00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:44.620
 in this situation. Oh, just don't do anything. Don't say anything. Or give this gift. Or

00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:54.280
 just be kind. Just pray from a distance. Or just forgive. All of a sudden we tune into

00:29:54.280 --> 00:30:02.860
 all these patterns. So many beings. And then when we tune in in that way, it makes us so

00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:07.900
 much more interested in their experience and their stories. And our personal story gets

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:15.220
 a little more ho-hum. I know my story pretty well. I mean, there's so many kind of distorted

00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:22.300
 things I don't see about myself. But more or less, I know my, you know, drakpa story.

00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:27.380
 And we start tuning in with others. Wow. It becomes really fascinating. So many other beings,

00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:33.260
 so many stories, so many experiences, so many insights that I don't personally have to go

00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:39.720
 through in a way. They're also giving, they're like, it's like elders. They're helping me

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:43.260
 see something I haven't seen before. I haven't been in their shoes. I don't know. And they're

00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:47.560
 showing me what's it like from in that way through that experience, like a little bit

00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:57.120
 of an insight. And all of a sudden the view opens a little. And so that's what receptivity

00:30:57.120 --> 00:31:07.260
 really does. It opens our view. We're willing to have our own view, our own frames open.

00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:12.580
 And the real honest part of that path, if we're talking about adult Buddha Dharma, the

00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:20.260
 real honest part of that path is when we open our view, it really does feel like dying.

00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:33.060
 It's a breaking. We have to break our pattern and remake a new pattern. Break and remake

00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:41.060
 our frames, our views. Why do we break a view? Why do we extend it, stretch it, open it?

00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:45.460
 Because it's too limited. It's too tight. It's not actually big enough to include the

00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:51.540
 rich, vast nature of reality. So at a certain point of our view, it starts really kind of

00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:59.340
 bursting at the seams because life is too much for it. Our view, our box is too small

00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:05.860
 and we have to open it. Those growing pains that we've all been through. And it's a part

00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:12.300
 of samsara. And here we're talking about extending a view and going through that kind of tension,

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:18.280
 the difficulty, the dis-ease, the uncomfortability, the fear, the new knowing, a new ways of

00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:20.160
 knowing.

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:26.420
 They always come along with having a bigger view. Feeling more fully, connecting more

00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:31.940
 richly with people, bearing witness to other people's stories, their experiences, their

00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:44.180
 losses and loves. It really aches. And then it takes time for things to gel more, for

00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:50.940
 our view to expand and kind of settle. It takes time and we need help. It's a deep humility.

00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:58.340
 We really need help. We're not talking about getting a final view as if it's the final

00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:05.780
 answer to every question. We're talking about a flexibility of moving in between views in

00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:12.500
 ways that are really helpful for other people according to their views. The emptiness is

00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:22.980
 the flexibility to move in and out and between views. Our frames. Because that's what reality

00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:29.700
 does. It's called interdependence. Dependent arising. All of a sudden with humility, we're

00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:38.660
 a part, an important part, an essential part of a much bigger whole, a much bigger story.

00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:48.820
 It's so empowering. It's not just me. It's not just me alone. That genuine humility.

00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:54.300
 So I've really been careful to say this healthy humility or genuine humility. What does this

00:33:54.300 --> 00:34:05.420
 all come down to in a Buddhist context? Lineage. Lineage. Lineage. These noble beings who've

00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:12.820
 seen so clearly and so vastly, who have this deep, really lived experience, at least first

00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:23.020
 Bhoomi bodhisattva experience, of really being with the true nature as it is, and really

00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:30.020
 commanding that aspiration to free all beings for as long as it takes, no matter what. They

00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:35.740
 have that bodhicitta. It's on and it's uninterruptedly on. It doesn't waver anymore. It's just

00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:36.100
 always

00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:41.660
 on. Then it's the question of having some of these habits. This is through the 10 Bhoomis,

00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:50.580
 these habits, the old karmic habits, still have to shed. We still have to stretch, grow.

00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:55.980
 But that's the big game changer, this first Bhoomi. And there are noble beings in the

00:34:55.980 --> 00:35:03.900
 world now. And their teachings are all around. And they can help us go through that process.

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:09.500
 And our humility, all of a sudden, they're like, wow, we see them all over. We really

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:16.980
 have genuine humility. There's so many noble beings in the world right now. Obvious ones.

00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:21.260
 Not trying to figure out how that rock is an actual emanated Buddha or something. Not

00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:26.500
 trying to like, because the Buddha's teachings said there's mandalas everywhere. And I'm

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:31.420
 talking about obvious, apparent noble beings that anyone with a duludu perception like

00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:41.180
 myself can see, like as holy as Dalai Lama, such a noble being. So obvious. And they're

00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:46.580
 around and their teachings are all over and we can apply them. And we can ask, I mean,

00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:52.100
 really, it's like such an amazing time. But it's really good. I found it's really good

00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:58.220
 to say and to remember and to emphasize that it really is a stretching process. Becoming

00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:06.460
 humble, deeply humble, surrendering. Really having deep veneration. Like deep veneration,

00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:12.220
 like what we're doing with prostrations in Indra, like deep veneration for the nature,

00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:16.660
 the nature inside, the nature outside, those who've realized it fully, my own nature that's

00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:21.680
 like opening up a little more. It's really deep veneration for all things all around

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:30.420
 for this amazing process we're a part of. Such a deep veneration. But that little stretching

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:37.260
 is really part of it. It's part of the path. And we need to expect it. Because if no one

00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:43.020
 gives us a heads up that it's a little difficult, once that comes, the tension comes and we

00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:47.600
 actually have to grow our frame. And that means we have to kind of like give up some

00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:59.620
 old habits and make new healthy habits. It requires a lot of participation, doesn't it?

00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:15.860
 It's a lot of participation. And it's so good. It's so worthwhile. So worthwhile. But we're

00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:22.340
 intentionally kind of letting these noble beings help us get a little bit of it's called

00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:29.060
 a hormesis, hormesis. They're giving us a little bit, a little bit of stress, just enough

00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:35.620
 for our system to be a little curious about it, you know. And then it starts to adapt,

00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:41.500
 get a little more flexible. There's a little rug pulling. There's a little tension. And

00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:46.500
 it's just in this Goldilocks range. It's just enough little friction that our system has

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:51.380
 to wake up. And our mindfulness has to turn on. Oh, what's going on? This is a little

00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:56.860
 different. I'm not sure what's going on. It's like homeopathy. It's also they say it's like

00:37:56.860 --> 00:38:01.180
 that process is like in when you exercise, it's like your muscles literally have to tear

00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:09.420
 a little for them to strengthen more, to have stronger bonds. That hormesis process, like

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:15.340
 if we get in a trusting relationship with a noble being, that's part of the process.

00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:19.820
 They're going to give us a little bit that's a little beyond what we can handle. So we

00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:26.900
 can grow, adapt, get more creative, juggle a little more. And what we're trying to do

00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:32.300
 is get so much so that we can do that with ourselves. We push our own buttons. We don't

00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:38.460
 let things get too stale and static. We remain constant and reliable and really genuinely

00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:45.700
 humble and in reverence of life, of this process, the process of the path, not the contents

00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:53.020
 of the path, not the visions and the experiences and the things, but the process, the unfolding,

00:38:53.020 --> 00:39:00.140
 the opening, the insights, not so much the what we're insightful about, but being in

00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:07.220
 a phase of insight, being in an extraordinary seeing. The Vipassana itself, the point is

00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:14.840
 to stay in Vipassana. It's not just to see stuff, it's to stay in Vipassana. That's the

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:20.620
 union of Shyamata and Vipassana, to stay in insight all the time and to not get hooked

00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:29.500
 up on any detail, to care for the details, but to not grab a detail. Because then we

00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:34.980
 lock into a view and then we can't help others according to what's the content of their story,

00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:43.140
 of their experience. We kind of basically glue ourselves too tightly to certain frames when

00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:47.740
 we need to have that flexibility to seamlessly kind of move in and out and be responsive

00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:51.780
 to what is happening right now in real time with those who are around and with our own

00:39:51.780 --> 00:40:04.140
 minds and our own hearts. Wow, we have this lineage and there's by so many ways we can,

00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:10.860
 the Buddha taught, Jigme Lingpa taught, Satsum Lingpa taught, so many of these great masters

00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:15.980
 taught how we can look into the lineage to see whether it's authentic or not, according

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:22.820
 to Borichitta standards. There's so many teachings they gave on this, how to test what's a

00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:23.540
 qualified

00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:29.660
 teacher, what's a qualified student, and it's really worth engaging that. And also to re-engage

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:34.180
 it because then we can reactivate our appreciation for these amazing qualified teachers that

00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:41.500
 are around. We can really kind of bring that back freshly to mind like wow, what an opportunity

00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:45.820
 to be able to apply their teachings. And when things get rough, things get a little tight,

00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:49.960
 they get a little tense or something, to refresh and be like wow, this is actually like such

00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:56.860
 a big opportunity to grow further. That's why in these six parmitu practices, the three

00:40:56.860 --> 00:41:00.580
 points that really kind of like freshened in my mind that's really kind of around this

00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:10.100
 topic of humility and receptivity is patience. Patience with hardships on the path. That's

00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:15.460
 the second type of patience. The third type of patience is patience with the ups and downs

00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:25.240
 of life. Patience with hardships on the path, knowing it's going to come. That process of

00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:31.100
 opening, of inquiring, of staying fresh, it's very demanding. It really requires us to keep

00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:39.020
 showing up. It cares about us that much. It really keeps asking us to participate. And

00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:43.900
 it's so kind because then it just matches us with however far we're willing to go. Then

00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:47.220
 reality does that. It's kind of extraordinary how that happens. And these living teachers

00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:51.580
 do that too. Patience with hardships on the path. And patience with the ups and downs

00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:56.580
 of life. Samsara. As long as we're in duality mind cycles, then it's going to be, or it's

00:41:56.580 --> 00:42:01.340
 going to bang around against stuff and lose things that we love and get things we don't

00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:06.820
 want. It's just part of it. So that, and I'm not saying that's easy, patience is a really

00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:18.320
 hard one for me. Patience to be with. Be with it. The hardship, the ups and downs. The third

00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:23.060
 part of the paramitas that really kind of struck me is when we get into the joyful effort

00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:29.260
 paramita. Unflinching paramita, that's the kind of topic here. Unflinching paramita is

00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:36.340
 not flinching with the immensity of the bodhisattva's task. That joyful effort. We're going to keep

00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:43.700
 going so immense when you really get the impact of the immensity of that task. Don't flinch.

00:42:43.700 --> 00:43:02.620
 That's the first type of joyful effort. Such a noble, such a noble wish. Insatiable joyful

00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:09.980
 effort. I think this is the second type. I think it's the third type. But no matter what

00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:15.820
 good we've done, how many beings we've helped, one, two, whatever experience we had in practice,

00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:24.100
 insatiable as it keeps wanting to do more. More help, more helpful. Help even again. Let

00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:31.980
 me have that be more effective, more heartfelt, more humble, more connected. Insatiable joyful

00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:39.460
 effort. It doesn't get self satisfied with, oh, I did this and I built that and had that.

00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:45.500
 It's not satisfied with its list of accomplishments. That happened. Okay, this is great. We should

00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:53.960
 rejoice in any good thing we do and use it as fuel to do even more. We should really

00:43:53.960 --> 00:44:01.820
 do that. Yeah. So that's the second joyful effort. And the third is unceasing. And that's what

00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:01.940
 these

00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:08.340
 noble bodhisattvas do. Day and night, all the time, unceasing joyful effort. It's a lovely

00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:15.940
 experience for them. They've really seen the nature uninterruptedly. Wow, how amazing. So

00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:23.420
 noble to behold such beings. And that's really kind of what comes down to this lineage. Like

00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:27.820
 really, the lineage, what has the lineage done for us? The lineage, I mean, it has done

00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:38.020
 so much for us. But one amazing thing the lineage has done for us is that when life

00:44:38.020 --> 00:44:48.660
 gets really hard, the lineage has given us all kinds of sets of heuristics called rules

00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:56.980
 of thumb, things to remember. That when life gets hard, when some sorrow gets too much,

00:44:56.980 --> 00:45:06.660
 the Dharma lineage has given us so many systems of these simple, easy to remember tips. And

00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:13.100
 so it's too hard and we start shutting down. We can remember the four noble truths. We

00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:20.420
 can remember the four turnings of our mind to Dharma. We can remember the four seals,

00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:27.620
 sometimes the nine yanas. We can remember bodhicitta. We can remember the six paramitas.

00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:37.700
 And these are all complete systems. They're like in Longchenpa's treasury of pith instructions.

00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:44.180
 It's like hundreds of pages of all these complete exhaustive systems of how you can cut up the

00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:53.300
 pie of reality into these completely 100% contained systems. And they're all these super easy

00:45:53.300 --> 00:46:00.320
 to remember pith instructions, these heuristics, rules of thumb. And if we can remember them,

00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:06.420
 study them some, make them a little bit kind of more easy to pop into our minds, then when

00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:14.300
 things get really hard, we can have an extra handhold, right? It's like a good example

00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:18.860
 is like if you're climbing, climbing, like literally rock climbing, free climbing, no

00:46:18.860 --> 00:46:24.380
 lines, and all of a sudden you get to a spot and you don't have a handhold or a foothold

00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:30.700
 and you are stuck and your body starts freezing and the fear of death starts happening. What

00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:39.780
 it clicks on, three points of contact. Always maintain three points of contact. It's a heuristic.

00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:45.380
 It's a rule of thumb. When everything else fails, the thing that clicks on and the Buddha

00:46:45.380 --> 00:46:52.340
 Dharma is filled with those and it's just a treasure trove of all this practical advice

00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:57.600
 that if we go into a few points like the Four Noble Truths, it's everything. It's the entire

00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:04.620
 Buddha Dharma. And we didn't have to figure out any of it. It was all just given to us.

00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:11.540
 The Buddha already taught this. These lineage masters have maintained this. It's still intact.

00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:15.860
 Whatever simple rules of thumb help us now, it's all there. And if we really pursue even

00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:20.780
 one of them, some lo-jung slogans, some pith instructions we receive from our personal

00:47:20.780 --> 00:47:28.220
 nature, it's enough. It's a complete path. And we can really keep going with that for

00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:36.780
 decades. This nundra practice is a complete path. Patermice did nundra 25 times and did

00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:42.420
 all the accumulations that said he did all the accumulations of nundra 25 times. It's

00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:47.540
 a complete path. And we have all these ways that we can like, if we get humble and we're

00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:54.860
 willing to see the immense preciousness of the Buddha Dharma that we've received, then

00:47:54.860 --> 00:48:01.660
 the immensity of the bodhisattva's task becomes, it really kind of radically shifts something

00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:10.780
 in our minds. And it can reawaken this courage that we can do this, that my nature is capable

00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:16.460
 of this. This Buddha nature is there and it's in everyone. And we have these paths and we

00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:25.060
 can test these paths and we can use this moment right now to awaken and to really tune in

00:48:25.060 --> 00:48:30.740
 to what's happening around us and inside of us and get really humble and really quiet

00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:41.100
 and really caring and really listen, really receive. And that's what all these noble beings

00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:54.780
 do. So it's, yeah, such a beautiful path. It's really such an amazingly beautiful path. And

00:48:54.780 --> 00:49:00.060
 we're not alone. So many beings have done it. There's so many noble beings around who

00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:04.580
 are doing it. There's so many invisible beings who are doing it, who are helping us and the

00:49:04.580 --> 00:49:09.380
 lineage is there. And if we really get humble and kind of quiet ourselves more and more

00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:15.260
 and more, that humility is going to connect us to all these resources that we have that

00:49:15.260 --> 00:49:21.100
 are just part of reality. And when the times get difficult, we feel disconnected, we get

00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:26.600
 lost, we can rely on some of these very, we can pull back, get a bird's eye view and rely

00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:34.260
 on some very basic essential teachings that will clarify so much and help us kind of get

00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:47.980
 a bigger perspective and to really kind of open up in a soft way and not in a severe

00:49:47.980 --> 00:49:54.660
 way. But all of a sudden, wow, I have an infinite time to connect with all these beings. That's

00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:59.820
 such a softer way to think of it. Instead of, oh, I have to endlessly go through birth

00:49:59.820 --> 00:50:05.820
 and death and the this and struggle and learn all this stuff. All this opportunity to like,

00:50:05.820 --> 00:50:12.020
 wow, I get another time to communicate with you. All of a sudden it becomes like a beautiful

00:50:12.020 --> 00:50:18.540
 opportunity. Like Maitreya said, going from garden to garden, strolling from garden to

00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:23.060
 garden like when we really turn into that Borichitta. And all of a sudden really it

00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:29.100
 becomes much more of a tremendously grateful opportunity that we have to keep doing this

00:50:29.100 --> 00:50:35.580
 practice together to study the Buddha Dharma and to learn little by little and open little

00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:48.380
 by little. So thank you, kind of meander around a little bit, but hopefully it was a nice,

00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:55.780
 some more of a stroll and less of a chaotic maze. Hope it was helpful. Thank you friends.

00:50:59.100 --> 00:51:15.940
 Just regarding humility and receptivity, something to also mention is that for one's

00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:21.220
 own path, like if we're trying to consider our own path, how's it going? How's my path

00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:28.180
 going? I think I've found that humility and our receptivity, our interest in kind of learning

00:51:28.180 --> 00:51:34.780
 new things and seeing in different ways is a really easy kind of litmus test for whether

00:51:34.780 --> 00:51:40.220
 our path is kind of like going in the right direction. And then similarly, if we're looking

00:51:40.220 --> 00:51:49.340
 for some guidance for a teacher who's reliable, those seem to be two qualities that really

00:51:49.340 --> 00:51:58.340
 are outstanding, like that someone's genuinely humble and also really curious about seeing

00:51:58.340 --> 00:52:03.260
 in new ways and they're kind of tuned in to what's going on around them. And like with

00:52:03.260 --> 00:52:09.660
 a lot of enthusiasm, so really receptive. I think those are two really clear, obvious

00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:17.460
 indications that, you know, just at the, you know, very face level that kind of to inspire

00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:22.180
 trust, at least in the beginning for like further inquiry into like seeing if that's

00:52:22.180 --> 00:52:29.100
 a trustable guide to rely on. Then thirdly, for humility with the great teachings like

00:52:29.100 --> 00:52:37.580
 Zogchen, it's very like clearly said that the essential practice, the essential practice

00:52:37.580 --> 00:52:48.540
 of Zogchen is guru yoga like we just did. And that's all about feeling a very close, warm

00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:54.740
 kind of sizzling connection to the lineage, like a really humble, open kind of willing

00:52:54.740 --> 00:53:04.460
 to receive the lineage blessings, really willing to connect to reality, the true nature. So

00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:09.740
 that's a kind of strong point there that that humility and that kind of receptivity is really

00:53:09.740 --> 00:53:16.740
 crucially important with these high, high practices like Zogchen, for example. And then

00:53:16.740 --> 00:53:23.460
 thirdly, or sorry, fourthly, that I really don't see a way around humility. If we're

00:53:23.460 --> 00:53:29.420
 really, I mean, talking about non-dual kind of waking up, if we're talking about wisdom

00:53:29.420 --> 00:53:34.580
 and seeing clearly, supreme seeing the way it's talked about in Buddhism, like non-dual

00:53:34.580 --> 00:53:44.900
 realization, then a deep humility will let us really clearly see like how demanding that

00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:50.580
 process is of being in a moment of wisdom is one thing, but sustaining that moment as

00:53:50.580 --> 00:53:57.260
 a meditation that integrates with all aspects of your life, that really requires a lot of

00:53:57.260 --> 00:54:03.680
 supports, a lot of relative supports. So we really have to connect in with a lot of skillful

00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:10.500
 means at that point, we have to be humble to receive that support and queued in to like

00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:14.340
 actually really pay attention to the support, the feedback we're getting from life, from

00:54:14.340 --> 00:54:19.740
 our experience to actually maintain that open view. And then even these noble beings who

00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:25.900
 are maintaining that view all the time, then the question of humility and receptivity is

00:54:25.900 --> 00:54:30.260
 constantly tuning in to the skillful means that are going to be most effective to helping

00:54:30.260 --> 00:54:35.180
 beings right now. So if they're not using the support to sustain their view, because

00:54:35.180 --> 00:54:41.380
 they're already sustaining their view, they're still queuing into all of the patterns at

00:54:41.380 --> 00:54:47.340
