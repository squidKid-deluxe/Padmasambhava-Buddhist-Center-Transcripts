00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.420
 This is my walk, that's it. I'm not sure I'm going to...when I show this I'm not going to...I'm not

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:12.000
 sure I'm going to be hired!

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 But you're going to have this each hour, I mean how much?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 [Applause]

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.460
 Thank you. This is a...I mean I put all the kirumud you do. This is mainly I designed this for the

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.000
 kirumud you're doing.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:58.300
 But also I designed a kurda in the Great Basho Mohoramudi, this instruction in Dessatici, so I try

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.000
 to follow with that, and all these different mantras as he instructed.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.470
 So that's what really I follow with that. And then also this center is the...this big part is the k

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:16.000
irumud, his dreams, that he had this dream about 1991 in Florida,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:25.550
 sometimes in early morning. So that means just around 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning he said he

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.000
 dreamed this, and he woke up, he felt so happy,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:41.630
 and he remembered still that was the dream, the time. And he saw, he said in each direction, there

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:42.000
's beautiful sun is rising, and there's maybe 7 or 9 horsemen is coming.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.110
 And they are all singing these prayers, singing, and he came toward him and the karmos kind of dev

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.000
oured to him.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.030
 And then he felt so happy that moment he woke up. The moment he woke up he remembered that he's

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.000
 kind of something really significant.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:06.090
 So then he wrote the dawn, which is about 6 lines, which is a bigger part in that aspect that I

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.000
 wrote, wrote that.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.360
 And it is kind of a little bit complicated, but it's very beautiful meaning, beautiful meaning, and

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.000
 say that, and that, that roughly translation.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:26.350
 And this is where the Dokam, the east, east where there is a beautiful land of the rich, perfectly

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:32.000
 jeweled, and where is a beautiful sound of the clothes of the joy.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:42.070
 And the banner of the joy is raising, and that which will dominate the entire city, this universe,

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.000
 and that is the power and the amazing of the Dabla,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.650
 or the warrior deities of the Kesa, I think. That will remain inseparably with the crown of the

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.000
 warrior horse.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.230
 How wonderful, I mean, how beautiful. And that is really the roughly translation of this word

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.000
 meaning.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.560
 And so, here we had this in the cabin. The cabin, you can hang up that, and then I just thought to

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.000
 make this a prayer place, and make all the beautiful wishes.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.100
 And the wishes to follow all the wishes of the great master lineages, and as well as our inspir

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.000
ations, thoughts.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 And then follow the essence, called the Muramudya instructions.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 And then I, I mean, he should write, here is, I, he should have the Garuda, actually.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 And here he should have the Dagon. And here he should have the lower part in the left.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.630
 And here they should have the tag and the lines. And you can't write, at least put the names, he

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:49.000
 said. So I did the names.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 Okay, so that's it. That's it. So this is my almost two days.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 And I did, did this, made this plaques, made this. And I followed with this, kind of just thought,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 I thought really to design long time ago, since last year.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.840
 But I couldn't do, and then at this time is approaching, I thought to put up there, this is what my

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.000
, one of my thought to have this prayer place post.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 And so time is coming, and then, yes, design is five colors, which is five, five Muslims.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:32.750
 And so this is the blue, and then yellow, red, white, and this is the green, and this is kind of

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.000
 like roughly there.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.240
 And so that's my brief stories, and now it's going to raise up with all the beautiful prayer pl

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.000
aques. Thank you, thank you.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.480
 Now you really, then, you all do. Well, we are, we are going to, most of the people, we are going

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.000
 to experience and join the mantra of the Guru of Amma Sambhava.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.640
 and then you all for that. Thank you.
