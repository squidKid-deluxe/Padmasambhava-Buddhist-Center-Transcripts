00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.160
 Thank you very much for this video. Thank you again. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.750
 Again, we completely understand that our motivation, beautiful motivation of the new and

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:22.430
 application, has been great for many reasons. Really, I mean, it's a... We have so many... In the

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:28.870
 walking level, we have so many good times, but definitely we should be grateful. Great time and

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:29.980
 just happy.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.580
 You're in your... And then the spiritual, the Dharma level, we have so many good things. Dharma,

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:41.020
 Dharma level, and then for the Lord, we are connected to the Walking people.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.860
 They call it teaching, all the lineage masters teach it into the highest teaching, teaching of the

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:48.720
 greatest teacher, the greatest teacher of the Buddha, Satyamuni ever gave. All the goddess, there's

00:00:48.720 --> 00:01:00.020
 nothing higher to be more, I mean, talking than that, really, they're teaching always, they say.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:07.680
 Because the reason is directly is discovery and connected with our inner nature, nature of the

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:15.960
 Buddha nature, nature of the mind, Satyamuni ever. All the other Buddha's teaching, generally, or

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:25.530
 until the lokshi, lokshi teaching is all connected with mind. Mind is leading the mind. Mind is

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.020
 leading the mind.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:34.390
 So mind is a sport of mind, which is wonderful. It is like, as the homo-pathetic techniques. Use

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:43.020
 the same technique to dispel the difficulty of that trouble. Same technique is homo-pathetic.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:51.310
 So all that, until the lokshi is mind, by just helping to the mind, and then moving to the

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.020
 enlightenment, which is wonderful.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.250
 And the lokshi teaching, particularly also in the teaching method, is like big instructional

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:05.170
 teaching. What we follow, talk to children, talk about teaching, is really directly, not just mind

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.020
 by mind, is directly connected to them, versatile, pretty much, you're versatile.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:18.720
 So it's versatile. It's two versatile. What did the teaching say? Use mind as part or the versatile

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:28.530
 as part. All the other teachings are used mind as part. Part is the progress, realization, to break

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:29.020
 it.

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:39.620
 But no kidding. Estently, versatile as part. That immediately connect to the nature. And also we

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.020
 measured, or according to the teaching, I have read it and you've all heard so many times.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:50.800
 What that is, for example, is a symbol. Look into the lookers. That moment, we are to the ultimate

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.020
 state of the true nature.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:03:01.480
 There is nothing higher, deeper, vast, and profound, fewer than that, really. But now, what it is,

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.020
 we have to maintain. That is what we have to keep.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:13.420
 Also maintaining, although we maintain, exactly as nature, the wisdom, the primordial wisdom, those

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.020
 are techniques used as immovable techniques we maintain in it.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:25.680
 And any duality, any interpretation, we liberate it. Those are techniques we do. During the fourth

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.020
 meditation, we liberate it. During the fourth meditation, we liberate it.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:38.150
 And we can. As much as we can liberate all the disturbance, emotion, and philosophical, that means,

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.020
 that is sign of how we are good practitioners.

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:48.580
 And we can liberate it, as it arises. Incidentally, we are the top cookies itself. Really, top

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.020
 cookies of the practitioners. You are now fellowship.

00:03:53.020 --> 00:04:01.690
 But we can liberate it after two seconds, or three minutes, or fifteen minutes. Still good, not

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.020
 whole day.

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:09.970
 Then, but if you carry that continuity, even if you practice the doctrine, and you carry that

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.020
 continuity, then almost we are the same as a good person, unpractical.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:19.710
 I think it might be really difficult. So, measurement of the realization is not somebody says

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:24.020
 something to you, or something you have dreamed, or vision, all these things.

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:30.020
 Ask ourselves, how much really we are progressing, how much are we liberating?

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:36.020
 And then, same time in teaching, you say, how much joy you have, how much appreciation you have,

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.020
 how much body together you have.

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:45.020
 Kind is comparable. Those are the nugget signs of the realization, achievement in the teaching.

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:53.020
 She really says, all the others, visions, and dreams, and somebody says, I might be told that this,

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.020
 that is all we trick into ourselves.

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:02.680
 Not really that. But ever we happen, all those beautiful dreams and visions, same time we have so

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:08.020
 much compassion, love, kindness, and we can liberate all the emotions of that.

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:15.020
 That is meant. That is meant. Then that vision, dreams are good, is a true sign.

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:23.350
 But otherwise, those dreams and visions, many times in the teaching, they are tricking, tricking,

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:28.020
 tricking, and that will then deviated us from the part and the meaning strings.

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:37.020
 Therefore, be practical. Be practical. Be practical, strong, and more sensible, stay on the ground.

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:42.820
 Not powered, carried by the force of the whole different. That is what the great Master Padra means

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:47.020
. Not carried by the rainbow balls.

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:52.870
 And kind of talking, holding things, but the reality is nothing really happens, happens in our

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.020
 heart and mind.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:06:01.020
 So, all those reasons, we have such a beautiful, really teaching, all that we are connected with.

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:08.020
 This is great, generally Buddha teaching, particularly Dandar teaching, and Shakyi teaching. It's

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:08.020
 our trick.

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:13.020
 Your trick is not something that is happened, truly you are connected to these.

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:19.020
 In Buddha teaching, there is no good extent of that. Always has beautiful cause and condition.

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:26.020
 On the scene, behind the scene, power, distance, sense, that's all coming, kind of mutualizing.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:33.110
 And therefore, really this all connected with you. Generally you have devotion, joy, appreciation,

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:35.020
 particularly Dharma.

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:41.020
 And particularly Shakyi teaching, it's your, that means you are connected, truly you are connected.

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:48.680
 Therefore, by having those things, increasing more joy and appreciation, devotion, bodhicata, that

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:53.020
 will make more blooms, more glowing, more really act really there.

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:58.020
 And then just become one of the really beautiful person beings in this world.

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:05.020
 And we have to be, we can be happy in joy, be simple, humble, be happy in joy.

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:11.020
 But live this world with joy and happy, happy in our future, right.

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:15.020
 This tradition is really bright, according to teaching and all the great markets.

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:20.020
 And we have to be, because the cause tells the future.

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:23.020
 How what we are doing now will tell the future.

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:29.020
 Even though we don't see the future, we don't have omniscient to judge the future.

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:35.600
 Whatever you do, good things, good things, rest upon the competition, bodhicata, and practice all

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:36.020
 this.

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:40.020
 That really tells the future is how that will be.

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:48.020
 Well be there for me all, this, with practice is so, so special and feel happy in joy, with that,

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:51.020
 and then bodhicata, thought, vastness, motivation, bodhicata.

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:57.270
 Again, the motivation, vastness, motivation, bodhicata, for all sentient beings, living beings, and

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:59.020
 wishing good things.

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:06.390
 Even we do short practice meditation, but we do good bodhicata, thought, really energy, it makes so

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:08.020
 much powerful, so much powerful.

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:13.960
 And then we dedicated that magic also with the same way for all the living beings, not just

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.020
 selected these, that, that.

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:21.320
 We can highlight those loved ones, we love that, to that person, and then all the basic sentient

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:22.020
 beings.

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:29.960
 That's dedicated, that this, the body that are taught all the time in a dedication and aspirations

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.020
 are so, so important.

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:40.490
 You know, teaching mentioned really the aspiration is the, the tool, T-O-O, and tool to actualize

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:44.020
 all the realizations and performance, all the vehicles.

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:47.020
 When we do the aspiration, we're making wish.

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:53.020
 That means we openly draw what we like to be in the future, what we like to achieve.

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:56.020
 And may all living beings be free from suffering.

00:08:56.020 --> 00:09:03.260
 That is intention. You said it holds a mind, but everything is according to Buddhism, it's created

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.020
 by mind, everything.

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:12.100
 Everything is not started, it came to us. We started, our mind started, then we activate, then we

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:13.020
 perform.

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:18.020
 All the fulfillment is started from the mind.

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:26.020
 And we do the good aspirations. Aspirations, really that is the tool in the Buddha's teaching.

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:34.530
 See, aspiration is so important, with good heart, with God, bodhicata, and with every aspiration,

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:36.020
 pray for that.

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:42.020
 And it's also wish in bodhicata, wish in bodhicata, bodhicata has two, right?

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:48.020
 Wish in bodhicata, actualize in bodhicata. Wish in bodhicata is a wish-sentient day.

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:51.020
 That means you're not, you can't do it immediately.

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:56.750
 Immediately by the word, physically, verbally, you cannot solve the problem, but sincerely you're

00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:57.020
 wish.

00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:04.020
 We're wishing. How long? Wish. May all living beings have happiness and cause of happiness.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:14.020
 Now, sincerely thinking that, and my thinking says, when bodhicata, when we reach for some limits,

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:19.020
 when we reach for this.

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:26.020
 For example, parama das, sixth parama das is already known.

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:33.020
 The sixth parama das, last parama das, the sixth parama das, which is the western parama das, is

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:36.020
 divided into four more, four more.

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:47.720
 Those are known as parama das of the skilled beings, parama das of the aspirations, parama das of

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.020
 the power.

00:10:49.020 --> 00:11:15.260
 The parama das of the power, parama das of the aspirations, parama das of the western, the promoted

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:16.020
 western.

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:22.020
 Those are four parama das divided for the more, these western parama das.

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:30.230
 And this when that, for further, the aspiration parama das, on the ninth booming in the teaching

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:31.020
 city.

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:38.020
 So it's like, almost the last booming, the for furthering, the aspirations.

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:44.020
 For example, bodhicaka, when we joined, the gracious teacher, you met 500 aspirations.

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:47.020
 You praised the white lotus.

00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:51.020
 That aspiration, same as we met aspirations.

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:54.020
 We came over the same thing, being free from suffering.

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:57.020
 The same aspirations.

00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:00.020
 Buddha did 500 different.

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:02.020
 And you praised the white lotus.

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:08.020
 Whoever, whoever gave your name, names, will not return to the samsara.

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:14.790
 The most gracious teacher, I feel, how many? It's true, that's what we, praise, that's the great

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:16.020
 master, the master of praise.

00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:24.020
 Because aspirations, because aspirations, all the Buddhas appreciated him as white lotus.

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:31.020
 Among all the lotus, lotus, there's so many red lotus, but there's only one white lotus.

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:38.180
 In the teaching city, the initial time, long before the Buddhas get enlightenment, during the

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:39.020
 development of bodhicaka, one thousand Buddhas.

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:44.020
 And in this universe, there's a big lake, big lake.

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:51.020
 And there is so many lotus, beautiful, unbelievable lotus blooming.

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:54.020
 And then there is only one lotus.

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:57.020
 It's one white lotus, one white lotus.

00:12:57.020 --> 00:13:02.020
 And the Divine, so God, says, oh, how wonderful, beautiful, look at so many beautiful lotus.

00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:05.020
 But there is only one white lotus.

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:08.020
 Why is that? Why is that?

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:19.020
 And then Buddhas said, all those red lotus represent all rest of the 999,000 Buddhas.

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:26.020
 Maybe not called it, 989 Buddhas.

00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:34.020
 But one lotus white is referring to the poor Buddha, the Buddha Shakyamuni.

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:38.020
 That's why the Buddha Shakyamuni is praising.

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:42.020
 Because the Buddha Shakyamuni see, the Buddhas all see the future.

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:45.020
 The one Buddha predicted how the future will be.

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:49.020
 When you reach enlightenment, maybe you become a Buddha.

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:54.020
 Buddha and what this real land will be, this and that, that.

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:56.020
 That, they all pray good things.

00:13:56.020 --> 00:14:04.020
 And in one era, it's so difficult, hard to subdue, hard to tame the mind of sentient beings.

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:10.020
 That era is called pre-degenerated world, world.

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:17.020
 And five, I'm not going to list it or trying to find out, but you can look in the books.

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:20.020
 And particularly you can look in the Googles.

00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:27.020
 So you look, there's five, the five degenerations, five degenerations.

00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:34.020
 This Buddha Shakyamuni era is the degeneration of the five, five degeneration.

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:41.020
 Their idea is so difficult to tame because their belief is so strong.

00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:44.020
 Their desire to spend is also short.

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:48.020
 And the emotion is so rough, rough, rough, too difficult.

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:56.020
 And all the 999 Buddhas are kind of ignored and take all the other few hundred errors.

00:14:56.020 --> 00:15:00.020
 But Buddha Shakyamuni is the one who said, "I will take that.

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:03.020
 I will become the Buddha at that time."

00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:06.020
 And the Gratian teacher becomes the Buddha.

00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:11.020
 Buddha and death are called, therefore it's called prison as white lovers.

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:15.020
 White lovers, this is the aspiration. It's so important.

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:20.020
 Again, we all should really remember that every hour we get the aspiration.

00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:23.020
 So, so important, so powerful.

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:28.020
 And all the Buddhas, the bodhisattvas, when you look, you read life story in the TK,

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:32.020
 they're going to be enlightened because they are aspirations.

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:38.020
 With the aspiration, and then they walk in spiramitas with two accumulated turmeric.

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:41.020
 So that's how this all is important.

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:46.020
 Then with those visual motivations, and then, as we acknowledge,

00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:51.020
 is then the purity, the understanding, or realization of the three guys.
