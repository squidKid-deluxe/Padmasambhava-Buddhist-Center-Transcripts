00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.400
 The body of the teachings. And that has, again, the fourth piece is the place of the homage.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:21.600
 Homage is what? Homage. And that is in English. It is translated.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:44.400
 "To the supreme, presiding, master of all Buddhas, families, all the families, and mandalas,

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:59.000
 and to the Sugata, Sugata Garva, I bow with undivided pay." So that is the place of homage.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 So now we go to these meanings. This place is a very traditional in Buddhism. Buddhism.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 And every one of those great masters, when they write or compose teachings, always they give praise

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000
.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.710
 Because the one in the teaching said, "What does that mean? Why do they do that?" Because they are

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.000
 honoring to the source of these teachings.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 These are the lineage teachings. Everyone is relieved, goes to the lineage, comes from Buddha.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:50.220
 Buddha Shakyamuni, who came 600 years ago. So therefore, one way or the other, or any different

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.000
 maybe poems,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 but they always praise to the lineage, to the Buddhas. Or Buddha Dharma Sangha.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.370
 And that also, according to the teaching, that tells that the writers or the who were given

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:11.000
 teaching is also very humble

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:21.960
 and also lined up to the lineage. And also, in that, indicating that the writer or the teacher is

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.000
 always going to keep the lineage teaching authentic.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:35.360
 So therefore, that teaching is not quite authentic. And by doing that, also in the teaching said,

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.000
 it will accommodate the manliness.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.740
 And according to the Buddha's teaching, in order to get enlightenment, in order to discover our

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.000
 Buddha nature, our own Buddha nature,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 nature, from the midst of the duality, we need power of the merit.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 Those merits are called verse to merit and accumulation merit, as you all know.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 So by doing this praise, we will accommodate the manliness. Verse to merit, accumulation merit.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:17.300
 Also, by that, according to the teaching, it will also remove the obstacles, at least remove the

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.000
 obstacle to compose that teaching,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.930
 if they write something. And it will also bring the fulfillment, and also it will establish the

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.000
 foundation of it going to benefit others.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.800
 Because in Buddhism, when they write something, according to the teaching, everything is best upon

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.000
 the completion,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:51.130
 to benefit to the oils, or to benefit one's own self, own self, self, to benefit one's own self, to

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.000
 benefit the other's own self.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 So therefore, it will create all those kind of clay passage, pathway, to follow all those goals,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 and to the praise.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 But this time, praise is to who? You say it as you see it.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 Datta naga dangaro, or what?

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 Shunga dangaro, shunga dangaro, that is what praise is.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:31.190
 And so here, what is it? If you think carefully, think about it, and say that the Supreme Presiding

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.000
 Master of all the family and mandala,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 who is that?

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 He is not really praising particularly Buddha Shakyamuni's names, but Shunga dangaro.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 Shunga dangaro is Supreme Lord of the families, and as well as all the mandalas.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 That is what is praising. So who is that Shunga dangaro?

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:14.780
 And of course, Shunga dangaro can be as good as some of the others, or the absolute dharmakaya

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.000
 state of the Buddha Shakyamuni's.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 But what is Shunga dangaro? Of course, you all know.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.710
 Many of you, we all know of it. I know a little bit, you know a little bit, maybe, or you know more

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:27.000
.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 No kidding. I'm not saying this is really coming. Yo, nothing.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 But I'm going to, anyway, if you know more, I'm going to tell a little bit about this.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 Shunga dangaro is the nature of our mind.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 And this Shunga dangaro is, in Tibet, what is the name?

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 Shunga dangaro, exactly that translated into Tibet by each of those great oscillators.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 Shunga dangaro, they were here.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 Shunga dangaro means what?

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 Shunga dangaro means beautiful.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 Shunga dangaro means gone.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 And Shunga dangaro means essence.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 So essence of the beautiful gone, in a way.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 That, what is that? Shunga dangaro is our nature.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 Shunga dangaro means perfect, perfect.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 Shunga dangaro is gone.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 Shunga dangaro, Shunga dangaro, Shunga dangaro, Shunga dangaro, Shunga dangaro, Shunga dangaro, and

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 Buddha's way.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:59.150
 But that Shunga dangaro, Shunga dangaro, Shunga dangaro, Shunga dangaro, Shunga dangaro, Shunga d

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:01.200
angaro, Shunga dangaro, Shunga dangaro, Shunga dangaro, Shunga dangaro, Shunga dangaro, Shunga dang

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.000
aro, Shunga dangaro, Shunga dangaro, Shunga dangaro, and Buddha's way.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 That is Shungata, and that Garbha means what? Essence.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 So that is essence of our nature will go beautifully.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 And we really follow with these directions of every accord with that.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 That is the meaning, world meaning of the Shungata Garbha.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 Then it has different meaning. I mean sin one, so many sin one means.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.000
 This is the really hard essence according to Mahayana, Shuttar Mahayana.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 According to Mahayana, this is the hard essence of the Buddha teachings.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 Buddha teachings.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
 It has a name, known as also Dattanga dangarbha.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 They have been here for a young boy a little bit.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000
 Same thing, Dattanga dangarbha, Shunga dangarbha.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 And also it has a name, Dharmadhatu.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 This is the Hindu name of Dharmadhatu.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 Also it has a name such as Dharmakaya.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 All this also has a known name as the original nature of the mind, nyumasi.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 All it has a name in the Dzogki teachings.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:27.000
 The teacher always said, "Southbound Muslims" or "Southbound Everness".

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 And then sometimes also it has a name, or not sometimes it says no name.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 It has both of each other.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 This has so many names, even it has so many names, but it refers to the same thing.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 Same thing to our own nature.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 And of course you all know that, why I am saying our own nature.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 According to the British teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni, we all inherited this nature.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 No one is out of this nature, ever as long as there are 17 beings.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 17 beings, or living beings.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 Every living beings, regardless of whatever karmic situation they are going through,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:20.000
 but no one is out of this nature.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:26.000
 To every living being, from the hill rims to the god's rims,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
 everyone has same nature, same qualities.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 It's not just same nature, it's one nature.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000
 Each of us has unique their own natures.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 Each of us, as a master seed, has oil.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 It's not just one oil, everyone's.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
 Each of seed has oil.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 Same way, each of us living beings inherited the enlightenment, the promising nature.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 The potential is exactly right with us.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:14.000
 This nature is in a teaching seed, it's never diluted in samsara,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 or never devaluted where we are going through many different situations, karmas,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:29.000
 never changed, never devaluted, not become bad.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 And when we are going to get enlightenment, it's not going to improve anything.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:45.000
 It's always, and for that reason, and what in the great city of Buddha said,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 this tatagata garbai is old and natural, always it's like that.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 Nothing really changed.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:03.000
 So this is the nature that we all inhale.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 And this is then, as I said, in Mahayana teaching, Mahayana teaching is taught

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000
 so clearly by gracious teacher, Buddha Shatamundi.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
 In the teaching, great master Mahamrammaji,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:25.000
 he said that great teachings of Mahayana teachings are known as two teachings,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
 first, second training well of dharma, and third training well of dharma.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 Second training well of dharma is teaching mainly on the Pandya Paramata.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 Pandya Paramata teaching is what you all know.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:53.000
 The teachings from the poem, the poem I will get all the way to enlightenment state is emptiness.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:12:01.000
 So that means Buddha teach is, everything is emptiness.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:07.000
 From the poem, that means from poem aggregates,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 feeling aggregates, perceptual aggregates,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 conceptual aggregates, consciousness aggregates,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:27.000
 and all the path and all the movement enlightenment is emptiness state.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 And what about this tathanga dharma, what Buddha taught?

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 That great master Mahamrammaji said, this tathanga dharma, this nature,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:50.000
 tathanga dharma or the sun gatang dharma has naturally college of the emptiness.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 Therefore in the Dzogki teaching said, nature is emptiness.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:13.000
 And I mean, is it, is it more in the Tibetan world?

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
 I'm sure many of you know Tibetan.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
 More than what?

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
 Natural is empty.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
 Rambi is sour.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
 Again, Rambi is display.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:32.000
 Maybe I talk about display. Display is clarity.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 And the tukki koncha, the energy is pervasive, all pervasive.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
 That is what tathanga dharma is.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 Nature is emptiness.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 And energy maybe, I talk about energy.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 Energy is clarity.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 And then, and union is pervasive.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
 I'm talking about it, but in the Tibetan world,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000
 Mowatungpa, Rambi is sour, tukki koncha.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 You, many of you know that.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000
 That is what it is.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 So great master Mahamrammaji taught, and as well as Mungkimpa said,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:30.000
 in the Pandya Paramata teaching, Buddha explored,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 explained, explored the emptiness aspect of this tathanga dharma.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 Athanga dharma in this way.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
 Buddha explained, "So why?"

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:49.000
 Because this emptiness teaching is directly antidote

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 of the grasping, clinging.
