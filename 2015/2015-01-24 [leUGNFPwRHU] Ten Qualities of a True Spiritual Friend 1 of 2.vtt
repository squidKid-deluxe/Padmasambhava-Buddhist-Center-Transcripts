00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.500
 You find, again, a noble son, noble daughter, a contract qualified spiritual friend.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:12.000
 When you find that qualified student, a qualified spiritual friend,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 contract, associate, be together, explore the good things so that you can develop.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 As that good spiritual, qualified, inherited, or has, that is whole idea.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 So therefore, again, talking about the qualifications,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 and there is so many qualifications in the Buddha teaching explained, very detailed, etc.,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 thorough, though, applying the different aspects of the Buddha teaching.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.500
 But I mentioned, generally, kind of understanding of the basic Buddhism qualification of the

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.000
 spiritual friend,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 and in particular, the basic qualification of the spiritual friend of the Mahayana.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.280
 And today, I will talk really about the qualification of the spiritual friend or the Mahayana

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.000
 teacher, of the Mahayana teachers.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 And this is according, again, to the great master, longchenpa.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 So, of course, there is many things, but this is something that will teach you,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 or guide you, or support you, in helping practice place, practice place.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 Those are what we say.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.780
 So, I will list those things, those items or the numbers, and then I will go here to bring you all

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.000
 those things.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 And the first level is, that spiritual friend, one who received the empowerment,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 or who has the empowerment, received that Mahayana teacher's empowerment,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 and also may stay with the Samayas, received empowerment, keeping the Samayas.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 And that, individually, is very gentle, very gentle.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 And then, I am just going to list those.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:12.860
 And the next one is, that individually, has also knowledge of the entirely generally Mahayana Buddh

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.000
ists.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 And that, individually, is also practicing, meditating, getting some degree of realization.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 Because of that, also, that individually is so gentle, so tamed mind, that individually is tamed,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 very tamed.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 And that, individually, is also so compassionate.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 Therefore, again, also helping to other beings, all the times.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 That, individually, or that spiritual friend, is also not called with the samsara-posit activities.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:14.320
 And always engaging, supporting, encouraging practices, or, I mean, this one, that individual's

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.000
 heart.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 Heart, head, hand, or hands.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 And that, individually, is also very kind of understanding of the phenomena, these external things.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 Such as, for renunciations, understand of the empowerment, understand of the cause and the effect.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 The system, law of the karmas, and the samsara-naturals.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 Naturals, all this, so very kind of understanding of the samsara-posit activities.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 And very ready to support to the others, help to the others.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 And that, individually, has also a lot of skillful means, a lot of spiritual skillful means.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 And that, individually, also has lineage blessings, lineage blessings.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 So, those are the great marks of mankind, by listening to them.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:18.620
 The one who really qualified the spiritual friend, who can teach you to ask, lead, and usher into

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.000
 the path to practice lineage.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 And here he added that, if you find that spiritual friend,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 that will help to fulfill the accomplishment of the Siddhas.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 And will bring, accomplish in the Siddhas.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 So, those are the mists of the practice, these are.
