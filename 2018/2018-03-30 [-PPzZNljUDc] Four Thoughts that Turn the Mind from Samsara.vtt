00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.320
 And what are those? And also it is called mindfulness. All the mindfulness, all train of the mind,

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.600
 is mindfulness.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:17.340
 We make it more closely connected to the way things are, not carried by the force of our kind of

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.000
 like mundane thought.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 It will become more closely connected to the way things are.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 And then you are looking totally with the way things are, and observing.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 And when we do this, then what it does? It becomes more practical, more sensible, more sensible.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 And then it will also do that for ourselves, more common senses.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.290
 More words, that means more words don't shine, not become wild, kind of like, no kind of practical

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:48.000
 things.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 So it will completely become so sad. And that is the core training of the mind.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 And what is the process taking on, again, our beautiful lives, British lives?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 Second is, reflecting our mind on our British lives. Reflecting mind on impermanence.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 Reflecting mind on cause and result or effort in evidence.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 And the reflect in the samsara, in this world, has like challenges and difficulties.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 Challenges, unstable things in this world. You are reflecting your mind to death.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 This is, as I say, it is known as also poor kind of mindfulness practices.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 And the precious life is that, again, life is so precious.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 Each of our lives and every one's life is so precious.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 So sweet, so beautiful, precious.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 This precious life is regardless of what time we've got this. It's not just, okay, go accidentally.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 It has so many beautiful calls and condemnations.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 I'm just talking, I really believe in that. But you can read this, though.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 Many books, really, it's true. Not talking stories of the petty tales

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 or not talking of the story of someone else.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 It's talking of empathy, the way things are in this world, what we have.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 It's true, practical, Western world, looking to God, to kind of appreciating and reflecting that.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 That's what it is. Really, life is so precious.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 This life is not just happened by itself.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 It has a lot of beautiful calls and condemnations, poor to life, this beautiful life.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 And feel happy in the joy. How wonderful, how thankful.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 It's, again, another form of joy and appreciation.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 When we have this opportunity, beautiful life, it's not going to stay forever.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 Again, this is not here in the kind of a tracking story to that.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 But true, it is not going to stay forever.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 No. Also, it's changing every time. Every time. Every time changing.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:20.420
 So, therefore, have some courage, some commitment that I'm going to use this life something

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.000
 beautiful.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 Thinking of that is known as impermanent.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 It takes a reflection that impermanent.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 And it's like impervious. React is a pridal. It's not permanent. It's changing. Continues changing.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 Changing one after another.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 And there are varieties of all the uncertain things that can come.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 This spiritual life can be spoiled.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.500
 And while we have part of beautiful life, beautiful thing, we should do something for beautiful

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.000
 benefit, beautiful qualities.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 Which, then, that's known as we're making wise ourselves, more practical ourselves.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 Thinking, using time and opportunity to do this.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 So, thank you for laughing at the impermanent.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 Impermanent also during me is bad.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 Because impermanent is bad, good, because we can make a change.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 Because impermanent, that's why we are here.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 If there's no impermanent, we won't be like what we are now.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 And also if one underneath, it will not going to happen. Is that what we are?

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 Everyone won't see like that. It will change.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 So, life is precious, opportunity is precious, but it is not going to stay forever.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 And therefore, take the opportunity.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 And back this time, something worthwhile and special, something meaningful.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 For my son, to my family, my friends, to everyone.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 And for my future.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 And in the Buddha's teaching, for Buddhism, life is not just ended here, ended here.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 It will continue the next month.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 Whatever we do now, we will reflect in the future.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 What we are now is known as result of the past or past lives.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 So, when thinking of what we are now, now what we are, that way, our past is not bad.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 We must do good at all the Buddhism.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 Really good. It's a logic.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 Logic, it is because look into us, even though we don't see the past alive in the past,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 but look into ourselves.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 Oh, we did quite okay, quite good in past, because I'm quite good.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 I'm happy now. I'm like good.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 And what we are activating, what we are doing now,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 when we reflect that result in the future, of course, this time,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 what we do now will reflect the result also to now, too, a little bit.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 But the biggest one, according to Buddhism, it will reflect in the future, in the next lifetime.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 So, therefore, everyone has to have the future bright.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 Future is unknown for us.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 We don't see the future.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 But definitely the future will be there.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 Because even though we don't see it yet in 2020,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:24.000
 we don't see it yet in 2025, '20, '20, '30, '30, yet in 2020, all of that,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 but even we don't see that when we did, it will come.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 It will come.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 Similarly, even we don't see our future lives,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 but they will be future lives according to Buddhism.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 It's not a word to end.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 So, whatever we do there, it really will reflect all,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 which is it.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 And therefore, when we do the good activities now,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 that will reflect all the future, future will be bright.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 So, therefore, this time, this prison time is so great,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 so important to do good things for us, to others, to everyone.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 That's what we think of these eight boundaries.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 And then cause and effort are inevitable.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 Cause and effort are inevitable in a short term and in long terms.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 All that, whatever we do in a short time, whatever good activity we do,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 that also will bring the result the same way.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 It will blend with the flow in our garden in a short time, it will bring flowers.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 If we continue to take care of that, it will bring flowers.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.000
 If we didn't blend the flow in our garden, and it won't bring flowers.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 It will be the same logic, simple logic, but it will be true.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 It really will reflect.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 And then according to the Buddha's teaching, according to the Buddhism,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 whatever the activity we do, partly related to our strong emotions,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 strong emotions such as positive emotions, negative emotions,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 whatever activity we do there,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 that will reflect the result some really immediately,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 but the biggest result will reflect in the future lives.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 That's according to the teacher.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 It will reflect.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 Therefore, if anything that will be good activity with positive,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 strong positive mind, then it will be really good for the future.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
 And that was known as in Buddhism, dharma.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 That many of you know all dharma means something that activity we did did.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 dharma is not coming from outside, it's our own days.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 As we were through many times, the teachings.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 The teachings and you know that.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 So it's all our activities.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 It's all our activities.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 So therefore, every kind of activity we can be very thoughtful,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 and we can be very careful,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 and reflecting our mind to our every action.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 That is known as also mindfulness.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
 Our activities are guided by mindfulness and alertness,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000
 and more thoughtful, then it's really its own practice.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000
 It's mindfulness.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
 It's all mindfulness.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
 We don't have that.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
 That means mindfulness means wisdom.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 It's guided by our activities, by wisdom,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:20.000
 which is very beautiful and very special.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
 So those are known as breathing.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 We karma.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
 Or let me call it effortless mind.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 And then reflecting mind in the samsara, in this world.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000
 This samsara world has a lot of challenges,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 a lot of differences, a lot of uncertainties.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 That is always being like that.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 That's the old samsara or the old world.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 So therefore, we can strong ourselves.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 Strong ourselves, really.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 Trying to strengthen ourselves in the courage,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
 in the commitment, do good things.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
 And be courageous, be strong.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
 And we then understand it,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
 and also use our time for the beautiful purpose,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 to benefit ourselves, all the things.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
 So samsara has a challenge,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 samsara has a difficulty, and that.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 Even though difficulty is also not just bad,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
 it has always been solved.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 It always has meanings.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
 It's not just happening itself.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
 It has always meanings.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 Even sometimes bad things happen, it looks like happening.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 But from that, we can learn.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
 We can become even more stronger, more wisdom.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
 More gain can gain from the difficult times.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
 Even it looks like very difficult.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
 And that really happens.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
 And so many great masters, those enlightened beings,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 they experience a lot of difficulties,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 a lot of challenges one after another.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
 But those challenges are difficulties

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 that make them as their great enlightened beings, after that.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 We keep the courage in the commitment.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 So challenges are not always bad,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
 but yet there's a lot of challenges and difficulties.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000
 So those are known as poor training of the mind,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 or poor renunciation, and which is obvious

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 is good to reflect in those minds, on those meanings,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
 every time when you practice this.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
 Again, of course, I mentioned that a lot,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 that in the details you can find in the book.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 But when you reflect in that simple way,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
 what it is, British life,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000
 the impermanent cause and effort are inevitable,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:44.000
 and samsara has difficult, or the world has uncertain.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
 Kind of prepare ourselves to have that poor.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000
 Poor is known as poor training of the mind.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
 What it does, I say so many times,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
 it will soften our mind.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 We become more sensible.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 We become more practical.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 It will connect ourselves to the nature.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 It will connect by this.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 And this is also, according to the teaching,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 for the Lord of the greatest teacher,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000
 Buddha Shakyamuni, gave the thoughts in his teaching,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000
 what is it called?

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 Poor, noble, true teachings.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
 So this poor renunciation of thought

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 is both his true, true teachings,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
 such as suffering true, cause of suffering true.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 That is basic, his false, true teachings.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 Now, once we have the depth, understanding,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
 beautifully of this, this suffering true,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
 the cause of suffering true,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 then we follow the path.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
 Any path is practice, path of truth.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
 When you follow the path of truth,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 then when it comes, it will come,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 then the cessation of truth, according to the point of truth.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 That is achievement and a result,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 result, cessation of truth.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 So now we begin the practices.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 When you come to the practice,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 there is the effort.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
 If you are talking at the mindral level, mindral level,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 then we practice it.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
 There are six different practices.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
 That I will again go into.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 Many of you know already, but many of you don't know.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000
 I like to just highlight a lot of the six different practices.
