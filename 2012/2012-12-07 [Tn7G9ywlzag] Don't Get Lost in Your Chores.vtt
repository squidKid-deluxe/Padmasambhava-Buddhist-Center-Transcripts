00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.560
 "Good activities. Smaller good activities we should enjoy. Appreciate the good and increase

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:18.560
 our joy in devotion. Or may I have to do even more than what I did in one country. Highlight

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.120
 of those things. So therefore, again, this is all the teachings of the Karma for a short

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:31.360
 time. For example, here, here, and one or another, and all that. And then again, all

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:37.400
 these upgrade great master mentioned about the Karma, then again he highlight of this

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:45.360
 impermanent, that life is precious, life is impermanent, and it is important that we should

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.960
 really accept full advantage of this life. While we have the opportunity, everything

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:59.160
 in our favor, and we should make this beautiful. And then life is, so even though there's so

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.960
 many chores, many things to do that, and we always think, oh, I have to do this, chores,

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:11.920
 I have to do that, after that, I'm going to do this. But that, so many people had those

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.280
 thoughts and couldn't do anything for themselves and have to leave suddenly. And that could

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:24.080
 happen to us too. So therefore, time is precious, situation is precious, be practical, be wise,

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:30.680
 and do good, good things. And every, this is again, in his great master said, and Buddha

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.960
 said to you in the teaching, I mean, Buddha had to say, thinking of the impermanent is

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:42.440
 so important. It makes ourself, as I said many times, it makes our heart soft and more practical.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:48.200
 We can take really more desperation lives, more nice way, so won't spoil. Here, great

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.600
 master said, at least think three times that everything is impermanent. My father used,

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.760
 I think I told you that, he put small kind of writing, writing his own head, writing,

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.640
 put it right on the, on the surface of his chest board. He have small, I think, not small,

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:13.520
 it's a big chest ball, right? Covered, covered, you put that, he glued there, he glued there,

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:20.440
 life is impermanent, don't waste, trying to not waste, I mean, don't waste, he really

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.480
 wrote that. And great master here said, at least think of this impermanent three times

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.600
 a day, three times a day. If you think three times a day, it makes soft and hard, as he

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:39.320
 said many times, it makes more practical. And that is really teaching us on the impermanent

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:47.680
 and causing the inevitable, as well as samsara as poor trouble. And this is then the poor

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.000
 renounce session. So highlight this condensed way, this is the teaching on the poor renounce

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:00.480
 session, all poor kind that reverse the mind, our mind from the attack. And this is also

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:09.400
 one way we're doing this is a very organic way, what we're doing, we're detoxicating.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:17.080
 We're detoxicating our attachment, our grasping, very organic way, so that we can prepare next

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:27.160
 to our session. So that really goes deeper and more powerful to change our life and our

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:34.120
 practice and good things. So that is my britos, it's already 12 and now I told you that maybe

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.880
 you have some questions, maybe you'll discuss. Or if you'd like to hold back that tomorrow.
