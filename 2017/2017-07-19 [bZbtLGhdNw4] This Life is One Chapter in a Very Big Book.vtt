00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.080
 And this is of course, you all know, Vadiyana teaching. This is the Vadiyana teaching, which is the

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:15.000
 Buddha Shatyamani Sri, the highest teaching, teaching among all His teachings, highest.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:26.030
 And the one that actually means highest, highest bell or famous teaching, reality, it means because

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.000
 this teaching will connect to the enlightenment of true nature,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 exactly as it is directly, right now, to direct that. And therefore, it's called highest teaching

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 or more direct, more swept teachings, directed things.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.840
 And that goes, what that means also then, this is like the lower teaching or the basic Buddhism

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.000
 teaching won't connect to the enlightenment.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.770
 Yes, it will connect to the enlightenment, but it will take little longer, little longer and it

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.000
 takes time.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 But Vadiyana teaching is directed for those reasons. Vadiyana teaching has full of skillful means,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 not just a wonderful skillful means,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.070
 a lot of skillful means to discover this nature. And then at the same time, it has a lot of

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:25.000
 techniques, methods, and the sutra won't have exactly all that.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 And then, because since you're using a lot of skillful means and a lot of beautiful techniques,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 also you don't have too much hardships, difficulties that you have to do.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 And therefore, Vadiyana teaching is all those reasons known as highest teaching or direct teaching.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 And again, that means it connects directly to the nature of where things are.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 Nature of where things are, I said the other day, and many of you know, is all enlightened status,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 reality level, everything is enlightened status.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.980
 Vadiyana teaching pointed out three gradual status. Many of you heard these things, and include

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.000
 myself, I heard that too.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.270
 And also, Inazoka teaching is all three highest status. And many times, we had all these great

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.000
 blessings from the states.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:27.510
 Reality, yes, it is all true, exactly as it is according to the teaching of the Buddha. But the

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.000
 first time, we don't see that.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:43.120
 Why? Because of habit pattern. Habit pattern blockage that we created by our own mind. Nobody

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:51.000
 forced us, nobody forced us, nobody said that to do, but by ourselves.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 We created such immense heaviness, thickness of the habit pattern, that blood.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.400
 When we start this blockage of the habit pattern, that's what, again, the great teaching says, from

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.000
 the biggest time, the biggest time.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:20.710
 Our life here is not just the beginning, our life is not the last, and also our life is not just

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.000
 the end.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 It is continuation according to Buddhism. Life goes on and on, like turning a page, turning a page.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:40.510
 Every line is like chapters. A chapter goes on and on. Our book of our life is big, big, big

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.000
 chapters.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 One happen, a page is continually turning, and a chapter is continually merging to the next.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:56.710
 We created all that habit patterns, whatever we did, in our self-confidence storehouse, or our

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:02.000
 mental status, or our mental, what's called, eye-clothes.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:10.860
 And to eye-clothes, we kept every hour deeds and activities in that status. We kept that. It's not

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.000
 going to end easy.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 That is known as habit patterns. That's God.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:24.290
 In habit patterns, present time, we are habit patterns that are saturated by the grasping, clean

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:25.000
ings.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 There is good habit patterns and unnecessary, unhealthy habit patterns.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:41.300
 We are more lined with unnecessary, unhealthy habit patterns because of the unhealthy ego-cling

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.000
 activities.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 Ego-clinging becomes our boss, ruling our whole environment of the mental status.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 As I said the other day, ego-clinging is a self-distant attitude of the mental status.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:08.400
 It is emotion, it is darkness, ignorance, it is prayerful, it is arrogance, and then it has all

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.000
 those poisons combined with this.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:18.680
 And when that merge, when that begins to act, it always acts as unhealthy things, unhealthy things

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.000
 most of the time.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 That habit pattern is fired upon up and up.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.380
 And so now our practice, our operations teacher, Buddha pointed out with the techniques and the

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:31.000
 skill to me,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 method and all, in particular vedayana, we follow the teachings, we follow the instructions.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.350
 This instruction is also not something that we have to do, strange things or something different

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:43.000
 things.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 We just apply what we have already equipped ourselves.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 We have revealed all the tools and techniques as Buddha pointed out.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:01.360
 That is then known as, which will begin with our practice, as I always said and other great masters

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.000
 say too.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 I am just following humbly with all those great masters what they say.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 Bring more joy and appreciation. Joy and appreciation is the tools of the two.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:21.470
 Despair, that darkness of the ignorance and how this ego cleans, joy and appreciation of the good

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:22.000
 things.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.480
 We are not joy and appreciation of the ego's activity, but we are joy and appreciation of our real

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:28.000
 college,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 of the true nature and oppressionism.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:37.440
 So bring up joy and appreciation as a seedling qualities, seedling qualities, freshness qualities,

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.000
 joy and appreciation.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 We have so many reasons, you know, we are all very highly intelligent beings.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
 Beings and staff, students, started animals, so many high duties, educated person.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 You know we have so many reasons to bring up joy and appreciation.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 As I said the other day, joy and appreciation is not with deterring from the dharma practices.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 That is very foundation of the dharma, dharma, joy and appreciation.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 Seedling qualities, then bring up more compassion which is also known as bodhicam.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 Really bring up seedling, fresh compassion.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 And then bring more purity, understanding and with devotion.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:32.420
 We have the seedling energy of joy and appreciation, compassion and purity, understanding and

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:34.000
 devotion.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 Truly we are great practitioners.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 Realization will dawn immediately or soon.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 Not going to stop in so many years, up in the dawns and ups in the dawns.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 All that really will come. So easy. That is guaranteed.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 Guaranteed what called? Guaranteed? Money back.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:04.260
 And we have the seedling knowledge of the devotion and joy and appreciation and freshness, deep

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:10.000
 compassion and purity, understanding or even devotion.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 The realization is right in our hand. Your hand and my hand.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 Why our realization and progress of dharma is taking so long sometimes.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 It tells our joy and appreciation.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 Devotions in both each other are not so active.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 They are called sleeping beauties.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 They are sleeping. Let that rise up. That is really.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 If we have that, then we are great practitioners.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 Otherwise if we do practice dharma, chanting, meditation, whatever,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
 all these almost become kind of intellectuals.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 Dry. Dry.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 But when you have that, truly it is freshening, it is reactivating, it is pure, it is rewarding,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 it is competence where confidence is more than confidence.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 It is really brings such a perfectly beautiful goal that what we all look at.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
 So that is what with joy and appreciation.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 With joy those all important.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
 With this those which were taught and then we begin to practice such as this.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 Friends, now.
