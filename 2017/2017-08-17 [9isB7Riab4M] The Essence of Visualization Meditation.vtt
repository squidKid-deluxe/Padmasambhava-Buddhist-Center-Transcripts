00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.670
 We read the body as well as also speak it to you, but always there is three central columns of the

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.500
 visualizations, and many of you know that.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:19.000
 And those are known as clarity, purity, and stabilization.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:29.140
 These three are the central columns to keep up the quality, authenticity of the visualization

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.000
 meditation.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:43.340
 And the first one is clarity, clarity, clarity, or clarity. That means trying to keep up every

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.000
 detail of the visualization of the particle this time, Dorje Drolo.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.660
 Dorje Drolo visualizations, every detail is there. And to break that visualization, what any

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:01.000
 teaching says, look to the good Thampas, very good Thampas.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:09.590
 Or put yourself, put your cards, cards of Dorje Drolo, stare into that Dorje Drolo, put that right

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:16.000
 in front of your table and stare into that, for maybe one minute or whatever.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 And after that close eye, close eye and see how that is clear.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.990
 And also when you look and particularly look staring to the face of Dorje Drolo, staring to the

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.000
 face of that, trying to break the clear image of the face first.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 When that comes, quite clearly, then to the part of the body and kind of focus more on the body.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.070
 When that comes, now the head and the body come quite clearly and now look kind of concentrated, I

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.000
 think the same way staring to the like throne of the Dorje Drolo.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.460
 That which means Tigris and all that, look into that. And then again look to all everything and

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.000
 stare for a minute or not a second or whatever you can do.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 A corner in there and close eye and see this, this, staring there.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:21.540
 And that is what is known as, that will help to bring the clarification, clarity of the visual

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.000
izations.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 This is not just a Dorje Drolo, any deity, any Buddha can really do that.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 That's the way, the authentic, good, thanga or the putjaka look to that.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 So that is really about the clarity, clarity.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 And then second is the purity.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.470
 Purity means, this Dorje Drolo, what we visualize looks like, I mean of course it appears as very r

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.000
uffled, peaceful and very kind of like,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 it looks like I mean even we use word as angry kind of all that.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 It's thought, as we say it. Dorje Drolo started with this original thing, started, come from clear,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 emptiness, blessfulness.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 That is what is it, it's a compassion, loving kindness, wisdom, that combined into a very disfones.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 Fones. So this is not just a kind of neurotic, kind of aggressive.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 And ego's notions that ego clearly made will think, think is nothing to do with that.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.630
 It's total beauty. What it does, it is immediately directly resubduing, knocking the head of the

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:41.000
 ego.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 Ego structure, demolishing the ego structure, bring the equanimity, understanding, realizations.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.970
 There for general whole visualization is known as the spatial antidote to immediately reduce the ha

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.000
bble patterns of the egos.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.460
 It is renowned, that's what the visualization is, knocking the habble, short patterns of the ego's

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:06.000
 meaning.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 At this time, then Dorje Drolo appeared with joy. So it's pure, it's pure and it's simple to tell.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.940
 Again another terminology in the Buddha teaching, it is a wisdom, it is a compassion, it is a

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.000
 loving kindness.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 That's it, all that. And whole displays in that. So bring that realization.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 When we don't meditate Dorje Drolo, we don't have, don't feel the emotions.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:41.300
 The anger, anger, this and that thing. Bring more calm, peace and joy, more appreciation, more

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.000
 relaxed, more openness.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 That's what, again, we went yesterday, nine moods.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 What is the three moods of the heart, of the mind of Dorje Drolo?

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 Go on, compassion and peace and profound vastness, that is what the Dorje Drolo is.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:12.940
 So bring that knowledge, that and not delude by the egos and with emotion, subject and object and

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.000
 all of that.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 Everything is a purity state, purity state. So that is really about purity.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 So clear purities.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 Then third one is a stabilization. Stable. Stable means good, concentrated meditations.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 Stable. That means, again, that means to keep up that.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 One in the Vajrayana teaching, you see. Vajraya pride. Vajraya pride. Vajraya pride.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 Vajraya pride means we, you are going to feel 100% Dorje Drolo.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:08.060
 You are 100% Dorje Drolo. I have meditated. We are not going to think, I am kind of pretending as

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.000
 Dorje Drolo.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 Or I try to Dorje Drolo. Those are the ego tricks. Those are the habit patterns of the dualities.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 It is undermining the quality of our meditation.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 Be in that state with confidence, with fearlessness.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 Fearlessness. And we have the Vajraya pride.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 That means, our Buddha nature, your Buddha nature, my Buddha nature, everyone's Buddha nature,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 is the same Buddha nature with the Buddha kyatyamuni and the GURUPYAMASAMU.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 There is no difference at all in the teaching state.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 As it is, being in that state, why have to be timid to be there?

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 I am not pretending this and that. These are ego tricks.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 This time we have to maintain full that I am that state.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 100% the one. That state. We Dorje Drolo's state. So that is known as stability.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 These three are the central column, or the essential column of the visualizations, meditations.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 So that we have that understanding.
