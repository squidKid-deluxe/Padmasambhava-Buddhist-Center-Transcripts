00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.960
 Okay. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Okay. Thank you. Welcome, everyone. Thank you very much.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:14.800
 And also, Happy New Year to everyone. Thank you. Happy New Year, I wish and pray. We all pray this

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:24.800
 2025 will be very nice and beautiful. Happy New Year. Really wish that we wish that this world

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:32.960
 will become very peaceful. Peaceful world of the old elements, peace world of all the human beings,

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:41.920
 and peaceful ourself, each of ourself become more peace, more calm, more joy, more apprehensive,

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:49.920
 and less just the disturbance of the doubt and hesitation and skeptical standing family on the

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.800
 ground of our inner beautiful calling of love, kindness, compassion, and really wishing and

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:04.880
 pray, pray for this. Today we're gathering, it's called, to celebrating, to activating of this

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:14.720
 upcoming or to come, come like 2025, we really wish this one very beautiful. And for that reason,

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:22.080
 we do this praise. We dedicated this whole our practices for bring the peace, peace to the world,

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:30.400
 peace to the elements, peace to the human beings, all the sentient beings, and peaceful ourself.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:38.720
 We have more joy, more appreciation, more great, great thoughts, and more really thankful.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:46.960
 And the same time with more content and more relaxed, more calm. As I said, standing firmly

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:54.720
 on the ground of our inner goodness call it, whatever pad we have, but a brain of joy,

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:02.800
 peace, happiness, respect, and appreciation to your old beings. We follow the always with our own

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:09.920
 kind of emotion, ego clinging, self-important attitudes. We were not going to fulfill our goal

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.840
 of the joy and the peace. And then that kind of all these self-important things are completely

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:22.640
 involved with the skeptical, doubt, and hesitations, and kind of self-blaming to the others,

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:30.880
 blaming to one's own self. Kind of we go through this because that was called the activity of the

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:38.480
 ego, according Buddhism. And so therefore, we bring more joy, peace, happiness, and praise

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.640
 sincerely today. We're going to practice the praise to Murbha and Masambhava, Buddha Shakyamuni,

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:52.720
 gracious teacher Buddha Shakyamuni, and Tara, and with all the Dharma followers. Now all the angels

00:02:52.720 --> 00:03:00.160
 of the protractors and angels of the virtues of the universe, virtues, love, kindness, compassion,

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:06.960
 promote a joy and peace, and bring also courage and commitment and a determination to our heart

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:14.560
 and mind. So we stand firmly on the ground where we really belong and wishing and pray for that

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:21.360
 reason. So I'm very happy that we all had the opportunity to come together and in physical

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:29.840
 level or here or as well as in electrical or technology level. I'm very happy and thankful.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:36.320
 Again, happy New Year, everyone. Thank you. Thank you very much for participating. Thank you. Happy

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:44.080
 New Year, everyone. Happy New Year. Now we start with the practice of what's called the opening

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.960
 prayer booklet with the seven-line prayer. But first, we do three minutes of silence,

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:54.560
 meditation, subtle our mind, and very more calm and joy in appreciation. Really,

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.560
 feel more grounded ourself to our own beautiful nature.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:14.000

 Kondazamu pray is very famous Dzokhi teachings, really. It's a nugget teachings of the hour where

01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:06.000
 all things are started.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:20.000
 So, it is very powerful and special prayers and we go here, page, at the end of this page, colorful

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:20.000
.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:28.000
 We're going to chime and then we're going back to the beginning. Beginning, page, what? Page one.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:41.000
 Colorful is page 23. Yeah, page 23. Okay, we stand on our meditation and then we're going to chime

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:41.000
 this.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:49.260
 Here is said in the total the end of this at this time, visualize yourself the Kondazamu and then

01:20:49.260 --> 01:20:52.000
 decide to display that well-heared by everyone.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:59.140
 That's the visualization. If not, really again increasing both each other, extended both each other

01:20:59.140 --> 01:21:01.000
 and to every living beings.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:08.650
 So again, as we chime in praying this for all the beings, everyone in this today's special day of

01:21:08.650 --> 01:21:10.000
 the new year.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:13.000
 Yes, in the yah.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:21.980
 This das is here from Tantra which clearly shows the unimpeded realization of the Buddha Kondazamu

01:21:21.980 --> 01:21:24.000
 in a great profession.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:30.360
 This is the ninth chapter, the prayer that will lead the sentry beings to the enlightenment state

01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:32.000
 without even going.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:39.000
 So, all the appearance and the phenomena are the possibility of the samsara of the nirvana.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:43.000
 Have one soul for this all in two results.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:49.000
 The miracle of knowing and unknowing through these prayers of the Kondazamu.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:56.140
 May all beings is like the perfect enlightenment in the palace of the madhaka, the soul where

01:21:56.140 --> 01:21:58.000
 everything is uncomported.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:05.000
 Self arising, infinite, inconceivable beyond the level of samsara and nirvana.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:11.000
 Knowing this suchness is the Buddha who unknowing beings of wondrous, compressible.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:17.000
 May all beings of the three times like the nature of the inconceivable source.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:20.000
 Furthermore, I Kondazamu proclaim.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:24.000
 Sure, the soul is free from the cause and the condition.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:29.000
 The soul is realized by the serpentine rising awareness.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:34.000
 It is not named by the arrows exaggerating such as inside or inside.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:38.000
 This is not obscured by the darkness of the mindfulness system.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:42.000
 Therefore, there is no sense of the mystery of the perception.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:49.000
 Cult with this prayer is pursuing awareness and the three roles are living in the heaven.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:56.000
 Unaddicted to the five objects, the samsara of pleasure, self arising the awareness of the priest.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:04.000
 Solid form in the five borders, the radiative clarity of the awareness is unseasoned.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:11.350
 This simple nature is a five-bit wisdom. In action, the five-bit wisdom is the five primordial budd

01:23:11.350 --> 01:23:12.000
has.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:16.000
 When this wisdom expanded, political buddhas arrived.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:22.000
 The expression of the power of the five-fold wisdom during the 2016 Harigas.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:26.000
 Therefore, only awareness is never diluted.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:30.000
 I am the primordial buddha by my powerful prayer.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:36.000
 May all beings of the three realms of the samsara recognize the rising awareness

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:40.000
 and the expanding capacity of the great wisdom.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:46.000
 My emanations are conceiving. Inconceivable billions of the emanations are displayed.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:53.000
 Whatever the varieties are needed to help this enemy, by my powerful compassion and strength,

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:59.000
 may all beings of the three realms be liberated from the ways of the sixth essence.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:03.000
 In the beginning, the looking arises in the same way.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:09.000
 When the awareness of the soul is forgotten, the mind becomes numb and jealous.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:12.000
 This is the first ignorance, the cause of every else.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:19.000
 Instantly unconsciousness, one thought wondrous, endless, one sees the above on the floor.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:26.000
 The baggage I and the others print in, and through the clinging, it becomes habitual.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:32.000
 The sentencing comes from the samsara, and they increase in the effortlessly of the five-folders.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:36.000
 There is no end to the activity of the five-folders.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:42.000
 So the source of the delusion, the sending being, is numb, jealous, blind to the brain.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:46.000
 I am the Buddha, the power of my prayer.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:53.000
 May all beings clad in the human mind, release or cling, and recognize the self-evident.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:59.000
 Through the converged illnesses, one's consciousness is unburdened to the stats.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:04.000
 Through the constructive ignorance, one separates the seven others.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:11.000
 These two, the converged in the constructive ignorance, from best the sending being, completely.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:15.000
 I am the Buddha, my powerful prayer.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:20.000
 May all beings in the samsara, remove the dark covered in mindfulnessness,

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:26.000
 play a realistic lesson, and recognize self-evident.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:30.000
 Ulessly concerned with the odd genesis of the dark,

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:33.000
 which is developed from the subtle small attachments,

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:39.000
 into the power of a habit of pain, food, clothing, wealth, place and the convention.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:47.000
 The five desires are of a long relationship, being nurtured by the denialist object.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:50.000
 This is the darkness of the world.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:53.000
 This is no end to the dual-state activity.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:57.000
 The wrapped in a proof of attachment is the birth of the hungry gods.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:01.000
 The suffering and the power of the instant.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:05.000
 To be grown in the state of the hunger and the thirst is terrible.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:08.000
 I am the Buddha, my powerful prayer.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:12.000
 May all beings in conflict with them in attachment.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:17.000
 Neither reject desire, nor accept the sorrow.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:20.000
 A relaxing mind in its own state.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:25.000
 Original self-refreshing awareness, and relaxed discrimination.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:31.000
 When extending the room of a life, there are certain fears and tumbling,

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:38.000
 including the killing we develop in the habit of the patterns of the hate,

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:43.000
 increasing the power of attachment by enemies, lead to the violence and murder,

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:46.000
 the anger of the burning and boiling hell.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:49.000
 I am the Buddha, my powerful prayer.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:55.000
 May all the simply beings and the supreme no longer clean the pains.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:01.000
 The life and the error of our system.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:05.000
 A conceit mind will criticize and challenge others.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:08.000
 This will ask for bright and develop.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:12.000
 One will suffer the experience in the state of the world of fighting.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:15.000
 When proof of the disconnection is happening,

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:20.000
 I want to warn the good one who has been in the falling down.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:23.000
 I am the Buddha, my powerful prayer.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:31.000
 May all the simply beings and the still beings be restored in the self-refreshing awareness,

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
 and the relaxed equality towards them.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:38.000
 The habit of the pattern and the development of the witness is a concept.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:41.000
 Is it to praise one's own and the better of others?

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:47.000
 Me, me, me, me, and those in the world we call our own in the fighting.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:51.000
 We delete the bird and the enemy, the god of killers.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:54.000
 That is all the ones who call into the hell.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:57.000
 I am the Buddha, my powerful prayer.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:00.000
 May beings with increasing confidence through this,

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
 recover all their fight,

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:06.000
 no longer clean the enemy by relaxing their own mind,

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:09.000
 restore the self-refreshing awareness,

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:12.000
 and relax all the accomplished human system.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:17.000
 Being minus and distracted, foggy, dull, forgetful,

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:21.000
 and unconfident, called the lady in the England increase.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:25.000
 And it is all to this wondrous and helplessly in my life.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:29.000
 I am the Buddha, my powerful prayer.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:32.000
 May those all wonder in the God of England,

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:35.000
 the working of the mind, the clarity of my goodness,

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:41.000
 and by the power of this, relax all the simple beings

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:45.000
 and I share the same that matters.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:49.000
 But let in the mindfulness and the wonder and the soul.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:52.000
 They perform the actions, there is no meaning.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:56.000
 These six tales and the actions, I like that a little bit.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
 I am the primordial Buddha.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:03.000
 In order to change the beings with 60 hands,

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:06.000
 I thank the example of prayer.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:13.000
 And all the simple beings, which is part of the enlightened place,

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:19.000
 are who have a number of years in our union,

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:22.000
 who claim meditating awareness without a solution,

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:25.000
 perform this power of prayer.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:29.000
 All those who hear will reach in life the three words.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:33.000
 At the time of the eclipse in the sun,

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:39.000
 there are six hundreds in the good solid city.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:43.000
 In the time, visualize yourself, the supernatural.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:46.000
 And at the time of this power of prayer,

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:49.000
 pray to these things with 60 hands,

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:55.000
 perform of this prayer by releasing the suffering

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:59.000
 and ensure all beings will reach the Buddha home.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:03.000
 [singing]

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:48.000
 [singing]

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:54.000
 When page 29, according to this booklet,

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
 the widow is the wisdom raised,

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
 emanated from the body of the Buddha,

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:07.000
 purifying all of grace, myself and all beings.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:10.000
 Then the virtues of the path of the Mahayana

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
 and the primitive evolution,

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:15.000
 fair with the non-returned attention.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:20.000
 And now we do a board of five minute meditation.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000

 Anyway, this page 32.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:31.000
 Just as the bodhisattva meditation,

 at any realization,

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:36.000
 my wife is some of the other bodhisattvas.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:39.000
 In order to train my son to hold them,

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000

 And so those are all the different

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
 prayers of course as well

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
 as thinking of these people and as

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
 well as every living being

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
 as I said really thinking.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
 And representing everyone.

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
 And that means bodhicata.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
 Bodhicata is what we said.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
 May I, may the purpose

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
 of get the purpose to benefit

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
 for all the sentient beings

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
 I'm going to get enlightenment.

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
 I'm going to practice. I'm going to meditate.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
 I'm going to accomplish the meditate.

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
 Those are the what we said

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
 when we take the bodhicata of ours

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
 or when we do the different prayers

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
 and sadness. So now really

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
 activate that really intention.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
 Strongly heart, mind

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
 we've dedicated this meditate

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
 and join those prayers

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
 and

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
 wish that for part.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
 So as I said earlier

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
 world peace.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
 Extending the world peace.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
 Inwardly all

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
 the world peace means there's

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
 no more wars. No more naked

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
 disasters. And then also

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
 ourselves will more calm

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
 and peaceful and keep

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
 have the courage, the commitment

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
 to keep up our

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
 inequality, our resolution.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
 So our practices

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
 not shaken by

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
 hesitation and doubt and

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
 skeptical and then falling apart

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
 and kind of become the victim of

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
 ourselves by those emotions.

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
 Really wish and pray.

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
 So we stand in that. So all that

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
 and then we join the prayers

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
 and mantras. And I think start with

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
 the Buddha, pray of the great teacher

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
 of many prayers. So

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
 I think whenever you have that

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
 and here in this

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
 Palm Beget dharma center has selected

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
 the bullet of the

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
 all these mantras. So

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
 that you can have and

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
 otherwise it is

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
 bed 58 I think.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
 Inward for this one?

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
 Bed 58 is, I think

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
 this is a bullet.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:58.000
 78? Yeah.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
 In the Bible

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
 it is 78.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
 Yeah.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000

 This through 78.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
 78.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
 This bullet is

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
 78 and the Palm Beget

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000

 general goal. Met 500

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
 as the white lord was. Whoever

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
 heard your names well not

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
 returned to the samsara. Most

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000

 Blessed One.

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:59.000
 Another tribe of wrathful miters who give all the negative destroy of all the obstacles.

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:05.000
 I pray to you, please bless us and pacify out the innocent in the obstacles.

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:09.000
