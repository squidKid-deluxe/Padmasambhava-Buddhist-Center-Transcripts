Khenpo Tsewang Rinpoche\n\nJanuary 1 @ 9:00 am - 5:00 pm \n33rd Annual Vajrasattva & Vajrakilaya PBC New Year\u2019s Practice!\n\nMorning Vajrasattva fire puja practice:\n9am \u2013 12:00 noon\n\nAfternoon Vajrakilaya and Dharmapala practice with tsok:\n2:00 \u2013 5:00pm\n\nLet\u2019s begin the New Year\u2019s practice with Vajrasattva and Vajrakilaya! For 33 years this is one of the very special practices that we have been able to do in New York City through the open kindness of of our dear Dharma brother John Giorno.\n\nThis Vajrasattva fire puja practice mainly focuses on pacifying negativities and obstacles while increasing prosperity, joy, longevity, peace, and realization. It is a terma of Terdak Lingpa.\n\nVajrakilaya is the embodiment of all the buddhas\u2019 activities and is one of the most famous practices of the Nyingma school. Practicing on Vajrakilaya removes our obstacles, eases the flow of Dharma activity, and reveals the Buddha nature. Daily practice of Vajrakilaya is suggested as it is very powerful. Practice on special occasions is also very beneficial.\n\nMorning Practice:\n\nDaily Prayers \u2013 Opening and Dedication\nMinling Vajrasattva Fire Puja\nRiwo Sang Chod\n\nAfternoon Practice:\n\nDaily Prayers \u2013 Opening and Dedication\nVajrakilaya \u2013 Tsasum Lingpa (short)\nDharmapala Prayers\nKuntuzangpo Prayer\nWhite Umbrella\nGreat Cloud of Blessings\n \nPadma Samye Ling\n(607) 865-8068\njowozegyal@catskill.net\n\nwww.padmasambhava.org\n\nwww.padmasambhava.org/event/2020-new-years-vajrasattva-vajrakilaya-practices-with-ven-khenpo-tsewang-rinpoche",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500
 Welcome, Happy New Year, and welcome you all. Thank you.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.800
 Beethoven vision is such a very wonderful and beautiful practice.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:15.600
 Again, kindness of the late John, and his partner Hugo, they've both been so kind.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:21.400
 I mean, John, I know since 1973 in India, where he came to India.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:27.200
 So ever since, he's been so kind and very loyal to friends with me,

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.700
 and my brother late, brother Kimbo, for this year.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.700
 And so again, we had this opportunity to do this practice,

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.200
 and his partner is very much willing to continue to keep this place.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.700
 As that what John used to do really very much.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:51.800
 So I'm very happy and grateful for everyone, for John and as well as Hugo.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.800
 So again, I guess I'd like to extend it to you all.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.600
 Thank you very much for coming and participating.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:04.800
 This is a being as a kind of a John always uses historic events in the New York City,

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.900
 in small scale, scale, something good and wonderful, beautiful,

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.800
 low key, don't to the earth, thinking of love, kindness and concluding thoughts

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.300
 for all living beings, really not just kind of like bragging all there,

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.000
 but simple something doing and follow in the instructions

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.900
 of the great master of the lineage of love and compassion,

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.100
 that from the Buddha or the summoner by the Buddha Chaka money until now.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.100
 So we really were very kind of happy to do and I'm so happy

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.600
 and thankful all your body spirit and helping to part of this ceremony.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.500
 And this ceremony is a cleansing ceremony and for a significant ceremony,

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:54.300
 and also it is ceremony of the world peace for every living beings and beyond

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.300
 and as well as also environments.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:03.300
 So is inhabitant and as a habit, habitus to everyone really.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.800
 We think that as you see when you do practices, we find it also in English.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:15.000
 So you know that but each time reflecting those meanings in your heart and mind

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.300
 and really extend it, let that spread as a ripple effect

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.800
 with all the Northern light through every directions and beyond.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.300
 And also with this band, this practice is all those people who go on from sight.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.300
 That's our loved one.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.500
 So even we don't know them, but there's so many beings.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.600
 So really thinking of the practice with the bodhicata,

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.000
 when we have the bodhicata, there's no boundaries in a delicious kindness teacher.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.600
 But I say, think of every living beings, you're doing this practice.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.000
 So that's what we join.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.300
 Such as may all living beings have the happiness and cause of happiness.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:59.400
 We not say that all may present in things or our sight happiness and cause of happiness.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:07.300
 We our mind, our heart and our body that is open as like sky and reaching to everything really.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.400
 So this will reach to everyone and as well as as I said, also young

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.800
 and as well as everyone that who go on inside, really their profile and removing

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.100
 their old obstacles, obscurations or whatever and there's a blockage

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.200
 but having the higher realizations and fulfillment

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.000
 and in the pure land of the Buddha Dharma and all Amitabha and enlightenment.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.700
 So those all which we both thought, we do this practice.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.600
 Again, thank you very much everyone coming and the party spread.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.500
 Okay, thank you very much everyone.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.700
 Thank you. And now we begin to do the practices.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:49.200
 Yeah, first person, maybe we do silence meditation for maybe five minutes

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.700
 and then we begin the chanting meditation.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:18.500
