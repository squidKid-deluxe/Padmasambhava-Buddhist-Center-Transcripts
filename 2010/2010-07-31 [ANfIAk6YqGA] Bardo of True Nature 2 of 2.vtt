00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.480
 Then, it depends, then the teaching says all the peaceful words begin to come. One after another

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.000
 comes.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 And then as soon as that is kind of like we couldn't recognize, and then what is coming?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 Next is, there are a lot of words to come, one after another.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 That again we kind of missed one after another, we couldn't recognize.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.730
 And then there is the last one, in a way. The last one is poured from the lightest kind, one after

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:34.000
 another.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 So this is again, each time, if we recognize, as we practice during the lifetime,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 and such as the Vyasattva and the Sambhava, the Amitabha, all the Buddhas, as these peaceful, rapid

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 Buddhas,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 then you just see, see as, in a way, what you've been practicing during the lifetime,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 now you begin to see freshness, that without any frightening, without any kind of screening,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 immediately this is my own display.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:13.450
 The nature of the mind, moment that thought, will lead back, immediately lead to that state of the

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:14.000
 Buddha.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 And no more further and useless thing like that.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 Right there.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 But if we missed those all, one after another, then, in the teaching said,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 now, again it depends with the individualist, but mostly, then there is four lights coming.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 Those four lights are white, yellow, red, and blue.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:50.750
 Blue lights are coming so strongly, and those are also known as the "quat droplet light" of the

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.000
 western energies.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 And this is also passage of the Sigur Vaidya Sattva in the teaching said.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:07.480
 Sigur Vaidya Sattva, this is, again, that our own awareness, primordial western lights are shining

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.000
 out,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 in a way, shining out and giving, in one way, another opportunity to gain relaxation.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 Again, if you practice a foga in this light, such as foga, or the tutu, tutu practices,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 normally you see this light, and this is displayed on our own natural mind.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 And at that moment, you reach to the Daniel.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 Enlightenment of the Sambukhi status, state Vaidya Sattva, or Edna Sambhu,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 or Amitabha, or the Buddha famous meeting.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 Then, in the teaching said, why five pink light? The green light does not come.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 Because green light is not coming because still we are practicing.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 Green is action. Action is Buddha Buddha. Buddha Buddha action, we are not yet at that stage.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 So therefore, it comes only for light, and it is for lightness.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 And, truly, the light, light, beams of light, ripples of light, circles of light, all those terms.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 It comes, at the same time, in some teaching, or some, I think, individuals also experience another

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 kind of dull lights.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 Dull lights. Light is very, those, these poor lights are so powerful, so strong, so bright.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 But there is a dull light that comes almost undestructed with that.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 And then you feel more kind of comfortable with that light.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 And that is then kind of burnt to the samsara, or passage to the samsara state.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 That also happens in the teaching said.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 So once that kind of completed, completed, then in the teaching said, in the teaching again,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.220
 there is the final, almost the final, is then the true nature, the father of the true nature, in

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.000
 the way of final.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:11.870
 Then all the trees, all the rocks, all those lights that come almost completely, fill the whole sky

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.000
, spaces.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 At the same time, all the beams of experience are also kind of filled up.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 That formation is filled with spaces.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.390
 And then, mostly individually, those are all the Buddhas and the enlightenment is so powerful, so

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:33.000
 bright, so believed, so kind of majestic.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 And then you feel more kind of appealing.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 Appealing, more comfortable, more easy to those, those formations of the six realms.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 And that is how, again, attach it and then you can't.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 Around this time, now is ended this father of the true nature.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 As I said in the teaching, this could last through hours or through days.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 It's not that long.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 Generally, in the teaching, definitely said, it's not that long.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 Long is just through hours.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 So the true nature of father is now ended.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 Somehow, immediately recognize, now we are father of become.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 So we follow with this, this teaching here.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 Teaching, recognize what arise is self-appearance, awareness, is this there, realize it as the

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 impression of the interrelated state.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 It is father, father is a dreamer.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 Dream is the same thing.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 There is no difference.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 It is our own self-image of one's own awareness.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 So therefore, they don't escape.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:01.150
 When we reach to the most important turning point, or when we reach to the most crucial point,

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.000
 crucial point of our passage,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 and this is time, we try to not escape, afraid with our own self-display of the awareness,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 and be confident, be re-standingly our meditation practice in the lifetime.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:27.710
 If we are able to do that, then there is no more father of becoming, or father of this next, next,

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.000
 that we reach there.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 So therefore, in the teaching said, even we now, our physical situation is gone,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 that we are now in these stages, but still our mind is with us, consciousness is with us,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 and therefore, we can always re-stand in our meditation practices.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 This depends on how much we practice in our lifetimes.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 This practice is really quite good, even we couldn't recognize all these different stages,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 and still, even we are here, still there is opportunity to become enlightened, or higher rebirth,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 or we go to the buildings there, and that's the teaching said.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:22.000
 Because mind is so awful, everything related with mind is not missing at this time.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 We carry everything, physical things, material things, anything is left behind.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 But anything we do left with our mind, with our mind, is still continuing.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 Nothing is really missing, even though more can't be left bright, more blood,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 more can't be left stronger than even the lifetimes.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 Therefore, this is the time we still can remember that.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 So that is really part of the, part of the true nature.
