00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.120
 Thank you. Again, welcome and thank you for practicing. Thanks for coming together. It's

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:23.560
 great we can just support each other with our practice. We have some of our local Sangha

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:29.160
 here at Padma Samye Ling, and then also I know beyond this little black marble in front

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:36.440
 of me are at least, what, 20 or so people. So glad we're all here together, even though

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:43.280
 some of you are invisible, to me at least. But welcome. And again, it's just so special

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.460
 with everything going on in our own lives and in the world to really have this opportunity

00:00:49.460 --> 00:01:03.200
 to sit individually and together and contemplate these amazing, beautiful, profound, accessible,

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:09.480
 practical teachings that we have right in our hands and hearts. We've been so blessed

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:16.080
 to receive teachings and to practice and to continue, so just acknowledge that. And then

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:25.840
 along with that, as always, with every single time we do any activity, especially study,

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:33.400
 contemplation, practice, really reflecting on the three motivations, which are the three

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:42.160
 essential motivations of all the exquisite great perfection of the nine yanas we hold.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:50.920
 So again, just we'll take a few moments, just really connecting with our joy and our appreciation,

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:59.240
 our renunciation thoughts of just like how precious this time is. We're free of so many

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:07.600
 situations and in inner and outer endowed with so many fortunate circumstances and proclivities.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:15.960
 So just taking that and then, of course, expanding our bodhicitta far and wide. The mind in the

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:27.160
 teachings is empty, vast, open. So always expanding, expanding, expanding our imagination,

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:34.000
 opening our minds and our hearts and really acknowledging and wishing firmly that our

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:44.440
 time here together can really be of profound benefit to limitless beings. And then the

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:52.360
 third motivation, connecting with our pure perception, our devotion, you know, as to

00:02:52.360 --> 00:03:00.240
 whatever degree we can connecting with the purity of the three vajras, the purity of

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:12.040
 all forms as enlightened, all sound and movement as enlightened speech, all thought and mind,

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:21.800
 just the great enlightened dharmakaya space. And if anything, again, just wrapping it all

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:49.840
 up, how perfect this moment is. The perfect opportunity to wake up.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:57.560
 That said, the Buddha said, Guru Rinpoche said, all the great masters and one voice all remind

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:09.060
 us and say, "There's not a single Buddha or bodhisattva that didn't have a teacher."

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:15.440
 And we all know today we're going to just begin to touch, you know, with just overview

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:26.400
 of the guru yoga section of our nundra practice. And as we all know, the guru is so essential

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:34.040
 on every single level of the teachings, and especially in the Vajrayana, because we're

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:43.980
 again moving beyond our limited rigid fixed perspective and habitual patterns, having

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:51.040
 the support and guidance of someone with more knowledge, more wisdom, more realization is

00:04:51.040 --> 00:05:02.480
 such a gift and so essential. And so that's what we'll do, you know. It helps often, you

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:09.160
 know, to think about the word meaning of things. So I know guru yoga, and I think everyone

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:17.640
 knows, but again, reflecting on this guru and yoga, both Sanskrit words. And do you know

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:29.840
 the kind of the word meaning of guru and yoga? Again, it's profound words. I think the simplest

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:45.900
 meanings of those words on the word meaning level is guru is like heavy, rich, saturated,

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:53.680
 like you know, really high, revered. So this is a sense, the guru as the teacher, not just

00:05:53.680 --> 00:06:00.920
 a simple teacher, but heavy with blessings, you know, kind of like I know, Kenshin Pauldin

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:08.520
 and Ken Poseong said like heavy like a wish fulfilling tree just laden with fruits and

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:17.600
 so heavy, the bows are are are like bowing down, you know, heavy, saturated, full of

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:26.420
 blessings, full of realization, full of power, or like a, you know, huge, you know, rain

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:37.040
 clouds, you know, just about to burst with blessings, really, bringing upon our own realizations.

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:45.480
 So that's a sense of guru simple, you know, heavy, rich, high one, and yoga is very similar

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:56.920
 to like our word yoke. So yoga, I think, right is to yoke or to union, you know, to unite.

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:06.480
 So uniting with the heavy ones. And then in Tibetan, when the great realized translators

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:15.960
 were translating Buddhist vocabulary into Tibetan, then they made the word for guru

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:29.360
 or teacher, a llama, we've all heard. And then yoga is naljor. So guru yoga, lama naljor.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:37.040
 And so lama is very similar. And then that it's also made lama, it's like, there's nothing

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:49.160
 higher. No higher realization. No better blessings. You know, unsurpassable, just blessings

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.520
 realization,

00:07:50.520 --> 00:08:02.160
 your activity, nothing outside of it, nothing beyond it. And then the naljor is, again,

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:09.900
 very special too, because again, it, it's skillful. What it means, naljor, I think now

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:21.820
 is like the original or authentic. And jor is like to discover or to possess. So it's

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:32.040
 discovering or possessing what's authentic, and kind of original, what's primordial. So

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:39.520
 again, that's just getting back to this really core view and teaching in our practice of

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:46.440
 we're becoming with our practice in all the Buddhist teachings, more familiar with our,

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:55.800
 with the innate nature as it is. It's not that we're bringing separate things together,

00:08:55.800 --> 00:09:05.200
 you know, or just like in, in this, the Supreme symbols of like the bell and Dorje, you know,

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:12.160
 they're not in reality, there's the meaning, these aren't separate. It's the union of all

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:19.560
 appearances and emptiness, the union of the absolute and relative truth, the union of

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:27.860
 wisdom and compassion, they're inseparable aspects, just like the three kayas are inseparable.

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:33.260
 They're not three different places. They're different aspects of the nature for our we

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:40.640
 conceptually conceptual beings, you know, the Buddha's giving us these maps and tools

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:51.560
 to move beyond conception to be in union with our authentic nature. And again, that's the

00:09:51.560 --> 00:10:01.600
 only difference in the teachings. And which means in reality, our teachers, the Buddha's

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:09.480
 Guru Padmasambhava, have realized the true nature and our incomplete unity with the true

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:16.480
 nature and complete, they are the Dharma. They are the Buddha, they are the Dharma,

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:25.400
 they are the Sangha. And we, at least myself, haven't recognized that nature, maybe have

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:36.160
 a glimmer, but we're discovering and we have this great opportunity. So that can just be

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:44.120
 really helpful in understanding because again, the Guru, the teacher, the Lama, in the highest

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:55.720
 truest sense is appearing to help us discover our own Buddha nature, our own absolute bodhicitta,

00:10:55.720 --> 00:11:05.760
 to remove our obscurations and habitual patterns and let go of samsara and its causes and connect

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:16.560
 with the path of realizing, removing our obscurations and bringing out our innate wisdom, right?

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:25.480
 So the Lama embodies all the Buddhas, the Lama, when we take refuge in the very beginning,

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:32.040
 we take refuge in the Lama embodiment of the Buddha, all the Buddhas. And when we take

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:37.160
 refuge in the Three Jewels, the Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, we all know, ultimately, we were taking

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:45.080
 real refuge in the Buddha, the realization of the Buddha. Because from that realization,

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:55.280
 the compassion of the Dharma comes. And connecting with it are those who have realized it and honor

00:11:55.280 --> 00:12:04.760
 it and practice it, all of our experiences and opportunities to awaken. And then we also know,

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:11.320
 on the Vajrayana level, another aspect of the Three Jewels, the Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, what's

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:26.920
 called the Lama, Yidam and Dakini or Khandro. So the Lama or the Guru is said, right, is the source

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:38.520
 of all blessings, that supreme realization. The source of all blessings is the Lama. But then

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:44.580
 also inseparable from that, the Lama, Guru and Pashe is the embodiment of all the Buddhas,

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:54.680
 all the deities, all the Yiddams, which is the realization of all the Dharma. The source of all

00:12:54.680 --> 00:13:04.720
 realization is the Yiddam. The source of all enlightened activity happening so many ways to

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:14.320
 create more peace, to create more vitality, to kind of captivate our good, our goodness qualities,

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:23.770
 and to overwhelm our negative limited perceptions. All that is the work of the Dakinis and the Dak

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:23.840
as

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:31.760
 and Dharmapalas with the source of all enlightened activities who are inseparable from the Lama. So

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:37.240
 it's all coming back to the Lama. And then even with our nundra practice itself, we can see right,

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:47.480
 even with the four boundless, the very first line, where Lama, infallible protector, please be

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:47.720
 aware

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:56.320
 of me, calling to our mind, the presence of the Buddha, the presence of the Guru. And here in this

00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:06.000
 case, we're always practicing on Guru Padmasambhava throughout our practice. And in a nutshell, I

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:06.240
 mean

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:12.730
 Guru Padmasambhava is so profound, a living Buddha of this time, of this degenerate age, known as

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:12.920
 the

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:20.480
 second Buddha, was prophesied by Buddha Shakyamuni to come and even glorify the teachings even more

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:20.480
,

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:31.340
 and brought especially the higher teachings of the Vajrayana to this world, and especially to Tibet

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:31.480
.

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:39.400
 So within our tradition, Guru Padmasambhava is also so prime in that it's truly like the root

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:45.920
 teacher of all Tibetan Buddhism, you know, one of the prime forces that actually helped clear away

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:55.280
 the obstacles and set the seeds and bring such beautiful conditions along to bring the Dharma

00:14:55.280 --> 00:15:02.200
 to Tibet, and therefore to us now. And then throughout Tibet and throughout the world, so

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:11.080
 many practitioners have appeared of high capability, who are emanations of Padmasambhava. So many

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:19.120
 practitioners have had their own direct experiences with Padmasambhava. So the teacher is so

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:19.520
 profound,

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:27.280
 and again, brings us beyond conception to more direct perception of our authentic nature.

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:43.480
 So again, I don't want to spend too much time talking today, so just kind of remembering some

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:51.880
 of that basics, and then thought to go over the actual visualization we're doing and kind of look

00:15:51.880 --> 00:16:06.880
 at that section of the Nundro. So when we look at the the Nundro practice in general, right, all of

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:14.600
 our practice, we're always beginning with thinking of Guru Padmasambhava as embodiment of all the

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:23.790
 Buddhas of the three times, as inseparable from our own teacher. And again, just to remember, it

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:24.160
 said,

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:30.840
 our own teacher in this life is more kind than all the Buddhas. They're actually in our life,

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:42.000
 before our eyes, in our perception, knowing us as we are now, helping, you know, helping us see

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:42.200
 more

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:47.200
 clearly, bringing out our own goodness qualities, bestowing so many teachings and blessings.

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:56.470
 Bringing the teacher to our mind and heart, really, we should be, it's so powerful and beneficial

00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:56.600
 to

00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:04.800
 do all the time, again, because it's like a beautiful sun bringing out our own naturalness.

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:12.480
 So we always begin our practice thinking of the Buddhas and thinking of all the lineage masters,

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:19.800
 and then often, too, calling the Lama from afar, like we usually recite this beautiful calling the

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:27.200
 Lama from afar prayer by Dudram Rinpoche, but even just the seven line prayer itself is calling the

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:35.570
 Lama from afar. Or there's so there's many other prayers too, but really feeling that living

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:35.800
 presence

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:47.040
 of the Lama of Guru Padmasambhava, inseparable from our own teacher in this life, is vital and good

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:47.040
.

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:54.240
 And just like the true words of the Buddha and Padmasambhava, anyone who thinks of me and calls

00:17:54.240 --> 00:18:04.720
 upon me, that moment I'm there, the Buddhas are not limited. So we're really being real here with

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:10.880
 our practice. And then we go through and like I already quickly mentioned, in the four thoughts

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:19.600
 that turn the mind just in general, they just help us recognize our position and our place and kind

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:25.280
 of reflect on some of the facts of life, which often we're kind of ignoring or kind of having

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:34.120
 expectations contrary to them. But we begin thinking of the Lama, infallible protector, please be

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:34.400
 aware

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:40.520
 of me. And like we've mentioned before, and it's worth mentioning again, this isn't just outer Lama

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:40.640
,

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:47.820
 maybe Kim Po Se Wong Rinpoche is also pointed out many times. This is also, of course, think

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:48.240
 feeling

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:56.320
 the presence of the outer Lama, the absolute Lama. But then our own Lama is what we're also

00:18:56.320 --> 00:19:05.520
 needing. And so this is also reigniting our own mindfulness, alertness, conscientiousness.

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:12.720
 That's what is our own Lama that we can, that we really need, no matter what anyone else can

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:19.680
 guide us to do, having our mindfulness, our alertness, our conscientiousness on and off the cushion

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:27.440
 with the outer nundra of the four thoughts or the inner nundra of the main nundra sections.

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:36.400
 Keeping that mindfulness, alertness, conscientiousness with us gracefully, gently, but present

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:44.960
 is the three great supports like Kim Po calls, and then going through thinking of these. And then,

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:52.480
 of course, with refuge, we're taking refuge in the Lama embodiment of the three jewels,

00:19:52.480 --> 00:20:00.320
 the three roots from now until we are completely awakened, all our obscurations are removed,

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:07.600
 and then we settle at the end of the session, take the ultimate. Again, it's in a way another guru

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:16.320
 yoga, just relax, mingle our own mind with Guru Padmasambhava, relax in awareness.

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:24.400
 And then again, reappearing before us is who? Guru Padmasambhava and all the objects of refuge,

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:33.200
 being witness to our bodhicitta commitment. And then we're making the mandala offering to the

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:45.040
 Lama, offering all of our experiences to the three jewels, bringing out our wisdom, which is so

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:54.000
 fundamental, and generating positive merit through great generosity and openness, and then removing

00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:02.000
 our obscurations like we talked about a couple of weeks ago, who's there, our Guru Padmasambhava,

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:11.760
 our own teacher, inseparable from Vajrasattva, witnessing all of our downfalls and mistakes

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:20.960
 along with us, and purifying, cleansing, awakening. And then we get to our main section of the Guru

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:31.680
 Yoga, the swiftly penetrating blessings of the Guru Yoga. So we'll just kind of quickly go over

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:41.440
 this. And we've done this many times, but these lines are here, right? "Once self is Vajrayogini,

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:47.040
 and in the sky in front, the root teacher manifests in the form of Padmasambhava."

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:59.440
 So here, again, from the very start, we're really dropping our mundane samsara conceptions.

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:06.080
 We're really, again, expanding our minds. And then here we have these skillful means

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:16.000
 of the visualization, which, again, is using concepts to move beyond concepts.

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:25.920
 And so here we're not just in our ordinary, regular form, but we're actually feeling

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:35.360
 ourselves and visualizing ourselves as Vajrayogini. Yeshisoja, who's the perfect student,

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:46.320
 Vajrayogini, mother of all the Buddhas, Prajnaparamita, the universal mother,

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:53.760
 Yeshisoja, the delightful, passionate consort of Padmasambhava.

00:22:53.760 --> 00:23:08.400
 And then we're not just in our ordinary body. We're in an extraordinary place.

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:17.520
 The whole universe is transformed into the pure land. Everything is shining with wisdom light,

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:26.800
 reverberating with meaning and peace and grace and beauty.

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:39.840
 Uncontrived, but just knowing this is a pure land and ourselves as Vajrayogini. It's Yeshisoja.

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:45.600
 And so there's a few different visualizations. And the Duddham Rinpoche's visualization,

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:53.760
 I think we know to just kind of review, we're standing where we are Yeshisoja, Vajrayogini.

00:23:55.680 --> 00:24:03.440
 We have two arms, two legs, one face. We have a female form.

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:12.880
 Our body is ruby red. And again, all of this is not substantial. This is

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:19.440
 transcendental wisdom rainbow body. All is vivid, yet empty.

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:27.520
 That's how it is. But that's we're kind of just being aware of this. This is actually

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:42.160
 I am Yeshisoja. Two arms, two legs, ruby red. I'm standing with my right foot slightly forward,

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:52.880
 ready to act and benefit others on a sun and moon disk, crushing the corpse of this of mundane ego

00:24:52.880 --> 00:25:02.880
 clinging and negative emotions and grasping. Majestic in our form is we are, you know, in the

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:12.600
 form of a 16 year old in the teachings, like very, just very prime of youth and voluptuous,

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:13.760
 youthful,

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:19.520
 we're semi wrathful. Sometimes the Buddha's are appearing very peaceful,

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:23.440
 sometimes very wrathful, then they're semi wrathful. So we're both.

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:31.920
 We have beautiful black golden plated hair, we're standing naked with bone ornaments.

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:38.720
 And silks and jewels and tinkling bells blowing in the in the graceful winds.

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:47.840
 You know, we're holding in our left hand, we're holding a skull cup, just brimming with ambrosia

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:55.840
 and and rakta. And then in our right hand, we're holding a copper colored curved knife

00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:02.640
 with a vajra that's handle is a vajra, you know, up.

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:14.000
 And, you know, we have a third eye. And then, of course, we always we're on the inner level, too.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:21.440
 We're recognizing the pure view of, right, all of all of the elements that make up our body

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:27.440
 are the five, the five wisdom mothers

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:34.800
 who are in inseparable union with the five male Buddhas, the five aggregates.

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:41.360
 And then just like every month during our dakini practice, when we do the the Yumka Dechanjalmo,

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:48.640
 I mean, we all whoever has done that, right, to some degree, it's very detailed with what we can

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:55.440
 do as we're visualizing ourselves as Vajrayogini here. But those are maybe the point. And then

00:26:55.440 --> 00:27:03.440
 before us, feeling the presence seeing Guru Padmasambhava, feeling his presence again,

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:11.760
 just in transcendental wisdom, rainbow body, splendid, emanating, just all kinds of wisdom

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:21.440
 lights clearly in the sky, majestic, so present, full of bliss and blessings, love, and just

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:22.000
 supreme

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:32.560
 seeing and omniscience. You know, he's wearing the three robes on the inner level. He's wearing

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:37.680
 the on the outer level, he has the brocade cloak, cloak, and then he's wearing a blue

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:45.280
 kind of chuba underneath, and then beneath that, some white undergarments. What is that? That's

00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:54.640
 representing the perfection of that practicing and holding the three vows of the foundational

00:27:54.640 --> 00:28:02.960
 Buddhism of Vinaya, Theravadin Buddhism, and Mahayana Buddhism, and Vajrayana Buddhism,

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:09.680
 and separately, holding the three vows and separately. And in his left hand, holding the

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:17.440
 skull cup with swirling active ambrosia and the long life face, full of vitality.

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:24.240
 And then in the right hand, holding, you know, the unshakable awareness of the Vatra.

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:33.760
 And with the Katvanga, representing kind of the wisdom consort, and just the realization of the

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:43.200
 three kayas, and the profound in meaning. And then also ornamented with other jewels,

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:52.480
 wearing the lotus hat, giving to him by, I think, the king of Zohar, after the king kind of out of

00:28:52.480 --> 00:29:01.680
 great fear, tried to burn Guru Padma Sambhava alive, and then found several days later, Guru Padma

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:07.520
 Sambhava just shining, resplendent in a lake that had formed. It really turned the king's mind

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:08.160
 towards

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:13.920
 the Dharma, and the beauty and the powerful, beautiful example of Guru Padma Sambhava,

00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:24.240
 after being attacked, just being pure, full of love, gracing the land with pure waters,

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:31.440
 untouched by the fire. So the king offered him this hat we often see that has the three peaks,

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:37.760
 and I mean, five peaks, like the five wisdoms and the vajra, and then the vulture feather,

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:44.720
 which represents kind of like the highest view. So it's, anyway, there's many details to Guru Padma

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:52.480
 Sambhava, and full of meaning, and that's also part of our realization. It's like we don't need to

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:52.800
 get

00:29:52.800 --> 00:30:00.000
 fixated on the meaning, but reflecting on some of the way the symbols echo and can bring up

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:07.600
 meaning in our heart, and remember the teachings. Again, not just to study, contemplate, but to

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:07.920
 bring

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:14.880
 some realization of that meaning, because for the Buddhas, everything is meaning, and everything is

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:24.560
 empty. That's omniscience, right? So whether we can see all the details of the visualization or not

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:24.560
,

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:33.520
 most important, most fundamental, essential is our devotion, is our closeness feeling,

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:38.480
 to whatever degree it is, just some interest,

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:49.120
 or wanting to know more, or actually beginning to study a little more, beginning to practice more,

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:57.600
 having more trust and confidence in the practice until it's completely unshakable and valuable.

00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:08.880
 What that closeness feeling, that kind of longing, respect, joy, just cherishing, you know, and

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:09.360
 trust

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:14.400
 is some of the words that can connect with devotion.

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:24.400
 That's what's really, like they say in the teachings, devotion opens the door to realization

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:33.200
 and blessings, that openness, that kind of where we can both with concepts move beyond concepts,

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:40.560
 because we have that deeper trust that's coming out of some degree of experience.

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:48.240
 So feeling the presence of Guru Patma Sambhava, inseparable from our own precious teacher,

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:54.080
 and all the buddhas of the three times is most important, whether we can do the visualization

00:31:54.080 --> 00:32:05.760
 or not. So once we have this kind of atmosphere of purity and devotion, then we're in one voice,

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:17.450
 making this supplication as Vajrayogini, inseparable from ourselves to Guru Patma Sambhava,

00:32:17.450 --> 00:32:18.720
 embodiment

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:25.600
 of all the buddhas of the three times without exception, most excellent root teacher, I pray

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:33.200
 to you. In this and future lives and in the bardo, in these three, hold me with your compassion,

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:36.880
 bless me ceaselessly throughout the three times.

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:45.360
 So again, with all of our chanting, as much as we can, trying to keep our mindfulness,

00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:53.040
 our alertness, our conscientiousness, as we're chanting, connecting with our heart and our meaning,

00:32:53.040 --> 00:33:02.720
 and making this prayer. These are the words of Guru Patma Sambhava actually, so special.

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:11.520
 So we recite this part three times, and then I thought to say, often Rinpoche's,

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:15.600
 they do give the instruction when we have time and we're doing the Guru Yoga.

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:23.120
 After we recite this supplication three times, it's not part of the root text, but if you have

00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:31.200
 time, it's very powerful, very beneficial to just again increase that connection with the

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:38.240
 presence and blessings of Guru Patma Sambhava by reciting the seven-line prayer again,

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:46.160
 at least three times, again with joy, with devotion, with bodhicitta,

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:58.480
 reciting the seven-line prayer, this profound prayer chanted by, that's self-eminated and

00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:03.920
 just chanted by hundreds and thousands of practitioners through the ages.

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:12.400
 It's inseparable from Guru Patma Sambhava, so rich in meaning, outer, inner, secret, absolute.

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:20.240
 It is Patma Sambhava. So if you have time, reciting the seven-line prayer is an instruction from

00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:26.800
 Kimpo Rinpoche's, if it's possible. Usually by the time we get to there in our Saturday practice,

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:32.480
 there isn't, I'm trying to kind of conserve time, so I've omitted it, but definitely if

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:40.800
 you have time, do that. And then the main practice, then we'll move to simplifying the practice,

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:47.680
 keeping all of the visualization, all of the motivation, feeling the presence even stronger

00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:55.100
 then, we'll just simplify by reciting the mantra of Guru Patma Sambhava, Omahum Badra Guru Pema

00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:57.200
 Siddhihum,

00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:06.880
 and just reciting that. And then of course mantra is so profound, there's no single meaning,

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:12.880
 it's profound, I won't go into trying to give any even simple kind of word meanings for the

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:19.200
 Vajra Guru mantra right now, but we can, we've all heard them or can look them up too. There's a

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:28.400
 beautiful translation of a terma from Yeshisoja on the meaning and the benefits of reciting the

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:34.240
 Vajra Guru mantra, which can be found at on Lotzawa house. I think it's called something like that,

00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:41.200
 the benefits of reciting the Vajra Guru mantra or something like that. So it's profound, but as we

00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:41.280
're

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:48.640
 reciting, again, these pure words, we're focusing, reciting, letting each syllable be clearly

00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:49.600
 pronounced

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:58.170
 and kind of visualizing the syllables, not too loud, not too soft, letting it reverberate in our

00:35:58.170 --> 00:35:58.800
 body

00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:06.160
 and echo in our space. And as we're reciting it, keeping the visualization and as we're doing the

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:16.560
 visualization, just seeing and feeling so many wisdom lights of all the vivid, bright rainbow

00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:25.040
 colors coming from Guru Padmasambhava, along with so many blessings and appearing in so many ways,

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:31.840
 there can be, according to the teachings, can be lights are all coming and raining, nectar is

00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:39.120
 falling and raining through us, every pore, all kinds of, you know, incy little forms of Guru

00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:45.520
 Padmasambhava and ritual elements can be just blessing, just showers of blessings coming and

00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:53.280
 filling ourselves and also going to all the beings, just expanding our bodhicitta, bringing

00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:53.760
 blessings

00:36:53.760 --> 00:37:01.120
 to all beings and letting our joy and devotion be kind of offering and are just making our

00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:07.760
 connection with Guru Padmasambhava, the living Buddha who's with us right now is the main point.

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:13.680
 And then we can at times too, we're receiving the four empowerments as we're reciting the mantra

00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:21.680
 as well. So like from Guru Rinpoche's crown, you know, this white vibrant, you know, white light

00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:32.240
 comes with Om to the Om in our crown and is giving all, you know, body blessings from Ah

00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:39.360
 is the ruby red of Guru Rinpoche is coming to the Ah in our own throat, bringing all the speech

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:47.200
 blessings and the sapphire blue light from the home in Guru Rinpoche's heart is coming to the home

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:55.600
 in our heart and filling up that chakra, bringing all the mind blessings. And from all the three

00:37:55.600 --> 00:38:01.600
 places in the Guru, kind of all blessings are coming, removing all of our obscurations.

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:10.240
 So we recite as long as we can, just reflecting, relaxing, feeling the presence

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:19.040
 for as much as we have time. And then when we finish, we're kind of going to seal the visualization

00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:19.040
.

00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:26.000
 So the blessings and empowerments of body, speech and mind are completely and perfectly

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:32.000
 obtained where we're kind of sealing the little practice session there. And then of course we have

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:42.560
 Vajra, Vajra Guru, Kaya, Waka, Sita, Sidi, Hung. So Vajra is of course indestructible Guru, you

00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:42.800
 know,

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:48.800
 and Kaya means we're receiving the body blessings. And then too we you can just simply do this or

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:57.360
 sometimes this Mudra is like making like a five-pointed Vajra. But anyway, Kaya,

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:08.880
 Waka is a speech blessing, Sita is the mind blessing, and Sidi, Hung is all the blessings

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:17.680
 we're receiving. So right from the white Om we're coming, all of our the obscurations

00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:29.680
 of from the actions of our body are completely purified. And then we've like completely qualified

00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:36.880
 stirring the seeds of awakening to our own Nirmana Kaya realization and accomplishment.

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:45.280
 That's called the vase empowerment. And then from the ah, the red ah, is removing all the

00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:52.240
 obscurations and negativities we've accumulated to our speech, just completely purifying them,

00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:58.400
 bringing out our own enlightened speech. And that's actually stirring the seeds of awakening

00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:04.720
 our some Boga Kaya realization and accomplishment. That's known as the secret empowerment.

00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:13.200
 And then from the blue, sapphire blue home coming, that's removing all of our mind

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:19.600
 obscurations, bringing out our own enlightened mind, awakening and stirring the seeds of our

00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:27.440
 own Dharmakaya Buddhahood realization. That's called the wisdom empowerment.

00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:35.200
 And then the fourth empowerment from all three places, all lights are coming to all of our

00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:41.920
 three main chakras to all of us. And just removing all of our subtle obscurations,

00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:48.240
 the most subtle, completely bringing out our full Buddhahood. And that's kind of the unity,

00:40:48.240 --> 00:41:02.240
 inseparable unity of the three Kaya state, which is again that union, the authentic original

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:10.640
 state we're completely familiar with and awakened with. It's completely received these blessings.

00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:17.680
 And then we're going to, again, relax, let go. So then we have the part where we're kind of letting

00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:25.600
 the visualization dissolve. And there's two ways we can do that. One way is that as Vajrayogini,

00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:32.480
 we're just like kind of like evaporate up, just right into Gurumpushe's heart.

00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:40.320
 The other way, maybe that's just from a different perspective, Gurumpushe can kind of dissolve into

00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:49.360
 a tiny white light imprinted with home or she, like the size of a pea. And that's embodying

00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:58.560
 everything, you know, so full, vibrant, empty bliss, coming, coming down and being received

00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:06.400
 right into the top of our central channel, kind of just like coming down through our central

00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:06.800
 channel,

00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:15.840
 through our crown chakra, through our speech chakra, coming down and just resting in our

00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:22.080
 heart of hearts and the depths of our hearts. And then just letting that relax and dissolve.

00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:30.240
 And then we're just, again, just unite, just relax. Like it says, behold the emptiness awareness,

00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:40.720
 the true face of the Lama. So resting in Rigpa, resting in our awareness, look to the looker,

00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:52.240
 start to have more, just be with that. So that's all I'll say for now, for our teachings.

00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:58.400
 And again, doing the practice, I know we all know it, but maybe we all just have even more

00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:09.200
 inclination and opportunity to really practice. And of course, studying to some degree is so

00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:16.560
 important. But practicing what we study, whatever we've heard is so important. And again, the Guru

00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:25.840
 Yoga is so supreme, because this is so direct, so immediate, and so powerful. Just all of our

00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:34.240
 teachers are reminding us again and again and again, how powerful it is to do the Guru Yoga and

00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:34.480
 keep

00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:42.480
 the presence of Guru Padmasambhava with us, the thoughts of our own precious teacher with us,

00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:51.750
 inseparable from Guru Pishye. So that's all I'll say for now. Now let's actually do what I'm saying

00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:51.760
,

00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:56.640
 and we'll do the practice. So we'll just take a few moments to

00:43:56.640 --> 00:44:03.280
 just relax, and then we'll go to our Dhrjum Tursar Nundral practice.

00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:18.960
 [silence]
