00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.070
 It is, but on absolute level, it is not here. Therefore, we should not be grasping as solid

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:10.000
 existing.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:18.750
 So Buddha is a teaching of the to remove wing, to release and grasping of all the object to this

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.000
 everything.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:31.840
 That's what the teaching is. And then, all those five senses, the object senses, there are six

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.000
 object senses.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 And the senses is what? It is no eye-sensing, for example. No eye-senses. No eye-sensing.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.700
 The senses of consciousness is mind. And mind, already we discuss it in the Dokki teaching here too

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.000
.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 There is no substantially solid entities of the mind at all that we cannot, we cannot find.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 So mind is empty. Empty on the absolute level. Level is empty.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 Same way, now object of eye is formed. And forms are empty. And that is again, forms are empty.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 And because it is what? Emptiness forms are the hip of the atoms. Atoms, hip of atoms.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 And it, atoms are also hip of atoms. And this is not just one combination. There is no entities.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 It is all illusion, bubble-hunter, hip-up. And for that reason, great master Chaitaraki,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 he has a very famous book, Mademaka book, that's called Uma Ji, or Mademaka Onama.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 And that teaching is very big in the one he said. He said, all we Buddhists or non-Buddhists,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:10.740
 whatever they say is not solid existing at all. But all because is free from one and free from

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.000
 minutes.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 Free from one and free from many means there is no one solid existing atom. There is no solid.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 And since there is one solid atom not existing, then whatever the combination is saying.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 So therefore, this is one of the famous in Mademaka reasoning, in Mademaka reasoning,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 to bring out everything as display of the emptiness. And one great master Chaitaraki said,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 everything is like not existing as solid, same as metal images. Metal images.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 Metal images is not really existing. They are solid when you see.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 Or if I use reflection moon in the water, reflection moon in the water is not solid existing.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:21.200
 It's just a reflection. So palm, palm is emptiness, for example, for example, for example,

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.000
 reflection moon in the water.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 That's it. And then emptiness, the palm, for example, the rainbow.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:41.300
 His suits are off. So I did not see that. But I just thought when I see this to you that form is an

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:42.000
 emptiness

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 as a reflection moon in the water because up there is a moon. But that moon is not really existing

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 as we see.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 So this form is like that. Then emptiness is a form. Form.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 So that means from emptiness arises form. Form, and I use it here now, for example, as rainbow.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 Rainbow just comes from the space. It's not really there. It's not originally there. It comes.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.490
 And we also don't know where all that comes. And of course, there is some explanation about the

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:22.000
 molecule,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 this and that. But where does that all come from? Come from, going deeper. It's just a rainbow.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 So therefore, this is what the form is like, like emptiness.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:42.290
 That is the same way this feels so draft. And what is among the five successes, one object is a

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:43.000
 sound.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 Sound is an emptiness. Again, same thing. Sound is an emptiness.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 Where sound comes from? Sound is not just governed by one's itself.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 I mean in the Buddha's teaching, the teaching says there is a divided sound, two sounds.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 That sound that connects with consciousness, a sound that is not connected with consciousness.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 So that is the true sound. A sound that connects with consciousness or intelligence is our sound.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 This speaking sound. This is with mind. So it's speaking.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 Sound that is not connected with consciousness is then element sounds.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.990
 Element sounds. And a sound that is connected with consciousness and not consciousness with the

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:33.000
 element,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:42.300
 combination is exactly beating the drums. Drums are echoing what's called calling to the rock in a

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.000
 road called bank.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 So it has both. But where did that come from? Where is that existing?

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 Even though it's here too, but where is that?

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 If you look there, that's what is called sound and emptiness. It's not just making that everything.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 So that's what I didn't go yesterday, all those things. I thought we just knew already that.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 That's what they did. Sound. And smell. Smell is the same thing.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 Smell is no solitude, one smell that is existing.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 It's a combination of so many smells. And what the smell in the Buddha's teaching said,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 smell that is produced by the, we produce smell and unnatural smells and combinations.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 Those are the smells. But even though it comes upon the relative level like that,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 but if you look carefully where those smells coming, items,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 we're looking to the thoroughly, from the top to the bottom, not just on the surface harboring.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 That's what we'll be doing in the erotic world all the time.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:05.000
 But today we're looking to the deep dome. That's why we're uprooting this notion of the

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 solitude, grasping, cleanness, sound, smell, and the taste too.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 Taste is what? There is about six different tastes.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 And the combination, many of those are the, I don't know exactly,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 those are translated in English, but sweet, sour, and not pure.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 And then this sort of taste then, I mean there's six, according to Buddhism, there's six.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 And then combination that goes, and then even hundreds of flavors come.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 But it's where that is again. It's where that exists. That is what we do.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 And then touch. Touch is, touch is the touch. And touch is what?

00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:01.000
 Where that, again, touch. Touch is combination of one's own consciousness and others, other objects

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000
 that touch.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:09.760
 Those are the touches in Buddhism, in the teachings, those are light and heavy, smooth, broad, and

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:12.000
 hot, cold, and so forth.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 But we look exactly where that touch is. That's what it's called.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:26.820
 This is the logic of only this thing. All phenomena here say, all phenomena existing, it's the same

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:28.000
 nature.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 Even though they appear as it is, or see, reality is, there is no, no solid existing.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 Maybe I have used also the word nature of the emptiness, emptiness, and whatever terminology I use,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 I'm referring the same thing. There's nothing. I mean, it's in the teaching here, I want to say.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 Emptiness, nature of emptiness, emptiness and, what else I said?

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:04.000
 I have no nature. I have no nature. All these, I'm referring, same thing, exactly the same thing.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:10.970
 Use those terminology so we shouldn't, that is the same thing. The witness is this booklet, is the

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:12.000
 witness.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 Okay, thank you, y'all.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000
 Bye, y'all.
