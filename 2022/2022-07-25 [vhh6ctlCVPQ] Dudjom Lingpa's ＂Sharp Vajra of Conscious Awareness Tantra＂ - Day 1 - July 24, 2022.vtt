00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.760
 Thank you very much, everyone, again. Thank you very much again for your participation

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:14.120
 and coming. Thank you very much. Thank you. Welcome. Welcome, everyone. Again, thanks

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:21.520
 for coming. Today, again, I think we are going to begin teaching on the great Masada and

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:30.000
 great Terton Dudjom Lingpa. We are going to begin, "According My Capabilities." We explore.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.960
 And again, of course, you can also read. There is already, I understood, that already translated

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:44.840
 this book, very well-known scholar, Alan Wallace, translated all that so you can explore more

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:53.120
 from those books. However, I will go with my capabilities according to what I can tell

00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:01.680
 and what I can offer to you as to reminding and some degree to kind of reconnecting to

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.660
 the teaching, to the lineage, to the practice, or some degree, maybe some small degree, clar

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:08.560
ifications,

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.560
 what I'm going to talk about. Hopefully, that's my intention and that's my place. And again,

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.800
 to begin this is, of course, is teaching of the Bodhﾄ…aktamﾄ）at, the greatest, kindest,

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.880
 compared to the teacher of the Bodhﾄ…aktamﾄ）at teaching. So therefore, this teaching is so

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:33.280
 precious, so special, really so marvelous, everywhere. Everywhere. Therefore, this is

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:40.680
 not just so accidental. We are connected to this. Truly, we are connected to this teaching.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:50.120
 In past times, today, in a way, we are activating the deepening of this knowledge. For that

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:57.960
 reason, for the great joy. Again, this is not just joy, but motivation is so important.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:05.600
 We like to receive the teaching, observe that teaching into the heart, and like to get benefit.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:12.120
 As teaching mentioned, teaching said, all the great masters said, one after another,

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:19.580
 and we like to get, we have to correct the motivation. What that means? Because we can't

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:29.880
 keep a regular mundane conception, mundane conception of the dualities, emotions, self-important,

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:39.040
 to the ego clings. That won't work very well. Even we are receiving the natural of the teaching

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:45.120
 of practice and natural teaching, it will go out. It will out. That means natural, when

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:54.000
 you pull, if the contain is not prepared nicely, it will fail out, or go out is wasted. Therefore,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.840
 to do that is all in our hand. It's not somebody have to do that for us. We have to activate

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.920
 it, prepare ourselves. It's not something also we have to make big effort externally

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:14.800
 to do these and that thing. But in the teaching, it's motivation, intention. Everything is

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:25.320
 dependent on the intention. Mind is powerful. Mind is instrumental. Mind is a direct tool.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:32.640
 Mind lead everything. Lead to the samsara, lead to the nirvana or the enlightenment. It's

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:41.080
 nobody else's mind we are talking. Our own mind, your mind, my mind. So therefore, thinking

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:48.760
 to benefit ourself, to myself or others, to benefit to others too, we have to make strong

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:55.280
 ourselves, right correction, motivation. This motivation is also nothing strange. It's not

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:02.640
 something Buddhist or dogma or strange things I have to do now, Buddhism. Buddhism is just

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:09.240
 the goodness of our quality. Whether we are believers, whether we don't believe, we always

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:16.520
 talk the goodness, good. Good is not coming outside or there is nothing kind of created

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:24.760
 good things or we have to grab. It's all in this mind. So correct the motivation. Which

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:32.600
 motivation is as I said, it's a symbol. Joy in the appreciation. Joy in the appreciation.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:39.600
 Joy in the appreciation to the Buddha, to the Dharma, to the Sangha and joy in the appreciation

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:45.720
 to the teaching that we are receiving. We are going to practice. Teaching is also not

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:51.320
 something or I have to burden or because I'm practicing Dharma, I have to be joy and appreciate

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:58.040
 something to the Dharma. Actually, think of Dharma. What is really Dharma? Dharma is no

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:06.120
 other than our goodness, your love, your kindness, your compassion, make ourselves more meaningful,

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:13.200
 more happy, more peaceful, more kind of like richness of our life. That is Dharma. Buddha

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:18.480
 did not give something that strange things you have to do in order to make yourself.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:23.800
 That's what Buddha himself, the gracious teacher, Buddha himself said, I show you the path.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:33.480
 I show the path. Technic. It's all for you. You, how you put. This is what we do. The

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:40.440
 motivation is really so important and I mentioned that quite a few times and you also know.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:46.040
 Every teacher explaining that. Every master when you go to the teaching, the greater masters,

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:53.560
 they always said, so motivation is mind. And among the motivation, so many motivation,

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:59.240
 the motivation mind has so many, many mind towards the conservatives, it arises endless.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:05.880
 But among there is something meaningful, something special that benefit to me, to the other beings

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:13.240
 or some make happy ourselves, peace for ourselves, not always kind of tired and anxiety and

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:13.800
 skeptical

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:22.680
 and doubt, hesitation and fears, F-E-A-R, fears and always no doubt and all that. Those are

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:30.040
 the mundane world duality. We had that so many times. We are saturated with that. But according

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:37.320
 Buddhism from the biggest time until now, now what we call here, sometimes in American expression,

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:44.600
 enough is another thing. And we have the really mind in our, in heart and brain, we have to reset

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:52.200
 the mind. So joy and the appreciation is simple. We have a lot of reason to be happy in joy,

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:59.880
 glorify that, not always kind of missing, not one, not enough, this and that, that is ego.

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:09.000
 Really ego, self-important, that is ego maniacs. That's what I really did. We should bring more joy

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:15.880
 and more appreciation, celebrate of our life, the richness we have. That is what, that is called

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:21.880
 practitioners. We're not out of the practitioners. We are the center, the very foundation of the

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:30.280
 Dharma. Joy and appreciation, joy and appreciation of our life, our situation and circumstances,

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:34.760
 joy and appreciation of the teachings. And according to the Buddha teaching, we have

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:41.080
 18 endowment that we know. We all have, it's not just a methodology, stories, truly we have.

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:46.520
 Everything counted one after another, 18 things we have. Really, plus we have more.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:55.240
 So joy and appreciation is the first motivation. Second motivation is then bodhicitta. We are all

00:07:55.240 --> 00:08:01.480
 the practitioners of Mahayana. Generally Buddha teaching is nonviolence, violence, peace and

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:09.000
 harmony to all the beings, but specifically in Mahayana, Mahayana highlighted bodhicitta,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.760
 low and kind as a compared thought. Again, this is not just something that we do, have to do,

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:23.000
 bodhicitta to help or to please someone. Bodhicitta is our mind and we have really bodhicitta.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:31.160
 We will be happy. We will be rich. Heart is rich, really rich. We become billionaire of the,

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:38.840
 billionaires, not multi-billionaires. Really we have the heart rich, love and compassion.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:46.280
 Come, we leave, we take that rich, not just leave behind, we take rich that rich, we go with

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:53.320
 according to the Buddha teachings and teachings of Sambhava. We will be rich in this life,

00:08:53.320 --> 00:09:00.680
 we will be rich in the pardo, we will be rich in the future lives. So there are bodhicitta.

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:06.600
 Again, bodhicitta is something kind of all different things. No, what is bodhicitta?

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:16.840
 Loving kindness, compassion, the wisdom, combined together to all the living beings, to really wish

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:23.800
 good things. That is bodhicitta and that is important. That is the foundation. Even we

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:29.240
 practice the zukin and we don't have this motivation. It really won't work. It won't work.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:35.720
 We've been practicing so long, nothing happened. But we say that too. Myself think too that.

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:40.760
 Because why? Because we're lacking those fundamental qualities.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:49.960
 Really lacking. Therefore, if we activated those, this joy and appreciation, bodhicitta,

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:57.880
 teachings will make so perfect meaning and bring up the result. And we really will become as like

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:03.800
 follower of the guru and Sambhava, Buddha Hijak Devani, all those great masters. Truly,

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:11.400
 we lined up with that. We have to follow with the path. No return path. That is what we really do.

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:17.640
 That means no return to the samsara or no return to the three low rams. The hell rams,

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:27.000
 hunger ghost rams, and animal rams. We will. We have no return. One path, straight path. We are

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:34.440
 on highway of the enlightenment. Peace and harmony and joy and humble and simple, yet

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:42.680
 rich and very uplifting, very encouragement. Really, we will be. So that is bodhicitta. That is for

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:49.000
 Mahayana practicing. Not just only Sattar Mahayana and Vaidyayana Mahayana too. Bodhicitta is a

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:55.080
 foundation. With this and then above that, Vaidyayana teaching often talks. Everything is

00:10:55.080 --> 00:11:02.520
 enlightened state. Even though we don't see as enlightened, but reality, everything is

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:10.160
 enlightened and Buddha status. All the forms are enlightened. All the sound systems are enlightened

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:10.280
.

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:20.520
 And all the mind and space are enlightened. Everything enlightens state. So, since we are

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:26.840
 practicing Vaidyayana, since we are practicing Vaidyayana is what? Immediately connected to the

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:36.120
 result, the final goal. Therefore, it is called result yana. Sattar yana is kind of in the teaching

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:41.880
 state, causal yana. It takes a long time to get the result. You're working for the cause and

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:49.720
 condition, but Vaidyayana teaching is immediately to jumping to the goal of the enlightenment.

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:57.720
 That means Buddhahood, kuzhampi. So, therefore, activating those qualities, those realizations,

00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:03.160
 not just waiting. Again, it's power of the mind. When we motivated that,

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:10.280
 it will come according to the teaching. So, therefore, we should have activated those qualities

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:18.200
 as much as we can. And see, all enlightenment in the Dokki teachings, everything is,

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:28.360
 all is in the Tariqaya status. And Dharmakaya, Sambokaya, Narmakaya status. That means all

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:34.600
 subject in Dharmakaya or that Tariqaya status, and object of the eye in the Tariqaya status.

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:40.920
 There is no partitions between that. It's all in that status in the teaching state.

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:47.400
 So, activated all those visual motivations and visual thoughts. Now, we go with these teachings.

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:53.090
 Again, this teaching with those visual motivations, and now we go to the teaching. But in order to

00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:53.320
 go

00:12:53.320 --> 00:13:02.920
 teaching, again, I talked a little bit about how the teachings came. And, of course, generally,

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:08.520
 again, as I said already, is teaching of the Buddha Shakyamuni, the Great Buddha Shakyamuni,

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:16.520
 who came to Thoden about 600 years ago. He gave varieties of the teachings. What that means?

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:25.160
 Variety teachings means that everyone is not excluded. Because everyone inherited the Buddha

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:34.680
 nature, the potential enlightenment. Therefore, Buddha showed the technique and path to discovering

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:41.800
 that potential according to their readiness, and finally to discover full bloom,

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:50.280
 blooming, or bloom of the Buddhahood. That's what he taught. And for those reasons, in the teaching

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:50.280
,

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:55.320
 say, in the Nyingma schools of the Buddhism, there were about nine jhana teachings,

00:13:55.320 --> 00:14:01.480
 nine different levels of teachings. And not just even that, even before that, what Buddha gave the

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:11.200
 teaching, the teachings on the human beings and God's realms, teachings. That means what? That

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:11.640
 means

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:18.840
 because the Buddha gave the teaching that can connect with it to have the, discover the higher

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:28.760
 potentials of the, of their, their qualities to take the rebirth in the human realms, and as well

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:35.640
 as God's realms. Those other teachings said in Sanskrit word, I'm not really good at Sanskrit,

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:43.880
 but about you, that's word. Manusha yana and deva yanas. Manusha yana is human beings,

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:50.040
 and deva is God's yana. So that means what are those yanas? Those are basic goodness,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:59.640
 that was goodness. For example, for example, 10 virtues, three by the, I'm not going to release,

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:08.840
 you all know that, three by the body, four by the speech, and three by the mind, all together,

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:18.120
 known as 10 virtues, 10 virtues. Oppo said that is 10 non-virtues, that you know, 10 virtues

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:27.400
 is not just kind of an exception to the Buddhism. According to Buddhism, that is human,

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:35.000
 every human, a decent human really believes, follow with that. That's the Buddha taught.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:43.000
 That is the foundation of all the teachings. Buddha teaching is best, best on the good

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:50.680
 contract, the good nature of the way things are involved and then improved or expanded, developed.

00:15:50.680 --> 00:16:01.640
 So 10 virtues. And then to get with that, such as, and so with that, for example, those parameters,

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:09.320
 also people do those. Even non-Buddhist has parameters, not transcendental parameters,

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:15.640
 but parameters. Those are known as, also, what are those parameters? Of course,

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:22.360
 many of you already know, but generosity, moralities, patience,

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:33.480
 and joyful effort, concentration, wisdoms, they have, everyone believe those, everyone do those,

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:40.440
 everyone do generosity, everyone do good conduct, everyone talking, even the political talking

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:48.840
 conduct. This really, this all that become so popular, conduct is moralities. And then patience,

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:59.960
 patience is also tolerance, patience, those are. And then effort, effort is important.

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:07.000
 That is also mentioned. And then the concentration, let me mindfulness, now talking more

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:07.640
 mindfulness,

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:16.150
 all this. And then wisdom, knowledge, understanding those. That's why the terminology exists at

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:16.440
 every

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:24.600
 country does, because they have that. It's human value. But Buddha teaching is more expanded,

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:32.120
 more stronger, more deeper. But when we have those good qualities of human beings,

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:39.160
 what in the teaching says, it will, I mean, everything has a result, cause and result,

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:45.880
 it will bring higher rebirth in the next life. Even in this life, we will have good life,

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:56.040
 peaceful, more content, more kind of soothing lifetimes. And that result will have good rebirth

00:17:56.040 --> 00:18:03.800
 in the next life. Not three lower realms, but higher rebirth, such as human realms and God's

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:10.840
 realms. Those are really teachings. Those are known as Rigalabas. Above that, then the teaching,

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:17.400
 what in teaching, external only teachings, then such as Buddhism. Above that, then the

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:25.160
 paramata practices with best upon the transcendental paramata practices, practices.

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:32.600
 And then without those are, what means, no ego clings or no attachments and widely performing

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:38.840
 that without the discrimination, all those of Buddha's instructors in the teaching mentioned,

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:46.280
 then it become high. And that, that goes high and high and deeper and deeper. And those are

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:55.960
 known as then Kiavaka Yanas, Pathik Buddha Yanas, and as well as Bodhisattva Yanas, goes high, high

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:55.960
,

00:18:55.960 --> 00:19:01.560
 and deeper and deeper. And also the realization of those different levels,

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:09.560
 such as in human Yana or the world, the good Yanas, they didn't really talk about any emptiness,

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:20.760
 anything, nothing. But then in the Hatha Yanas, Hatha Yana, egolessiness. Those are the spiritual

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:27.400
 Buddhist teachings, egolessiness. And Pathik Buddha Yana teaching, mentioning, always teaching,

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:35.320
 he said, the egoless in the state of the subject and object, the hub of the object.

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:44.440
 I'm sorry, I think I mixed it up again. Again, and in Pathik Yana Buddha,

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:51.960
 you have the realization of the emptiness of the object and subject is hub of that,

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:59.010
 that. So there's always said emptiness, realization of the one and hubs. And in the Mahayana

00:19:59.010 --> 00:19:59.720
 teaching,

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:07.240
 then all the emptiness status. That means it's not just emptiness, completely blank status.

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:14.840
 And every true, everything is in the, as a taught teaching, as two truths, two truths,

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:23.800
 relate truth is as displays, illusion displays of the absolute truth or related true is the magic

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:35.320
 dream and reflection moon in the waters. And as well as as like dream, those are these related

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:43.640
 to the existing, but our self, the regular duality or our self, it means clinging, grasping so

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:51.640
 strongly that, but reality, it is really like illusions, not just the object is illusion,

00:20:51.640 --> 00:21:00.280
 but also mind is illusions, subject and object, all illusion status in a relative levels,

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:05.880
 all are connected. Also, so many factors, those are known as interdependent

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:13.320
 coordination, interconnectedness, or the Indian revenue, I think to be the word, the Indian revenue

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:13.400
,

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:23.720
 that all arising and each of those, then the absolute level is in the empty, empty is beyond

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:32.200
 existence or empty. There's nothing to hold, but yet it is appearing. Therefore, it's called

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:38.840
 magic display, dream-like displays. That is the Mahayana teachings. Really, I'm of course,

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:46.040
 you all know, I'm just saying those things as a reminder us to all of them. In the Mahayana

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:55.480
 teaching, then that extended, not just only that empty, but now in the teaching, explaining the

00:21:55.480 --> 00:22:02.200
 our kind of enlightened status, enlightened status on the, not just the empty, but all

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:11.320
 this display, related truth, are enlightened status. They are like medallas, those are in

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:17.560
 the teaching state. And then when you go to the inner tantrums, then you're clearly explaining

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:27.240
 song, poem is enlightened, sound is enlightened, and the mind and the space are enlightened.

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:34.600
 Absolute. And then in the Dzokhi teaching said all is a display of the ordinary nature,

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:45.320
 very clearly, strongly, ordinary nature of our mind. Each of our mind is created our perception,

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:54.200
 our conceptions, is reflecting back. So that means five aggregates, all is creation of each of our

00:22:54.200 --> 00:23:03.800
 mind or ordinary nature of the mind it created. And that creation, mind is enlightened, therefore

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:11.560
 it is creation is enlightened status. Those clearly explaining, explaining. So among these

00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:17.720
 teachings, that's what the great teacher Buddha taught. At high levels in the teaching say the

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:25.080
 teachings are taught as a staircase, staircase. All that staircase, there's nine staircase, or nine

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:31.800
 steps, one of, but the first step, the second step is dependent to the first step. Third step

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:38.760
 is dependent on the first and second step. So is it dependent? And therefore, therefore in the

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:44.760
 teaching say, said what? In the Dzokhi teacher, even, I mean that's getting, remember somebody said

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:52.680
 in the teaching, said two things from the Dzokhi teacher and student. Even you have the highest

00:23:52.680 --> 00:24:02.280
 realization, realization as like sky or the vastness of realization as a sky, yet you will observe

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:12.200
 so thoroughly and carefully all the conduct levels. So we should, great practitioners should not

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:23.720
 ignore the conduct. Then we are disturbing our realizations and making completely kind of like

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:31.000
 contradicting. And that really will make, then delay our realization. So therefore everything is

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:38.040
 enlightened state, but yet follow the exactly the same as the way things are, externally,

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:45.720
 internally. And for that reason, great master, also Nagarjuna said, if you have the good conduct

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:54.680
 of the human beings, then heaven is not far. If you are in heaven, that enlightenment or the

00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:55.400
 Nirvana

00:24:55.400 --> 00:25:03.240
 is not far. So it's all connected, all dependent. Every have done not good conduct, then we are

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:10.440
 falling back to the samsara. Even you have some of the intellectual understanding of the teachings

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:19.240
 and practices that won't really support this. So that's how all is lined up. And now we go with

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:19.720
 this,

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:27.720
 in this Dunyulungpa's teaching or this teaching where we talk is Dzogchi teachings. And Dzogchi

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:34.760
 is again, who taught this Dzogchi teaching? Again, according to Buddhism, the Buddha Shakyamuni

00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:35.080
 taught

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:43.320
 these teachings, not in the regular form Buddha appeared in India, like as with the bagging ball

00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:52.920
 and or the arms ball with that, that, that customs. Buddha, those who are highly coverabilitist,

00:25:52.920 --> 00:26:01.000
 readiness Buddha appeared in the Dharmakaya states, Buddha summoned the brothers, or Buddha

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:07.720
 registered Dara or the registered Sattva states, and then transmitted this teaching through the

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:14.440
 retinue of the Okhana, like retinue of the wisdom. Okhana, like wisdom, retinue of the

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:25.160
 wisdom, such as by Diana Buddhist, and as well as all boys, how he taught or how Buddha taught,

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:33.080
 not by word, but not by the symbolic, by the wisdom state of the mind.

00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:42.600
 My personal mind was stated, the mind transmitted without the word and the symbol, everything,

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:53.240
 of all the chimi, dongjim, unborn college, unborn colleges, Buddha transmitted,

00:26:55.400 --> 00:27:04.840
 transmitted, that teaching, those are known as mind to mind transmissions, mind to the mind,

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:13.000
 to the mind transmissions. Then also Buddha gave these teachings to the, to the Sambalar levels,

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:19.960
 against such a five Diana Buddhas. The Sambalar is also not just a kind of really big signs and

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:27.000
 Sambalar is things, but with the magically, magically through the, through the, again some

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:36.040
 indications and signs and transmitted teachings to the, to the five Diana Buddhas, and such as then

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:45.760
 Vaijapanis, Manjushiris, and, and Avalokiteshoras, all those myths, and that's how Buddha

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:46.280
 transmitted.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:52.980
 So that is known, those are known as mind to mind transmission lineage, symbolic transmission

00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:53.560
 lineage.

00:27:53.560 --> 00:28:00.680
 Those are the very special terminologies, or special, not terminologies, special systems that

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:06.760
 explained in the, in the Nyingma teachings, and those are in the Gohyangar bhatantara, or one of

00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:07.240
 the

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:14.360
 Mahayoga bhatantara, known as Hiju Jamsal, and there said how they transmitted by the mind,

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:22.360
 by the symbol, and by the A, transmitted those teachings to that. And then this order transmission

00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:30.680
 lineage is, then, for example, when that came, and it is purely teaching said, this doki teaching

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:31.000
 came

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:39.480
 28 years after Buddha's Shakyamuni's Mahapari nirvana, and then he started descending

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:46.280
 the, the doki teachings, particularly who discovered is the Garab Doji, or Garab Doji,

00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:53.720
 one who discovered or bought these doki teachings to these worlds. So then is continually that,

00:28:53.720 --> 00:29:01.320
 continually, and now the doki teaching itself is divided into three categories, and those are,

00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:09.240
 of course, we all know, but I'm talking this as, again, to, to, to gratitude of the oldest lineages

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:09.240
,

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:15.080
 lineage teachings. So therefore, again, this teaching came through the, through the, from the

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:20.760
 Garab Doji, and Garab Doji, according to the teaching, discovered they are or bought over

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:30.280
 600,000 doki teachings that he bought. And, and, and then Garab Doji's foremost student is

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:37.720
 Manjushiri Madara, and so he received all the teachings, and Manjushiri Madara divided that

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:42.920
 doki teaching into three. Of course, you all heard this so many times, and know that

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:48.760
 from, maybe from me, and as well as other great masters, I'm sure. And those are known as then,

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:58.360
 and mind sections of doki teaching, and space, and beat instructions. Those are three divided.

00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:05.560
 And Manjushiri Madara's foremost student is Hiri Sanha. And Hiri Sanha, again, received all the

00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:15.480
 teachings, and he, again, subgrouped this teaching in four different ways, particularly of this

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:23.800
 beat instruction of the teachings. Those are known as outer, inner, and cigarette,

00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:33.720
 and very cigarette, so four different. And this time, what we are practicing in this doki teaching

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:40.120
 of the Bdunya Langkwa's teaching, and all the doki, most of the doki teaching is really the,

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:47.320
 the beat instruction. Among that, not just the beat instruction, the outer, inner, cigarette,

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:53.240
 most essence. The most essence section of the teaching, that's what we really more,

00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:59.640
 our more mostly we are following that teachings. This teaching is then divided into two groups.

00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:07.080
 Those are known as Tukkyu practices and Togal practices. You all know, you, I mean, we all

00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:15.160
 heard that, Tukkyu and Togal practices. This teaching is then, where it is, those are known as,

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:25.900
 and there's 17 doki tantaras, that explaining of these, the very sacred sections of these teachings

00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:25.960
.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:34.440
 Tzokkyu doki, that's what the teachings say. And, and there is a second one, or third,

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:44.600
 another one, that the 18th one is known as tantara of the Ekajati, Ekajati teaching, and that.

00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:52.840
 And the next one is known as Lungsambharma, great blazing space section of the tantaras. So those

00:31:52.840 --> 00:32:00.120
 are total, the very powerful essence of the teaching of the 19 tantaras, of this essence,

00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:06.680
 of the essence of the doki teachings. These teachings are then translated into Tibet,

00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:13.640
 in the time of the Tresong Devtins. And who, and time of Gaurabhema Sambo,

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:22.230
 great master, Shendaraki, who both, who, who, who actually then taught these teachings. According

00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:22.280
 to

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:29.560
 Tzokkyu's history, the three great master taught, the first time, this Tzok, the innocence, the

00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:35.960
 essence of the essence teaching to the Tibetan practitioners, three, by three master, those are

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:45.670
 known as, both is Verochana, the great oscillator, and the second is, is Gaurabhema Sambo, and

00:32:45.670 --> 00:32:45.960
 third

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:53.000
 is the Vamal Matras. When they give teaching, for these doki teachings, particularly among that

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:58.920
 teaching, the first two, the mind and the space section, is particularly really taught by the

00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:07.960
 Verochanas. And then, second one, and not second one, sorry, the first and the second are taught

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:16.680
 by the Verochana, and beat as the document section teaches, and taught by the Gaurabhema Sambo and

00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:22.680
 the Vamal Matras. And those are, in the first time, Vamal Matras give the teachings,

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:29.960
 teachings, not again, with big groups, small groups, Tzokkyu Deppthi, and Nyamitung Rinzangko,

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:36.120
 or poor students, he give the teachings. And then, Gaurabhema Sambo give this teaching

00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:42.360
 to Isheem Chodja, and Tzokkyu Deppthi, and his few sons. And particularly, he entrusted

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:48.040
 one of the youngest daughter of the Tzokkyu Deppthi, passed away when he was eight years old,

00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:56.200
 but he bought by consciousness, and he trusted entirely the essence of it, sections of Tzokkyu

00:33:56.200 --> 00:34:03.960
 teachings to him, to him. So he received that, and most is hidden as thema teachings. So that's

00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:11.400
 how Tzokkyu teaching transmitted, and then it came. And then, particularly later, great master

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:19.000
 Lung Chimpa, who was emanation, or reincarnation of the youngest daughter of the consciousness

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:23.960
 who received the complete entire teaching of the Tzokkyu, the essence of essence,

00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:31.640
 essence which is known as "heart-draw of the dakinis." Khandro Ninte, true to this

00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:40.440
 youngest daughter, and Lung Chimpa discovered or received that in two things. And then, Lung

00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:48.680
 Chimpa is really known as "Second Garab Doji," or the obtibate, or Garab Doji obtibate. He

00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:56.680
 clarified, he condense it, bought everything perfectly in this section of the Tzokbit instruction

00:34:56.680 --> 00:35:05.800
 section of the Tzokkyu teachings to the students. Those are known as poor, great Tzokkyu teachings,

00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:11.400
 or essence or essence Tzokkyu teachings on Khandro Ninte. Those are the first one is

00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:16.920
 "Khandro Ninte," which is the heart essence teaching of the Garab and Masambhava. Second

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:23.320
 is known as the "Bhama Ninte," heart essence of Muramata, which is, again, Tzokkyu teaching.

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:30.360
 And then he made the commentary, which is known as "Second Lama Yante," and Khandro Yante is true.

00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:36.440
 And the essence of that, condense that one, is known as the Sammo Yante. Those teachings are

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:43.560
 Lung Chimpa taught. And what those teachings explaining is Tzokkyu and Toga practices.

00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:51.000
 Tzokkyu is cutting thoroughly, technically, of course, and Toga is leaping over practices.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:56.920
 So these two are the essence of the Pith instruction sections.

00:35:57.640 --> 00:36:06.840
 Now, this Dunyulunga's teaching is Tzokkyu teachings of both Tzokkyu and Toga teaching

00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:14.840
 practices. This contains both of these teachings, teachings. And now, what I told to do myself,

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:21.720
 and I'm going to go over these teachings, teachings specifically of the Tzokkyu sections

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:30.680
 of these teachings. Toga section teachings is the seventh chapter or the seventh section of this

00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:40.520
 Shirek Doji number of "Sha'ap Weijer awareness," and maybe I won't go over that. Because there are

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:47.160
 so many teachings, Toga teachings, already, and I just feel that I don't have really the capability

00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:54.440
 to do these Toga teachings on the internet and the Zoom. Even though I don't feel comfortable

00:36:54.440 --> 00:37:02.280
 in the capability to give Toga teachings, but so many great masters are teaching. And I just also

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:10.120
 kind of follow with and honor lineage and honor to all the great masters of this order of those

00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:17.720
 teachings. So I hope that I'm not making too much trespassing and going over really something

00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:18.200
 totally

00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:26.840
 out of range. So I will try to do my best on this tricky part of the Tzokkyu teachings, but Toga

00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:26.920
 part

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:34.990
 of the teaching, Tzokkyu teaching, as I said, I'm not going to talk over that. And as I said, I don

00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:35.000
't

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:42.200
 think so. I have capability to do this on the internet or the Zoom, so that you all know that.

00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:49.160
 I'm just going to tell that. Now Toga practice of this, sorry, Tzokkyu practices, what did the

00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:55.640
 teaching say? I'm talking, of course, the teaching will explain it, more we go through one after

00:37:55.640 --> 00:38:08.920
 another. But the essence of the Tzokkyu practices is known as will, meditation, conduct, and then

00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:17.080
 achieve the result. That is just I will highlight that now. Highlight that now that that's good for

00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:22.280
 all of us. And of course, you all know this. You all know this is not something I'm talking

00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:28.760
 new things. But since we are talking retreat and talking practice, practice of this, so it will

00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:37.640
 maybe let me remind you to continue practice of this week and then continue after the weeks.

00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:47.960
 Fourth is to recognize the will. Recognize the will is so important. It's a foundation.

00:38:49.640 --> 00:39:00.440
 And what in the teaching said? Jettawa want to innovate. Recognizing or identifying the will,

00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:07.640
 which is a foundation. What means foundation? Will is a foundation of our meditation.

00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:17.240
 Will is a foundation of our conduct. And will is dependent upon or is dependent

00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:31.240
 of our achievement, the result. So that means result and conduct and meditation all depended upon

00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:43.400
 will. A will is the mixed. Then it will mix the meditation. It will mix the mixed up, mixed up,

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:50.760
 not mixed up mixed up the meditation. It will mix up the conduct. It will mix up the result.

00:39:50.760 --> 00:40:00.680
 Therefore, will is so, so important. Therefore, it's called the foundation.

00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:13.800
 And with Jettawa want to recognize the will or identifying the will of the which is foundation.

00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:26.220
 Once you have the will found, then we have meditated. Meditation is nothing but maintaining the

00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:26.600
 will.

00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:35.160
 Conduct is nothing but improving the meditation.

00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:43.560
 And then if we are not mixed up our will, if we are not mixed up our meditation,

00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:52.280
 if we are not mixed up our conduct, then we don't have to worry not going to achieve the result.

00:40:53.240 --> 00:41:08.280
 Result comes naturally and freely, openly comes. So therefore, will is so, so important. Number one

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:08.280
.

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:14.520
 And now will, what that will. In the teaching generally they say, they

00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:24.680
 say the analytic will establish or discover the will with the analytics and throw all

00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:29.240
 discover the will through the simple technique of the pit instructions.

00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:40.440
 And this time, most of the time, we really following establish or discover the will

00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:46.360
 with the simple lineage instructions. That's what we're trying to do that most of the time.

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:56.520
 Analytic means studying all the Buddha teachings. And particularly Dzokhi teaching or particularly

00:41:56.520 --> 00:42:01.000
 those philosophical teachings, Madimaka teachings, Pandyaparamata teachings.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:11.400
 Those are explained the will. Clearly, very strongly, with logically, with reasons,

00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:17.720
 with analytically explaining. Once you started those analytically and started,

00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:26.920
 then you put that contemplations. Contemplative means you put analyzing your own intelligence,

00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:34.760
 or our own intelligence. And mind is really kind of like dividing in this discover and

00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:45.080
 discriminating and finding out exactly where the teaching said and is proving that. So that is

00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:52.680
 analytic way. And to do that, and we don't have daily times and those we like to be easy approach,

00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:59.320
 easy, quick methods. So quick method is then the pit instructions.

00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:05.320
 Pit instruction. Those are what in the teaching said. Three

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:11.320
 accurate is, or in the Tibetan, the Thema Sum.

00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:21.640
 Lamme Menga Thema and Dhamma Thema, Renga Rupa Thema. Those are the Thema in the Tibetan world,

00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:35.240
 which means that the accurate or the true, maybe Thema is, I think, maybe accurate. I'm

00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:40.440
 just going to translate it. If I found a nice kind of better world, I will let you know that in

00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:40.680
 this

00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:55.960
 video, maybe this way. Qualified lineage master, qualified instructions, and then,

00:43:55.960 --> 00:44:04.600
 and not qualified, this term, then accurate realizations, maybe these three. So qualified

00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:11.640
 lineage instruction. That means, again, lineage instruction is so important. Lineage. Because

00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:20.200
 lineage is, it means that every, those great practitioners kept the teaching exactly as it is,

00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:27.640
 without the spoiled by the intellectual, skeptical, and kind of their own analytical,

00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:34.520
 changed the world, this and that thing, and not mixed. In fact, authentic teaching, as is uttered,

00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:41.880
 uttered, or taught by the Saman Bhadara, Vajar Sattva, or Buddha Shakyamuni, and Garab Dorji,

00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:50.040
 and Garab Amma Sambaba, and Lunkimpa, that all came, exactly that same day, without changing,

00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:57.320
 without the structure, without alternating that. That is known as the qualified.

00:44:58.360 --> 00:45:04.040
 Masters who keep, or practitioners, not master, just not being the one single person,

00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:09.880
 master, maybe all trying to master of the realization, master of our knowledges of that.

00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:18.040
 So really kept that, with honor, with joy, with appreciation, not mixing our this, I want to do,

00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:26.840
 oh, it feels this, I like this, this, our feelings, our thought is not reliable, it changes.

00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:34.680
 It changes. It's not just, I'm talking that, how many thoughts and ideas changed in our lives,

00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:41.560
 in the sense beginning, we have the memories, until now, how many times changed? Really,

00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:48.120
 so many times changed. Every day is changing. It's not accurate, there's nothing to realize.

00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:55.000
 Every rely on that, and some kind of reasons of the worldly concern, of worldly, some benefit,

00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:03.640
 then we spoil, we spoil the natural. Natural, that is not correct, that is not. So therefore,

00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:11.320
 authentic teachings, teachings, or lineage qualified teachings, and then that qualified

00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:17.880
 lineage teach instructions, also authentic instructions, that we received,

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:27.480
 authentic receipts, as we received, then one's own intelligence, one's own mind, put that,

00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:35.240
 and got it, got meaning on that. That is called Ranga Rupatshema. Ranga Rupatshema,

00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:44.120
 I want our own knowledge, really proved. That is, that is the simple technique

00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:53.880
 that discovered the view, view, Rupatshema. How they do that? That is then in this teaching,

00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:59.400
 explaining, on the teaching explaining, and we all received so many times, this is so key teaching.

00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:05.960
 We are not going to go the outskirts of the, to Australia, through the, from the outskirts,

00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:13.560
 gradually coming to the center. We are going to go the center of the bull's eye. That means what?

00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:22.040
 Center of the bulls eye of the universe or the world is our own mind. Our own mind is a center.

00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:32.520
 What that means? Everything what we see around, that is outer. The mind is the center. Your mind,

00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:41.320
 each of our mind is a center. Central, it is essential. So discover the view from the mind.

00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:49.560
 How that discovered that? Those are then the teaching mentioned. Where is the mind symbolism?

00:47:49.560 --> 00:48:01.800
 Where is the mind? Those are said, where mind is coming? Where is mind? Where is mind going or when

00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:01.800
?

00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:13.240
 Every we look this past the person in the future, all three times are no answer. We become the

00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:25.800
 answer less. Speak less. That is view. Believe it or not, view is not something that we have to

00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:26.120
 hold

00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:33.640
 tangible things. If we hold something tangible, we don't find the view. That's it. If we don't

00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:44.120
 find anything, we speak less stateless, like center of the sky. Then we ponder. For that reason,

00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:51.960
 great teacher, Buddha said in the teaching, when you don't see anything, that is supreme seeing.

00:48:52.600 --> 00:49:00.440
 When talking in the view, I'm talking about Tomo Cho. You see the supreme. You really see the

00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:09.720
 supreme when you don't see. That means subject and object are merged. There's nothing. That's

00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:21.240
 discovered the view from the instructions of the lineage teachings. And then we also prove that.

00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:26.200
 That means our intelligence, we're talking this, we're not talking that it's methodologically or

00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:35.640
 somewhere else that we, our own intelligence proves there's nothing we can say about the mind.

00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:43.480
 We did not find. It's not something we did not find because we like to not find.

00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:53.080
 Buddha said, or because we did not find, because I like to be polite. That's not at all. Really,

00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:58.680
 we don't find. It's true. That is you proving. That means each of us proving.

00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:08.360
 That's it. That is not just we prove. That's what Buddha said. That's when Guru Pramma sambha said,

00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:16.040
 that was all those lineage master, all the Nagarjuna, sixth ornament of the Jambudip's

00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:22.920
 world, really said all those things. And all the 25 disciples of Mgurubhema sambha said.

00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:27.480
 And all the great master of all the schools of the Muslims,

00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:35.320
 they're so scholars, so intellectuals. They're thinkers. They're not just the believers.

00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:41.800
 Really, they have, in modern time, we can say they all like the best of the Physicists.

00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:49.080
 The Physicists, that's the discovery of the inner spaces, not just externals,

00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:56.840
 external and everything. They proved one after another. They sealed one after another.

00:50:56.840 --> 00:51:06.120
 It's true. There's nothing to find. That is reality. When we discover that god of this,

00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:13.000
 then that's what they called samsara nirvana. It's a joke, big jokes. There's nothing really

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:20.120
 conflict, anything. It's like we can hold. But yet everything's functioning. Everything's,

00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:26.200
 nothing is changed on the relative levels. That's the beauty, the magical disciplines.

00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:37.640
 Fulfill all that. So that is, when we recognize that, then we keep up that. Those are in this

00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:45.720
 teaching explaining. Keep up all the teachings. See, we keep up that teaching with all the

00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:51.080
 relative levels and as up to levels. This is the absolute level we're talking. Just now,

00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:57.640
 not finding, all that. But relative level, everything's. For that reason, great master,

00:51:57.640 --> 00:52:05.000
 what the Taloba said to Naropa, even you got the highest realizations or realizations.

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:18.360
 I think this is maybe not Naropa. This, of course, Naropa said that, but it's great master,

00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:24.680
 sara said that. Even you got the highest realizations of the unborns, but never,

00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:31.320
 never ignored the meritorious activities. Or that means six paramata practices.

00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:39.720
 That even you got highest realizations, not ignoring. For that reason, for example,

00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:46.440
 the greatest teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni, he has highest realization in the Buddhism. There's

00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:54.920
 nothing higher than him. But he, how much he is humble, simple, following in the giving teaching

00:52:54.920 --> 00:53:02.040
 and explaining to the, guiding to the other students with good conduct, good meditation.

00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:09.400
 And the Buddha himself doing the same thing. In the teaching said that Buddha went to the city

00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:18.040
 and with mong and got the arms or the food and returned back to the hermitage, hermitage,

00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:25.880
 and cleaned the feet. That means bare feet Buddha is walking on the ground, ground with the old

00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:35.160
 students and come back. The hermitage whacked the feet and then he meditated. He's meditated.

00:53:36.440 --> 00:53:44.520
 Even though Buddha reach already in light state, but to show to us how important to maintain the

00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:51.800
 meritorious activities and respect the relative levels. Levels. Those are really teachings.

00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:58.680
 Teaching. And then all those great masters, we read life stories one after another, really.

00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:08.680
 Even they got highest realization. That is what. So now, again, go back to the, to this. Suppose

00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:19.240
 recognizing, recognizing or identify of the will. That is, so that, I mean, I'm just, you all know,

00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:25.160
 know this, but this is, again, to do this, even you got the realization, even you didn't completely

00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:32.600
 settle on that way. But supportive of the meritorious activities, such as devotion, bodhicitta,

00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:37.640
 all those so important, really devotion to the lineage, devotion, the teaching,

00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:44.600
 devotion to Dharma or Buddha, Dharma, Sangha is so important. And this is like that. Not just

00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:51.240
 devotion, okay, but sizzling devotion in heart and mind will bring the sizzling

00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:58.600
 realizations and achievements. That is, so not just a kind of this devotion is extra things. No,

00:54:58.600 --> 00:55:04.680
 it's so important that when you have the devotion, that means we are settled on the ground,

00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:12.440
 not wondering. We are not lingering. We're not just a bit unstable, shaky. We settled the

00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:19.240
 separation ground. Now we feel so joy and appreciate confidence and feel the richness of this. And

00:55:19.240 --> 00:55:19.720
 then

00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:27.720
 that's the devotion. Really appreciate them. Feel that from the heart. Sit down. And then when you

00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:36.360
 got that, then maintain the view is meditation. As I said early, and you know, meditation is not

00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:36.760
 any

00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:46.760
 extra. Maintain the view. Those are in the teaching said, said, "Mew some unshakable,

00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:53.640
 not shaky body." So that means good postures where you meditate, particularly in big time,

00:55:53.640 --> 00:56:04.600
 time, not shaky, not wondering of our senses, and then not shaky of our awareness. Relax,

00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:14.120
 calm and peaceful. Those are, we keep maintaining the view, keeping the view.

00:56:16.280 --> 00:56:23.160
 Once you have maintained that view with that way, and then the improve by the conduct,

00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:31.880
 conduct is not just on the side that on the distance. Conduct is right with the practitioners.

00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:41.160
 Conduct will boost the realization, boost the achievements. If you don't keep the conduct,

00:56:41.160 --> 00:56:48.920
 it will delay, it will mix up our meditation and our realizations. So therefore, conduct.

00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:54.900
 And the Dzokhi teaching, what is the best conduct? The great Master Baburul Mooji said in the

00:56:54.900 --> 00:56:55.240
 teaching,

00:56:55.240 --> 00:57:03.720
 again, I'm not just saying, but really said, stop liberating. Stop liberating. That means

00:57:04.520 --> 00:57:12.840
 when any thought and the conception comes, liberate it. What that means? Let it go.

00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:22.200
 If we don't let it go, that means we're holding. What we're holding? We're holding the samsara.

00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:29.080
 We're holding samsara, really. We're trying to hold that samsara. What that means, samsara,

00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:38.120
 because what comes in thought is a duality mind, dualities. Dualities are connected with

00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:44.680
 negative emotions, ignorance, attachment, anger, or maybe beats of those all different things.

00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:54.520
 That is duality, attachment, or whatever. If we hold that, we are maintaining the samsara.

00:57:55.480 --> 00:58:01.880
 We like to liberate the samsara. Liberate to what? In the Dzokhi teaching, I said that the dharma

00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:10.760
 kaya or the three kaya status. So liberate it. Who's going to liberate it? Nobody else is going

00:58:10.760 --> 00:58:20.440
 to liberate. What in the teaching said? Stop liberating. It means you or your mind, well,

00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:28.840
 let it go. Where'd it come from? All those thoughts and feelings. From mind. And we hold

00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:34.680
 by mind. And we let it go by mind. That's called self-liberating.

00:58:34.680 --> 00:58:43.000
 And then, in order to do that, what in the teaching said? Mindfulness.

00:58:44.840 --> 00:58:51.880
 Without too much effort, without too much forceful, relax the atmosphere with mindfulness.

00:58:51.880 --> 00:58:59.240
 Or samsara and the Dzokhi teaching, what we mentioned, original natural mind, not with

00:58:59.240 --> 00:59:08.360
 clinging, grasping. Keeping that flavour or that light in the meditation and relax.

00:59:10.120 --> 00:59:15.240
 Then we are really good practitioners, according to the teachings. And we are able to maintain that

00:59:15.240 --> 00:59:15.240
.

00:59:15.240 --> 00:59:23.240
 And the post-meditation or along that, as I said, both each other devoting, sizzling devotions

00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:30.760
 and sizzling both each others. Even during the meditation, meditation or Dzokhi, bring up

00:59:30.760 --> 00:59:37.240
 sizzling devotions, sizzling both each other for a few seconds or a few minutes, and then let it go

00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:37.240
.

00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:43.560
 Not lingering that again. Even if it's devoting, even if the body is not lingering on that,

00:59:43.560 --> 00:59:47.240
 let it go relaxing again. Same nature.

00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:56.840
 Natural state of mind. Those are the essence, heart, centre column of the Dzokhi meditation

00:59:56.840 --> 01:00:03.480
 that you all know, as I said, the mind. Now we go back again to this teaching. The

01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:09.000
 teaching of this, again, is Dunyulungkwa. How many of you already know Dunyulungkwa?

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:18.680
 I talk really, again, this Dunyulungkwa. Dunyulungkwa is one of the great

01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:27.960
 masters or the Mahasiddhas, the Tertungs and the Virginaries. To be the Buddhist history,

01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:33.240
 all of these are Buddhist stories. Really one of them. And also, Kredi was the master. Kredi was

01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:33.320
 the

01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:41.640
 master. He was Mahasiddha, lay practitioners, every siddha, that. And he was born, I think,

01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:57.080
 around 1835. 1835. And he entered Mahaparin nirvana around 1904. He entered Mahaparin nirvana.

01:00:57.960 --> 01:01:04.760
 And the teaching said that, I mean, this is his own world. He said, "Until age nine,

01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:12.600
 nine, I was nurtured by so many Western rakinis,

01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:21.720
 so many Western rakinis, nurtured as a mother." So that. But in the teaching, the life story,

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:27.160
 of course, I'm sure maybe you already read that, and it has so many visions, so many really, like,

01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:36.760
 he has magical displays, marvelous displays that you cannot think that. He performed so many things

01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:44.040
 when he was, in a few years old, dead and continuous. And around age nine,

01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:51.880
 nine or the two, the age, even in his own world, he received so many, many

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:59.640
 empowerment, transmissions, teachings from many of those, in like, Buddhas, in Bodhisattvas.

01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:04.680
 And those are the ladies, the Buddhas, and the Sarajas, Garabham, Sambhavas. And

01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:12.280
 Awalokteshora, Majapani, I mean, really, those all great masters, great Buddhas, one after another,

01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:24.360
 you see. Around age, like, in the age, yeah, around age, in early 20s, maybe I shall say,

01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:32.680
 early 20s, until age 30, mid 30s, then he started discovering so many Thelma teachings,

01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:41.160
 one after another. Those Thelma teachings are visionary teachings, and the art or the,

01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:47.880
 from the object, the Thelma teachings, as well as from his verse remind Thelma teachings.

01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:56.600
 So he become the master of the rule of the Thelma discoveries. And from that onward,

01:02:56.600 --> 01:03:03.080
 then he were doing so many teachings and task meetings to the students, one after another,

01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:13.400
 until age 69. So those are the, really, he mentioned this, I said that. And then he was also one of

01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:13.560
 the,

01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:22.520
 he was the reincarnation or actually reincarnation of the many great masters in previous lifetimes.

01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:28.760
 He was born as so many great teenage masters or masters. And that first one is in the teaching

01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:35.720
 set. The Nudin Dorje is the very beginning of this one thousand Buddha. Buddha, and that is

01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:46.120
 Nudin Dorje. He was born as Nudin Dorje, master Nudin Dorje. He introduced, encouraged one thousand

01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:53.160
 bodhisattvas, and that's what they all developed the bodhisattva, and it is teaching from that

01:03:53.160 --> 01:04:01.000
 own world. This one thousand bodhisattva become the one thousand Buddhas of these fortunate eons

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:09.400
 that many of you know. And during the Buddha's time, he was born as the great Shari putters.

01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:15.480
 And the Buddha's, the Buddha has so many great arathas, disciples, those who are arathas. But

01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:23.720
 among all the arathas in the Buddha, highly praised in the groom, that Shari putter is,

01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:31.960
 had the supreme power of the wisdom among all these students. So that he was born as Shari putters.

01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:38.440
 And then also Shari putter become the instrumentals of the Pandya Paramata teachings. He was like,

01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:45.240
 in the Buddha, in the, will give the one hundred thousand Buddha teachings of the Pandya Paramata,

01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:52.120
 and Shari putter was like, many times his dialogue, dialogue, or question and answer with Buddha,

01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:58.840
 to explore the profound teaching of the Pandya Paramata teachings. Anyway, along with that,

01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:04.920
 such as the condensed and hard Pandya Paramata teaching, is hard suttas. And hard suttas is

01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:11.480
 also, but Shari putter was the instrumentals to come, have these hard suttas teachings,

01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:18.760
 along with our lokthi choras that you, that. So, and in the time of the Gaurabhamma Sambhai,

01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:23.640
 at the century, a time of the great Master Shandarak in the Trasondi of the time,

01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:33.320
 and Shari, he's the new lungwa, was born as Chhechung Lhota. Chhechung Lhota. And in the teaching,

01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:39.640
 said that, that his sign of realization is he, through his meditation, and through his

01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:50.840
 power of compassion, the birds land so pretty, what's called, very friendly on his fingertips,

01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:56.600
 and which we have here illustrations. Every time illustrations of the 25 disciples,

01:05:56.600 --> 01:06:05.000
 Chhechung Lhota is lay practitioners, and disciple of the Gaurabhamma Sambhai and Shandarakita,

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:14.200
 and lay practitioners holding the bird on his finger as his pinkles. His power of his realization

01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:20.360
 is powerful loves. When you have a compassion of love, loving kindness to all the sentient beings,

01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:26.600
 then everyone become friend. They not feel unkind of friendlies that they call the teaching. So,

01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:32.760
 that really is. And then he took so many different emanations, one after another. Or before that,

01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:42.040
 also in India, he was born Hongkaras, very famous yogi and a master of the Yanda Heruka,

01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:50.840
 among the, at Heruka, the Yanda Heruka, Hongkaras, and as well as the Saras in the teaching said.

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:58.520
 And then, as then, also, after the Chhechung Lhota and before the the Dunyulunga, and then he

01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:05.080
 born so many great masters in the, in Tibet, really talk many, and some lay practitioners,

01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:13.000
 some among, such as Rongmu Chhuyi Janpakwa, as like very famous great master of the Sajja,

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:19.240
 among the five great masters, Rongmu Chhuyi Janpakwa, and as well as then,

01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:25.480
 and Rongmu Tsangpa Jari of the Gaju, one of the Rokpa Gaju masters, and Trump Jim Khanna,

01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:32.040
 Heba Acheem Jung, and so many, I mean, you can read, the Chinese life, praise of the life story

01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:38.040
 of the, his own Dunyulunga of the Dunyulunga, you can read all those. And then, one of the foremost

01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:38.040
,

01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:46.920
 again, great thetungs, reincarnation was the Dordi, poor Dunyulunga, very famous,

01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:54.360
 really thetung, the Dordis. And then, then, Dunyulunga was born, so this is the what,

01:07:54.360 --> 01:08:01.800
 Dunyulunga. And then, after that, Dunyulunga went into the Mahapari Nirvana, and then one

01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:09.560
 was really renowned, very famous one is his own Dunyulunga. But, however, I mean, that was,

01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:17.480
 he's also predicted by, in his visionary teachings, and he said, because Ekachati asked how many

01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:17.800
 your

01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:24.120
 lives do you talk past, and how many times you will take in the future, Ekachati asked in the

01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:29.720
 visionary, he answered in the visionary, and he said, I mentioned many of those, one after another,

01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:36.920
 I said those. And in the future, I will be reappeared again in the southern part of the Tibet,

01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:46.840
 and who will transform that area in the virtuous countries. So, truly, he was predicted upcoming

01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:54.760
 his, his own Dunyulunga. But then, Dunyulunga, also generally, when he entered Mahapari Nirvana,

01:08:54.760 --> 01:09:02.600
 he has five emanations, came, came around the same time, born, and those are, in the teaching

01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:11.720
 mentioned, body emanations, speech emanations, mind emanations, call, call it emanations,

01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:19.880
 as well as activity emanations. Among that, his whole Dunyulunga, on Jigbrachi Dhoji,

01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:28.280
 it was, was the mind emanation of the Dunyulunga, and which the many of you know,

01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:34.120
 and what is the teachings, and we become, who become the, one of the really famous, great

01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:41.400
 masters, Tetungs, that. And then, Dunyulunga, as he said, early, he was late practitioner,

01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:50.920
 Singapore. So, he has also many children. Among that, he has eight sons. Eight sons all become

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:58.120
 great masters, great at, really, all of them. Even he said, many, some, many people, you say,

01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:06.840
 he has the eight sons as emanation of the eight bodhisattvas. Among that, the very famous one

01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:13.880
 is Thar Dhotrapchim, the Thar Dhotrapchim, who become really one of the famous, great

01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:23.240
 masters, masters of Thar Dhotrapchim, and then many of others, eight sons, sons. Among that is,

01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:30.760
 then, Truko Temi Hozars, or Truko Temis, and the Dandars, Dorje Dandars, one of them, maybe,

01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:40.360
 eight sons, who become, also, root teacher to the, his wholeness, Chhabra Rambuchi, that many

01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:49.800
 of you know, who say this, like, over 100 years, maybe 104, 100 years. So, that is, so that is

01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:57.640
 Dunyulunga, as a son. And then, his old teachings are connected, as there were over 20 volumes,

01:10:57.640 --> 01:11:06.840
 or 22 volumes. Among that, mostly popular, famous one is, I mean, not, maybe not just only that,

01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:07.320
 but

01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:14.760
 the Tumma, Black Tumma practices, Tumma Nama practices, is really the very famous. It is also

01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:23.160
 western mind tenmas, mind tenmas, kunter. And so, it's very, it's become so popular, not very

01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:28.760
 so popular, because it's so powerful, and so many benefits, uplifting. And in the teaching,

01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:39.640
 in pretty quickly, through the, this Tumma practices, there is 13 individually well-achieved

01:11:39.640 --> 01:11:46.120
 transcendental western rainbow bodies. Those are really great master's codes, that. And then,

01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:53.480
 so many countless are practitioner of calm. Those are pretty, that is true. Tumma becomes so

01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:53.880
 popular,

01:11:53.880 --> 01:12:01.800
 so powerful practices. Tumma is a Black, Vayyavarayi practice, or the Vayyavarayi practices,

01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:02.440
 practices.

01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:11.950
 And so, this also commonly known as Choo practice, Choo, Choo practice, and in this Choo practice

01:12:11.950 --> 01:12:12.120
 is

01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:19.480
 a very famous lineage, teachings in the Tibetan Buddhism. So Choo practices, that. So, and then,

01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:25.960
 as well as many Dzokhi teachings, Namjang is that. So, that is really talk, and now,

01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:32.760
 I go one short time, then I'm going to stop here too. But then, now, this is, now we go with it.

01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:48.520
 That today, I say this Dzokhint kind of essence of Dzokhint instructions, is not just, I said,

01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:53.800
 but is there really more coming in these teachings that you already know those things. So,

01:12:53.800 --> 01:13:00.200
 but I thought, because it is, it's kind of, let us big text, or not, I mean, not big, big,

01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:06.200
 but it's a big thing. So, maybe to reach to those stages, we will take a lot of time. So, I thought

01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:06.200
,

01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:11.880
 maybe, those who are kind of a little bit new, or particularly, I mean, we like to meditate. It is

01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:17.480
 sound a little more meditative, activate it. So, I thought to tell that maybe somebody will help,

01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:25.000
 but that's my consumption. Thought maybe help to tell that. So, I said those, recognize the view,

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:32.120
 and maintain the meditation, and then liberating technique of the contrast, and

01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:38.680
 with all the effort of the mindfulness, those are mentioned there. So, but this is what's coming in

01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:44.710
 Dzokhint. And now, we go just this short one, and the short, I mean, just then, of course, we go

01:13:44.710 --> 01:13:44.920
 talk

01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:53.160
 about this a little bit more, as much as we can. So, this title is, and translated, this here,

01:13:53.160 --> 01:14:01.800
 From the Net of the Pure Awareness and Premodural Wisdom, the Premodural Pure Expense of the Sum

01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:01.880
 and

01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:09.410
 the Badri, the Sapantenas, a Complicate Treasury of Dzokhint, the Shavwajara of the Awareness Tant

01:14:09.410 --> 01:14:09.960
ra,

01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:16.600
 the Contrasts of the Great Secretary of Mantryana. So, those are titles. I think you, you know,

01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:26.200
 you see that. Those are all titles. First, in it a bit, I mean, I go with two items here, so,

01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:33.720
 as much as I can. And, but then it will cover this, this meaning. First, it is, here I said, pure

01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:40.120
 vision, and first one is what, if I translate it, kamai, direct kamai, kind of broken English, that

01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:40.120
,

01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:50.520
 from the nets of the illusion of the purity, pure perception of pure. That's my kind of direct

01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:58.120
 translation of these things. So, now it's said pure perceptions. So, this teaching

01:14:58.120 --> 01:15:07.240
 come from as pure perceptions. What is this teaching is? In the category of the, in the

01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:14.840
 according Numa. In the Numa teaching is divided into two sections, or the way the, I mean,

01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:19.880
 teaching is not just that, with practice, a part of the Numa teaching is divided in

01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:28.440
 two sections, kamai and tenmaa, that many of you know. Kamaa means the order transmission.

01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:38.040
 Order transmission, that means from the master to the student, from the master to the student,

01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:41.880
 or from the practitioner to the practitioner to the practitioners,

01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:51.000
 continue created as normal, regular channel in the world we do. Teacher taught the student,

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:57.080
 and that become the teacher, and taught to the others, and then continually that, so that is called

01:15:57.080 --> 01:16:06.200
 oral. Again, oral is, as I said, it's not just diluted by the different conceptions, adding

01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:13.080
 throughout generations. As I said, lineage teaching, preserved, keep the integrity, call

01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:20.520
 it, up exactly as it is. And always in the teaching said that, teaching is natural,

01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:29.000
 teaching is stainless, teaching is like refined purified water, which has add colitis,

01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:41.720
 kept that continually. Why? Because this teaching is taught to clear with the emotions, clear with

01:16:41.720 --> 01:16:52.200
 obscurations, clear with negative emotions, emotions such as ignorance, attachment, anger,

01:16:52.200 --> 01:17:04.620
 jealous, and hated thoughts, arrogance, skeptical. And that skeptical, that emotion is never

01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:05.160
 changed

01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:15.240
 from the time of the Buddha, and until now, which ending things are changed, or our poems are

01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:15.720
 changed,

01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:25.480
 but our emotions stay the same, maybe adding more stronger, stronger and stronger. So therefore,

01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:33.080
 the chain of the, chain of our consciousness of this duality, mind never changed.

01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:45.400
 Our poem of the body changed, it's a lifetime, but mind stays, but this emotion, talking. So this

01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:52.760
 teaching clarified, purified that time, and this time, it's no need to add anything that,

01:17:52.760 --> 01:18:01.720
 every added more is consumption, dualities. Duality add more dualities,

01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:11.320
 and the emotion add more emotions, it won't. So therefore, in the teaching always that

01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:19.240
 authenticness of the lineage teaching preserve is so important. And also in the teaching said,

01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:26.280
 teacher, qualified teachers, one who keep the, qualified teacher is one who keeping the lineage

01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:35.560
 teaching exactly as said. For that reason, great master Shanti Deva said, what is the qualification

01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:46.040
 of the, the qualification of the bodhisattva, or qualification of the teacher of the bodhisattva

01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:55.400
 jhana or Mahayana? One who keep the vows on the bodhisattva perfectly, and they even the

01:18:55.400 --> 01:19:04.120
 cost relax, cost relax, never give up the vows of the bodhisattva. That is the qualified master,

01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:11.720
 teacher of the bodhisattva jhanas. Really simplified, simple, short, short. So that is,

01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:18.440
 and also qualified student. And the teaching is one who keep the teaching exactly as it is.

01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:28.200
 That is qualified teachers, exactly as it is with that. So therefore, therefore, these teaching in

01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:35.640
 the nimma kamma is, that is how preserved kamma teachings continue. Thelma teaching is, has

01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:43.480
 three, three thelma teachings. Thelma means hidden, discovered. And that is, thelma is then,

01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:53.000
 that many of you know, thelma. And then there is second teaching is, is mind thelma. And then pure

01:19:53.000 --> 01:20:01.240
 vision. So three different. Thelma is a thelma, and that many indicating thelma, that hidden by the

01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:07.400
 gurup and the sambhava, what's in recognition. Soja, on the rocky mountain, in the lake, on the

01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:07.880
 tree,

01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:15.880
 on the earth, through their magical powers, what's the power hidden, and then connect with those

01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:24.680
 beings, rediscover those teachings, or those treasures, as the kind of named thelma, popular.

01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:32.920
 Then mind thelma, guntara, in the spirit of guntara, what that means, mind thelma.

01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:38.680
 That means, the gurup and the sambhava, hidden, that thelma teaching,

01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:47.560
 teaching to the mind streams of those individualists. What that means, mind system.

01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:53.720
 Gurup and thelma sambhava did not heeded thelma teaching to the duality mind systems.

01:20:53.720 --> 01:21:00.360
 But the gurup and thelma sambhava were heeded to the old and the absolute mind,

01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:05.640
 all these like, darshan yung guo, dathanga, the garbage state of the individual.

01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:14.520
 That is thelma. It's not conceptual level. Why conceptual level? Because conceptual changes.

01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:22.840
 That is unstable. It dilute it. But once you hidden this, for example, his own union, which

01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:33.880
 discovered this magical eye teaching, he teaching, what in the vision in teaching said that he was

01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:41.720
 integral nest in the Bhutan, that in his practice, practicing, in the dream, young lady came,

01:21:41.720 --> 01:21:49.080
 in the mind appears is lishim sahaja. She pulled him from the hand.

01:21:49.080 --> 01:21:57.080
 Hand, that you remember, that you received the entirely teaching of the off,

01:21:58.040 --> 01:22:05.560
 teachings of the teachings on the guru and teachings on the dukkin and magical eye teaching

01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:12.680
 in it is it and hidden in your western mind that you remember, she pulled up

01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:21.240
 and handed all over purpose. That's it. So that is that. Remember, it's not that he's

01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:27.560
 only discovered that from his external duality mind. I'm sure he don't have the duality, but

01:22:27.560 --> 01:22:34.680
 it's hidden the Twitter with his absolute city of tathagabha state. That's what his whole

01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:41.480
 journey discovered. It's an indestructible state discovered. So that is known as mind term.

01:22:41.480 --> 01:22:48.120
 That is and he also discovered and many of Yumi Lang Kwa's teachings are also known as

01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:56.840
 gundar. So it's not duality status. It's a state discovered and a tang thing in a Tibetan and a

01:22:56.840 --> 01:23:04.520
 translated in English, I'm translating as a pure perception or pure appearance. Pure appearance is

01:23:04.520 --> 01:23:10.520
 also really good. Pure appearance, pure appearance. So this pure appearance, what that means,

01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:17.000
 it's not just those have highest realization. Those have the realization their appearance

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:23.960
 become the pure. It's not just occasionally pure perception comes and then comes goes away

01:23:23.960 --> 01:23:30.600
 and come back to as we see things. It is really seeing the way things are.

01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:39.000
 What that means the way things are? All is enlightened status. All is enlightened.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:48.120
 All in the nature is enlightened as we see it. That's what we visualize. Everything is

01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:55.160
 enlightened status. Even though it's a visualize this economy in the way imagination way,

01:23:55.160 --> 01:24:00.680
 but that is lined up the way things are. That's why we're in the visualization world walk.

01:24:02.360 --> 01:24:11.960
 Then it brings the reality goal where we think. So this is not just occasionally comes and then

01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:19.640
 goes away. He is his realization. Those were seeing everything purely status.

01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:27.160
 This is standard Buddhism teaching. When you reach higher realization boomies one after another,

01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:35.160
 your purity external is changes. When as we think change inwardly improve and purify the

01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:43.560
 obscurations and things external also change as like our jaundices. When you have the jaundice

01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:50.440
 problems, we don't see things exactly we could see. But when the jaundice is a clearing way

01:24:50.440 --> 01:24:57.080
 and things will become clay and clay and clay, this is not just occasionally arising.

01:24:57.480 --> 01:25:03.080
 Clay and clay. But at the end time we are have the jaundice of the dualities

01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:10.440
 that blocking our reality view or nature views. But then you look up

01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:18.680
 his view is it's pure. That's it. But I mean and then what happened is when Buddha see everything

01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:24.840
 so clearly and beautiful perfectly exactly where things are. So then Buddha is always a pure way.

01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:31.720
 No, Buddha see where things are as his way and Buddha see where things we see.

01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:41.080
 That's why Buddha give the teachings and guide support to us. That's called beauty and the power

01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:48.200
 of the enlightenment qualities. So this is the come from that teaching teaching teaching and

01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:54.230
 that's my breach of the protruding and thank you very much everyone again for participating thank
