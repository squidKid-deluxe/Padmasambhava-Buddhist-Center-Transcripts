00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.820
 'Virgama Sambhava' is a practice that we all touch to the many great masters of all schools of the

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:08.560
 Buddhism.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:15.850
 From the to the like, 'Nimma', of course, 'Dhānimma' and 'Sajjana' or 'Gadam' or the 'Galu'

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:17.920
 schools of the very Buddhism.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.760
 Or any other sub-schools of the Buddhism.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:28.560
 When we need light sort of those great masters of all those schools, then we can really find how V

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.760
irgama Sambhava,

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.920
 touched the Buddhism to all those great masters, because of the Buddhism of Virgama Sambhava,

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:42.840
 their realization, their understanding and as well as their activities completely come all closed

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.160
 without any big obstacles, every those great masters of the nation.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.760
 And so that is what really Virgama Sambhava.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.280
 And Virgama Sambhava also himself, you say, is not something that Virgama Sambhava, who came and

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.280
 then gone.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:04.640
 It is not that. He is always here, and in his teaching said, and as well as many of those great

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:05.200
 masters,

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:11.270
 one after another said, Virgama Sambhava is not something that came and gone, but whoever practiced

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.280
, whoever meditated,

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:19.120
 whoever do some good activities, Virgama Sambhava is always there to support, to inspire and to

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.280
 help to our activities of the goodness.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.440
 And that is what really teaching said, and that is what the great masters said, and that is what

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.280
 everyone says.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.280
 And that is what Virgama Sambhava is.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.350
 So therefore, again, Virgama Sambhava is a very special Buddha of this present time, of the Dijana

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.280
 Vedic time,

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.280
 and by of course all the time, but by people of all these times.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.840
 And every also great master often said, Virgama Sambhava is one of the very swept Buddhas of the D

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.280
ijana Vedic times,

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:56.280
 when we need it more, when we have more difficult troubles in that time, Virgama Sambhava is here.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:03.360
 And again, in the many great masters you see, among all the male Buddhas, Virgama Sambhava is a

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.280
 swept Buddhas.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.280
 Among all the female Buddhas, Tara is a swept Buddhas of the Dijana Vedic times.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.280
 That is what they said. So this is the Virgama Sambhava, and Virgama Sambhava,

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.280
 very, very important and special Buddhas all the time.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.280
 And then again, this practice, this teaching is in the world by Thaso Mumba,

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:32.280
 as we said yesterday, from the Samyachibu morning, or sorry, Samyachibu morning.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:38.280
 As he is in the world, then he is teaching to the students.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:46.980
 And therefore, this Thema teaching is known as a very short-distance lineage, or very close lineage

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:47.280
.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:55.280
 So Thema teaching comes very close. For example, the lineage comes from Virgama Sambhava,

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.280
 this teaching, Yishimsojaya, and then the people themselves, or they do so,

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:06.280
 in the time of the Virgama Sambhava, Yishimsojaya, in the 8th century, such as Samyachibu.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:15.280
 Virgama Sambhava, and Western Rakhine Yishimsojaya, and the Sangye Yishim, and then Thaso Mumba.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.280
 All Virgama Sambhava, Yishimsojaya, and then to the Thaso Mumba.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:26.280
 So Thaso Mumba, then, they quite prove monasteries in the Tibet,

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.280
 particularly in the Eastern Tibet, that practice Thaso Mumba teachings,

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.280
 known as in the Boa area, in the southern Tibet, of the Eastern Tibet, there's Boa area,

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.280
 there's one monastery. In our region, in our region, there's small, many,

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.280
 quite few small monasteries who hold this lineage teaching.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:52.280
 Among them, then, Gochi monastery is considering the big monasteries in these lineage schools.
