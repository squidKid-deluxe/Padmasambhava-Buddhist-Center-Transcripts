00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.500
 It is difficult to meditate as an exotic status and then it is important to start with shamatha.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.000
 Shamatha should do that more, even in one session of the practices.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 At the beginning of the session, for example, start with bodhicapa, start with devotion,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 start with all this as you have time, and then with the Kundal practices, all guru yoga practices.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 After that, do short meditation, do shamatha meditations.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 When you have the shamatha, stabilise your mind more and then go to the Dzogic state of the mind.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 That means, shamatha, you are going to hold something, you are going to concentrate on something.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 You are going to stay with that concentrated object and that is supported.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 That means the mind is anchored to that concentrated object.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 When you are a little bit more stabilising your mind or your mind at that time,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 then release that object of concentration and go to the Dzogic meditation.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 That is more practical and more stable.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 If you are a little bit younger, you will be able to concentrate on something.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 When you meditate, you will concentrate on shamatha meditations.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 In any case, even your concentrated object is that kind of concentrated object.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 In any case, you can't concentrate. You sometimes can feel, "Oh, I can do meditation.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 I think meditation is not going to happen to me. You can be tired, you can be bored."

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 That even can happen because the mind is so agitated or so active.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 Even if that happens, you shouldn't feel bad with that.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 That is the first time we are noticing or individualism noticing how mind is restless.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 Our mind may be like that all the time, but we never notice it.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 Notice that now because of the concentration, we are noticing.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 Therefore, we don't have to feel bad about that.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 This is what we need this time.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 At that time, we need more courage, more confidence, more joy, more bodhicata, more devotion.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 See, this is precious. This is all precious, so special.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 "I have to do this. I am going to do this."

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 This is all so special.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 Again applying some review of those renomences and put the renomences and those teachings

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 or looking to the nugget nature of this phenomenal existence,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 reactivate our courage and commitment and do continually meditate.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 Again, when you meditate and concentrate, such as now we are talking shamatha,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 shamatha little bit of shamatha meditation.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 Again, in some cases, mind is running so much, running with junk.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 Those who are generally in the meditation instructions say

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 it is a sign of the slow down of our mind.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 Even it looks like running so fast, it is slowing down.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 Therefore, in the teaching here, the renomencer says

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 there are five different stages that we go through.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 This is also the famous instruction of the great doki master, Umar Mater,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 that he also go here. This is his teaching.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 There are five stages of the experience we feel during our

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.760
 like some other meditation or meditation.
