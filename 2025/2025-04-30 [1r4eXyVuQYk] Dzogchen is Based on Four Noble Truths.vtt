Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche\nPSL One Month Dzogchen Retreat on Chetsun Nyingtik\nPadma Samye Ling Retreat Center\nApril 12 - May 10, 2025\n\nDay 6\nApril 25, 2025\n\nThe first Dzogchen masters left this world in a characteristic way: in a rainbow body of light after giving a final teaching to their disciples. In Tibet, the ones who spread the Nyingtik (heart essence) teaching of Clear Light were the great masters who possessed their special direct transmission, chiefly the great scholar Vimalamitra and Guru Padmasambhava. Vimalamitra passed these instructions to Chetsun Senge Wangchuk, who also attained the rainbow body. The teachings he left were later revealed by the First Khyentse, and are part of the secret category of Dzogchen pith instructions, Mengagde.\n\nThese rare and extraordinarily profound teachings precisely explain various essential methods for directly actualizing the innermost teachings of Ati Dzogpa Chenpo, the Great Perfection, the Peak Vehicle, which is the direct method for swiftly realizing the ultimate nature of the mind and attaining buddhahood in the rainbow light body.\n\nLearn more about this retreat:\nwww.padmasambhava.org/event-details-registration/restricted-silent-one-month-dzogchen-retreat-at-psl-w-ven-khenpo-tsewang-rinpoche-april-12-may-10-2025\n\nLearn more about the Chetsun Nyingtik:\nwww.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Chets%C3%BCn_Nyingtik\n\nwww.padmasambhava.org",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.030
 Now we go to the page four, in this book, the page four, or, no, the page, not four, page five,

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:26.640
 page five, we go here, here, page five, here, okay, and now we are in the, the piddate, piddate,

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.940
 yeah, piddate, train of the mind,

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:43.810
 or piddate, piddate of the, what's the name here, it's piddate. Piddate, yeah, train of the mind, p

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:51.940
iddate train of the mind, yeah, train of the mind, or is generally the teaching,

00:00:51.940 --> 00:01:00.540
 obtained in a hundred practice, known as the Renowned Sessions. So it's a Renowned Session. It's,

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:08.460
 as I said, generally this is also essence, based upon the essence of the teachings of the Four

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.940
 Noble Truths.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.450
 Not just only this is the best on the Four Noble Truths, Four Noble Truth is the first teaching of

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:21.260
 our gracious teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni Give, in Varanasi, or the now modern term called Sarnath,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.940
 the Dear Bhakti, give that.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:29.010
 But that teaching, that Four Noble Truth, the teaching is the foundation of all the teachings of

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.940
 Buddha Give.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:36.090
 So Dukti teaching is also based on the Four Noble Truth. Four Noble Truth is not just a kind of

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.940
 like, like, or just is like lower teachings, all that.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:48.540
 Because this Four Noble Truth is what? It's teachings on the cause and the result, or cause and

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.940
 effect, cause and effect.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:02:01.830
 Samsara has cause and the samsara has effect, or it is a result called samsara, samsara, effect.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.940
 And Narana has cause and it has effect on that.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:11.840
 So Narana is completely based upon the cause and effect or system of, and the samsara is completely

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.940
 based on the cause and effect.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:22.650
 Where cause and effect are? Working together is like magic display. That magic display is in

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:31.340
 Buddhism or in Buddha teaching, named interdependent coordination, or interdependent, interconnect

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.940
ions.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:39.240
 Working, where interconnections are working, if you think or observe that, how it's observing,

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.940
 there's nothing we can pinpoint. It's all magic display.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:55.720
 Where, for example, when we plant the seed, its explorer comes and all the result comes. But how

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:03.940
 that happening? In the Buddha teaching, all those great big fellows of us said you cannot pinpoint

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.940
 how shifting from the seed to the sprout.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:17.540
 Of course, we see the growth level, see, but subtle things, how shifting things. And that is also

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:26.200
 not just happy only because of the seed and then the soil and fertilizers or whatever those four

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.940
 elements, or five elements actually.

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:40.830
 Not just happening. There's so many factors. We don't intersect. All supported to happen that. Each

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.940
 of that has also so many articles.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:52.500
 So therefore, what great teacher Buddha Shakyamuni said, "Where things happening, the inter

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.940
connection is like magic display."

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:03.540
 What great master Nagarjuna said, "When, because of why it's happening, is because of emptiness.

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:13.940
 There's no substantial solid existing, solid, concrete, solid existing. Therefore, it's changing."

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:23.000
 When it's changing, there is space. If there is no space, never going to change. But we don't

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:31.200
 detect the space by our eyes. There is space. All that is, where it's coming, is the magical

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.940
 display.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:41.830
 This is what the external things, all that. So all that, everything, samsara, is called in the

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:50.250
 condition and it is resolved, happening as magically through the connection, interconnection or

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.940
 interdependence.

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:59.630
 And then nirvana realization and the display and all that nirvana displays in the sambhagaya

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:04.940
 display, pure land is also cause and condition and effect.

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:15.310
 That also happens as magical display. There's no substantially solid entity at all, both in samsara

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:16.940
 and nirvana.

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:26.010
 So that is the foundation of the great teacher Buddha gave, gave, gave the teaching. This teaching,

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:34.200
 poor Noble Truth, the teaching is known as the extraordinary teachings of the great teachers, not

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.940
 other great masters or the other schools, different schools.

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:46.800
 They're not explaining, explaining where things are happening, how that is, the magical display,

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:47.940
 all that.

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:55.930
 And so therefore, this realization, this, for example, in this case, this seven train of the mind,

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:05.200
 the force of five is mainly focused on the teachings, on the post-Nova Truth, among the poor Noble

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:05.940
 Truth.

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.940
 Suffering Truth, cause of Suffering Truth.

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:20.940
 This last three, three is mainly explaining of the third and fourth Noble Truth.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:38.420
 That's what that is. Cessation Truth and Path Truth. This, this picked the train of the mind, the

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:39.520
 liberation were never reversed. Back to the samsara or the, like, it is smallpox, it cools from the

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.940
 smallpox, is Cessation Truth.

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:57.650
 Cessation means what? In Sanskrit world, that is nirvana. What is it? Karma and emotions are ceased

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:01.940
. Cessation, that is.

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:11.150
 And then, here translated, liberate, liberation. Also sometimes, in Sanskrit, this cessation is

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:16.940
 known as mokcha. Mokcha, that means, again, liberated.

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:24.310
 Liberated from where? Liberated from the emotions, such as ignorance, attachment, anger, and

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:29.940
 jealous, hated thought, and ego-cling combination, were liberated.

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:39.940
 So that is Cessation. And then, now third, no, not third, but sixth and seventh is Path Truth.

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:50.930
 From this own world, all the way to the, under the, under all teaching, is Path Truth. Path Truth.

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:58.970
 How to get this Cessation Truth, how to get liberated, liberation, that which never returned back

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:07.910
 to the samsara or never coming back as a cure from the chorus, or smallpox, because of following

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:08.940
 Path Truth.

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:18.830
 Path Truth. That is whole teaching is really Path Truth. That, so therefore, for example, all the

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:24.940
 teachings of the nirvana teaching is Path Truth, is all Path Truth.

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:34.010
 And each explainer of the realization, the fulfillment, all that, is a Cessation Truth. We change.

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:41.940
 Even Dokti teachings is, of course, Dokti teaching is known as Result Yanas.

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:51.010
 Result Yana, not Causal Yanas. Result Yanas. But even though it is a Result Yana, to reach that

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:54.940
 Result Cessation, you have to practice. You have to meditate.

00:08:54.940 --> 00:09:02.940
 So practicing, following the teaching, and stalking from the lineage, following that is Path Truth.

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:12.000
 Then that will bring the realization of the Cessation Truth, or the enlightenment, or rainbow

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:12.940
 bodies.

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:19.600
 So that is generally the idea of this. Then yesterday I mentioned that this, this result of the

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.940
 liberation, I said there are three liberations.

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:32.780
 That is Shravaka Yana, and the essay is the Path of Bodhayana, and the Bodhisattva Yanas. Those are

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:33.940
 three liberations.

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:43.440
 But among that three liberations, which is forever. Which liberation is forever? Ever is Buddhahood

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:49.940
. Buddhahood is forever. There is no change at all.

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:56.870
 And for this Shravaka liberation, and the Path of Bodha liberation, even you are not returning back

00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:03.940
 to the samsara, but still, according to Mahayana, you have to follow more practices.

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:12.540
 Because you are not completely purified all the obscurations. And what that means is all the obsc

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:12.940
urations.

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:19.210
 I'm sure you know, many of you already know, I know, know that. There is two obscurations in the

00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:20.940
 teaching mentioned.

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:25.940
 Two obscurations. Emotion obscurations, and knowledge obscurations.

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:33.940
 This is Shravaka Yana, and the Path of Bodhayana, purify the emotion obscurations.

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:40.200
 Knowledge obscurations is not completely purified. Knowledge obscurations is not completely

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:40.940
 purified.

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:48.940
 Therefore, what the achievement or realization of Arhatahood is not something that forever.

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:57.540
 Again, or discover the enlightenment, true nature, exactly as it is, you have to follow the Path of

00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:58.940
 the Mahayana.

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:03.940
 Mahayana, and then will reach the enlightenment, exactly as a Buddha.

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:13.090
 Therefore, there are supposed true liberation, even though liberated from the samsara and negative

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:13.940
 emotions,

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:19.940
 but there is still knowledge obscurations. What is knowledge obscurations?

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:29.000
 That is generally, knowledge obscurations is. Knowledge obscurations is the foundation of old obsc

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:29.940
urations.

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:40.940
 Knowledge obscurations ever use the word clinging. Clinging is knowledge obscurations. Clinging.

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:48.940
 So for example, Shravaka Yana and the Path of Bodhayana, they have still clinging to the nirvana.

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:56.550
 At least they're clinging to the nirvana. They like to be certain attitude, I like to be free from

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:57.940
 the suffering,

00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:04.200
 free from the samsara. I'm not going to associate with the samsara. I'm not going to associate with

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:04.940
 the world.

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:10.940
 Because now I'm going to be peaceful myself, or be peaceful.

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:19.940
 That attitude, which is, they fulfill the goal, but still attachment, still grasping, clinging.

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:27.940
 So that is, what is knowledge obscuration is clinging, grasping.

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:31.940
 And the great master, Mohanur Mooji, all the great master mentioned,

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:39.940
 what is the distinction between the emotion obscurations and knowledge obscurations?

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:47.940
 Emotion obscurations is just a particular selected obscurations, particular.

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:51.940
 And the knowledge is general, all.

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:57.940
 They use the example, emotion obscuration is, for example, if you say general, what does that mean?

00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:03.940
 General. What is the name of the tree? For example, tree.

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:09.940
 Tree is the name of every tree. It's not just one tree.

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:22.930
 And then what is possible? Juniper. Juniper is one tree, selected tree, among all the hundreds or

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:24.940
 thousand trees.

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:34.780
 So it's a juniper. And similarly, emotion obscuration is like selected, particular, as like unipers

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:34.940
.

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:43.940
 Juniper trees, among all the emotions. And knowledge obscurations, all obscurations widen.

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:54.940
 And what that is, a pinpoint to that. And as I said, see, it's clinging, attachment, the clinging.

00:13:54.940 --> 00:14:01.940
 Clinging is the fundamental source of all the emotions. Emotions.

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:07.940
 Yeah. So that's because it's kind of a rough idea. A rough idea is that. So that's it.

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:13.940
 And now, also, that is really about that. So therefore, when we practice the meditation,

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:16.940
 and with the confidence, with the joy,
