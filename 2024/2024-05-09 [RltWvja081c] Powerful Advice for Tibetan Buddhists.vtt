00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.540
 Thank you very much, everyone. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.640
 Again, we stand on our vision and motivation.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:16.080
 Again, this is the teaching of our gracious friend, Tibetan teacher, Buddha Chaturmani.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:23.240
 He gives so many different levels of teachings according to our individual readiness

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.840
 so that they can follow, not the Buddha enforcing something and say,

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.920
 "This is what all of us have to do."

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:36.280
 Buddha, you lay out so many different techniques and skills and the nature of all those skills

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.200
 and teachings are best completed on the completion of love and kindness,

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.960
 joy and appreciation and respect for all living beings.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.840
 And to these trees, the glory is the nature of them, the glory is the nature of them.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.640
 Everyone here has it. So that is what our very gracious teacher is.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.320
 Again, to be retouching to that teaching.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.640
 This teaching is, of course, the Buddha gives the teaching, but reality is our nature.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:09.400
 Buddha just pointed out how much quality, richness and importance are really behind us,

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.480
 even though we go through some, start so many different challenges up in the dawn's home,

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.480
 but reality in nature never changes.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:24.560
 Nature is again, and nature is just really us to make that glorifying statement.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.840
 That's what the really teaching is, teaching all about that.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.880
 So with, again, kind of the completion of the gracious teacher of Buddha Shakyamuni

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.120
 and all the great masters, all those masters are practicing it.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.120
 The great practitioners, and then such as Gurbel Masambhav, who is also a second Buddha.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.280
 Buddha Shakyamuni himself predicted Gurbel Masambhav,

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.280
 upcoming Gurbel Masambhav, and Gurbel Masambhav is up all the teaching.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.160
 If Gurbel Masambhav did not say, "Oh, I'm the Buddha too. I'm going to give something different."

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:02.920
 Gurbel Masambhav emphasized, exactly teaching what Buddha gave.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.160
 That's how he lay out, along with the great master Shakyamuni.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.320
 That's why I lay out in the debate.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.640
 When he established Buddhism in the debate, that's what he taught.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.480
 Every single aspect.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.120
 There is teaching of Gurbel Masambhav by Gama.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.200
 Gama teaching of Gurbel Masambhav.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.200
 Then my teaching of Gurbel Masambhav.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.280
 Every teaching is lined up, exactly what the greatest teacher of Buddha, Giva.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.960
 He always emphasized that, emphasized to uphold that teaching.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.600
 Gurbel Masambhav himself was as great practitioners.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.720
 He practiced and meditated in different caves, in different cemeteries,

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.160
 in different places, all, all, and actualized realization.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.000
 Even he is already in light of status.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.400
 And then Shandara to the tree. That's why that way the Buddhism is one of the richest Buddhists,

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.880
 the richest of the Buddha teaching that really astounded you, perfectly,

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.520
 among all the Buddhist countries.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.880
 That's why great, great, his oneness,

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.720
 what in Dali I'm explaining always, all this,

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.080
 because of the beauty and kindness of these three great beings,

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.200
 great master Gurbel Masambhav, great master Shandara Kheda,

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:19.480
 great Dharma painter, the unshakeable courage and commitment, determination,

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.520
 loyal and devoted Dharma, that he really liked to establish this teaching

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.400
 that which will benefit the teacher of it and all,

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:34.320
 because he's always concerned in the virtue of his subject, particularly in the course of beyond.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:41.400
 So it's the best something that I can make legacy and vision and benefit happiness to the teacher

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.720
 that can ever learn his teaching.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.280
 That's what he made such a big effort, big core, courage and commitment.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.240
 At the beginning, some days, so many turbulence in that tree,

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:56.400
 even though he is most powerful in that time in the Tibetan or in the Central Asia,

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.760
 but yet he has struggled with so many reasons.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:05.760
 But through all this, his courage and commitment with assistance and blessings of the Gurbel Masamb

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:06.040
hav

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.280
 and Shandara Kheda established a powerful, powerful, beautiful Buddha teaching.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.640
 From the foundation teaching, which could be called some kind of Hinayana,

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.880
 all the way Doki teaching, really, completely.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.320
 The whole body of the teaching is completed.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.920
 They both treat the way.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.840
 Not just the both, the teaching translated only that,

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.680
 but also his block of editing and organized so they can practice it.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.040
 They work in practice. As in Gurbel Masambhav and Shandara Kheda,

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.880
 teaching and transmission and empowerment, they practice the meditation.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.640
 At that time, the short period of that, like in the 50 years short period,

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.400
 there's so many great enlightenment being said, period, one after another.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:58.120
 Those are, we all heard 25 disciples and disciples from Gurbel Masambhav and Shandara Kheda,

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:04.280
 and Bamanmata, as well as 70 or 80 Geba and Masvadath of Geba region.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.800
 That all happened in that period, in less than 100 years.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:14.160
 All that, really, the golden era of the realization and the scripture of the Buddha teaching,

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:20.240
 it shines throughout the valley and the mountain and the land of the Tibet.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:25.560
 It just becomes a really beautiful, powerful, powerful and peaceful country.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:31.120
 And just through that, and then everyone is inspired through generation to generation.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:36.040
 Until now, I mean, that's really the, really, it's become one of the beautiful,

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.400
 the upholders of Buddhism teachings that really are one of that great.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.920
 And so, again, we are talking to that teaching.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:46.360
 And particularly this time, we are really going to the Dokhi teaching,

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.120
 which is the pinnacle teaching of the great teacher, Buddha Shatyamuni.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.640
 Oh, whether Samanabhadara or Garab Dorji or Barapayam or Samanam,

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.720
 Bamanmata, their heart drop teaching.

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.280
 Teaching, so we are really connected to that.

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.680
 And then that's what we all know.

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:07.600
 I'm again saying these things because we have respect and joy and appreciation

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.680
 and thankful, grateful.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.440
 For as I said the other day, I mean, you know, we have so many reasons

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.120
 to feel happy and joy and being grateful.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.520
 We are blessed ones, really, we are blessed ones.

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.680
 And feel that really is true, true.

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:26.160
 We are blessed ones in many ways, dharma level and as well as worldly levels,

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.320
 all compared.

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.160
 I mean, look to that around the world.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.200
 If it is a truly fast changing, how many people are going

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.200
 through a different suffering, difficulty challenges?

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.840
 All that, we heard this.

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.160
 We heard that.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.760
 We see some drops on the technology level, all that.

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.600
 But here, we are just really enjoying us.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.480
 We don't have any authority.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:50.840
 We just enjoy the curious and comfortable and very beautiful life's life.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.080
 And that is samsara level.

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.200
 But in Buddhism, that's what we call the 18 endowment.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.560
 We have 18 college of that.

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.200
 That's so special.

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.680
 Really so special.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.480
 So even though we all agree, we have something very different.

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:08.920
 Our mind is more connected with the love and kindness of people,

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:10.640
 all living beings.

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.600
 And then we are going to devote to dharma.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.480
 And then we devote to dharma.

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.520
 And we have the worries of dharma.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.200
 All the different levels of the teaching is available.

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.520
 And we can read and inspire ourselves.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.800
 All this is really so special and beautiful.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:31.040
 This is not also happened by accidentally or just happened

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.800
 according to the Christian teacher of Buddha's teaching.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.120
 It is our something connection.

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:38.000
 Fast, calm, real meaning.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.800
 Reconnect with that.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.320
 Now, it is our responsibility to glorify that.

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:44.320
 We strengthen that.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:49.200
 So we make even better and more bright and more peaceful,

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:53.160
 more rewarding to our lives of the come

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.880
 and also beyond this our lives, continually.

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.320
 That is our responsibility.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:01.280
 So yet, they have to bring joy and appreciation

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:05.040
 and the kindness of complete thought, which is both each other.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.560
 Thinking more, living beings.

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.720
 One, that our practice, meditation, studying,

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:12.360
 contemplating, and meditation practice,

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:15.600
 whatever, even one minute, two seconds,

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:18.360
 we do really wish that we benefited

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:21.840
 to all being really best upon the completion of the body,

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:24.280
 that those are the techniques that are so important.

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:25.440
 And we can remember.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.840
 Of course, we have so many consumption thought

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.600
 that kind of even we have those beautiful things,

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.920
 but we kind of ignored it and kind of went through

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:36.600
 in the midst of so many other consumption.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:37.760
 It just went away.

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.240
 But to highlight those beautiful thought

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.200
 and just really dedicate the merit

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:45.880
 for all the beings and to wish good things to everyone.

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:47.920
 That is bodhicata practice.

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:50.440
 Very simple, bodhicata, good heart.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.520
 And we learned that also teaching,

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.560
 wishing bodhicata is just from the heart.

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:57.880
 Wishing bodhicata and bodhicata too.

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.880
 Wishing bodhicata and actualizing bodhicata.

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.840
 Wishing bodhicata is from the heart.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:04.800
 Good things, wishing good things

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.720
 for all the beings from the heart.

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:07.760
 Sensitive.

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:10.240
 Sensitive for two seconds a minute.

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:13.880
 And that is [inaudible] and through those.

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:16.120
 And then dedicate the merit of those.

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:17.440
 And we can remember that.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.840
 That is what teaching makes it all the way.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.840
 And with those we were told, and then we go to that again.

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.880
 And this is the key teaching.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.640
 We see everything is in three kayak state.

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:30.640
 Three kayak state is the outer object

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.160
 of the three kayak state.

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.720
 In our mind is in three kayak state.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:38.480
 Everything and all, everything is in three kayak state.

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:42.480
 It's like Dharmakaya, Sambukaya, and Dharmakaya state.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:46.080
 And they are also not three different individuals.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.680
 All different generations.

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:50.040
 According to teaching, all is in all.

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.720
 All the same Dharmakaya.

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:54.840
 Within the Dharmakaya, it has all three kayak.

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.680
 Within the Sambukaya, it has all three kayak.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:01.280
 Within the Dharmakaya, it has all three kayaks.

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:02.760
 It's not something separated.

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:05.160
 All the different generations like that.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.440
 And then what is Dharmakaya?

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.920
 Dharmakaya is that the ekol is lokitiji.

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:13.440
 We learn learning is like emptiness aspect

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:16.200
 of the nature of the mind is Dharmakaya.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:19.200
 And then the clarity, the energy aspect

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.360
 of the nature of the mind is Sambukaya.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:27.360
 And display of the movement of the mind is the Dharmakaya.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:31.120
 And the movement of the Dharmakaya is also known

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:34.960
 as union of the emptiness and the clarity.

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:36.800
 That's the union.

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:41.080
 This Dharmakaya is a union of the emptiness and clarity.

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:44.120
 So that means the Dharmakaya is a union

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:47.080
 of the Dharmakaya and Sambukaya.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:50.440
 They are all called Dharmakaya and Sambukaya.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:54.000
 That is a pervasive continuity.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.640
 That is more, Dharmakaya is more engaged,

00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:00.920
 more healthy, more ushering to the others,

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:02.320
 to benefit others.

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.800
 That's called Dharmakaya South World.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:09.560
 An initiative translated roughly is emanation of poems.

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:14.560
 Emination, nirma is emanation, kaya is a poem.

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:20.320
 F-O-R-A-M poems, emanation of poems, poems.

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:23.320
 That is nirma kaya.

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.600
 That's the union of the clarity

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:30.600
 and clarity of Sambukaya and Dharmakaya, union of them.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:34.400
 So again, see everything in that state.

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:37.040
 The other day we went, and you all know that.

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:39.640
 That we went in the course of Shabazzo.

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:41.000
 Followed out the teaching.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.480
 There is the old basic three kayas

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:49.080
 and then the reflection of the three kayas.

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:52.360
 And basic three kaya is our own nature of the mind.

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:53.200
 It's the best.
