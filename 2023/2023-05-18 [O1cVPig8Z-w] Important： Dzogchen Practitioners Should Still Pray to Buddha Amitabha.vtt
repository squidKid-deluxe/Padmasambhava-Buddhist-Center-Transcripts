00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360
 Really, as much as we can, we're really doing that. But along with that, you already know

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:11.040
 that, in the teachings said, Buddha's teachings said, and all those great Vedayana Mahathma's

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.900
 open said, and Buddha repeated throughout his Sutra teachings, "Do pray to Amitabha."

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:24.400
 Really he said that. He's always in the teaching, Buddha said that. And just one after another

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:31.680
 in the Sutra teachings. And then also, Parigula in Amitabha Sutra said that, "To take the

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:39.680
 rebirth in the Pure Land of Dewache is so easy than others." And some ask, you say, this

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.840
 in the Sutra teachings, there is not, it takes to reach enlightenment, three countless eons.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.480
 It's long term, even the high capabilities, three countless eons. But practice of Amitabha

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:59.840
 is a shortcut to reach enlightenment. Because you practice of this, practice of Amitabha,

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:08.240
 you will go to the devotee of even the Amitabha, and there you can practice without any obstacles.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:15.170
 And your motivation is obstacle with distractions. Your motivation in that teachings, in the devote

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.280
e,

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:21.920
 you're so motivated, not just the motivation of the practice of one, today and not tomorrow,

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:28.560
 day after tomorrow. It's always increasing. That really says so. And so therefore, ten

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.720
 bhoomis or five part ten bhoomis that go quite pretty smooth. Although smooth, not just that,

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.240
 during that time, we won't have troubles, difficult obstacles. It's everything moves

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.640
 so beautifully, really in the teachings. So in the Buddha's teaching, the Amitabha Sutra

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:51.600
 you say what? Poor cause to take the rebirth in devotee, poor cause. That is poor cause.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:59.120
 Poor is remembering, thinking of the Buddha Amitabha. And very retent such as our lokpide shura

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:05.760
 and the Vaidya pani, thinking that. And then all the fuel and conduct as you see. And facing in

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:12.160
 the west direction, thinking of that. It's Buddha Amitabha and the Jainese and the Vaidya pani are

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:19.280
 leaving Buddha right now. Really not now. It's not. And so thinking of that, clearly with good

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:26.880
 heart or devotees. Then second cause is doing the lateral meditory activities. Whatever we do,

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:35.440
 meditory as the practice, the meditating, whatever we do, we do. True lateral meditory activities,

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.240
 that's what we're doing. I mean, that is not something. If you can do extra, great. But

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:50.240
 whatever you can do. And the third cause is bodhichala, bodhichala. More love and

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:57.920
 compare, thinking of all sentient beings. And the fourth is bringing may I and all

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:05.520
 beings to take the rebirth and devotee in this, when we leave this. So those are the simple cause.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:13.520
 Even if Buddha Haikeman said to Ananda, looking first, look to the, toward the direction of the

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:21.120
 Amitabha and pick up the flowers from the growing on the, on the narrow side. Throw that as

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.600
 offering.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:27.840
 That single flower is not just one flower in the teaching. I mean, in the other teaching says,

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:38.000
 it multiplies, multiplies flower. It's not just one. We meditated that. It becomes the whole

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:47.040
 insert of five object offerings. Object, home, song, smell, taste, and touch,

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:55.030
 multiplied and make that offering. Thinking of to be chegri, birth, to devotee, to all living

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.760
 beings.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:04.480
 Really, that these four causes, remembering Buddha's image or our locus or anything,

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:11.840
 were japani. And whatever the marital activities we do, and thinking to cause for the in life,

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:18.160
 to take the rebirth, they were king. And then we devote each other and pray the aspirations.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:24.960
 Again, that is in the teaching says, really so powerful is a symbol. But that really means

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.160
 don't do the documentation practice. The documentation practice is so powerful.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.840
 Those are the so powerful. But along with that, just to do that for all living beings,

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:42.960
 is really so good. I just thought to you and tell you and to remind you to all of us. So we,

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.840
 that, okay, thank you and everyone. And then now, and now we,
