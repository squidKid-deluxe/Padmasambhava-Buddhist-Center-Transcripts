00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.560
 We are ready to receive and we open our heart. That's what the devotion is. Without doubt and

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:15.920
 hesitations, bring that sunlight of the blessings. Let that enter into our heart and mind as open

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.520
 the mind with full of devotees. Let it grow, bloom our realization and the beautiful Buddha

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:27.680
 nature or the Buddha nature of the youthful West body. Let that is. And that is devotion.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.720
 As in, as is the joy and appreciation, and then devotion is so important to activate the

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:35.760
 realization

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:43.040
 to bloom, to mature the realization. Devotion is the necessary. With all the devotion,

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:50.080
 it becomes intellectual. It is skeptical. When you have the devotion, a deep devotion

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:56.400
 that settles in the heart and ready to grow, ready to bloom. And all our practice will come

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.920
 perfectly into the path as we really want. So that as the one it is, you know, the supposed line,

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.200
 and of course it's seven line praise. And then all the lineage praise, and then there's the good

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.840
 practice praise of the His Holiness, which is the revealer of this particular teaching. And as well

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.200
 as not just only this, we're all connected to these great masters. As I think I said this,

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.800
 His Holiness, we become the one of the great masters and true descentions, true descentions.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:32.480
 He becomes master of the masters. He becomes the teacher of the teachers, teachers. I think almost

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:39.020
 every Nima practitioner, every Nima great teachers, and all become His students who are out of

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.520
 Tibet,

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:46.000
 in the 1950s, who came out of, I think it becomes almost everyone really. And then in Tibet too,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.600
 not just only Nima practitioner, so many guiding practitioners, guiding great masters also become

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.600
 student of His Holiness. He is not just become kind of because by chance that He become great

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.160
 master,

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.760
 but He is truly one of the great enlightened beings in that time. That time in the 20th century,

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:10.800
 still His blessings is continued, very warm and fresh, and continuing that. And then also we are

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.880
 all connected to these teachings. We are the disciples of so many great Nima masters,

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.720
 and they, everyone is connected to this, so to His Holiness that we pray. And then next one

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:29.200
 is Kijibati Hiromu. We are all connected to this area, great master, many of us connect to this

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.940
 many masters, and he was one of the very important lineage holder of also doing His Holiness

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:35.840
 teachings.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:42.320
 So that is what is here which is. And then next one, this bed hall, is a general kind of praise

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.600
 to all the practice lineage. It's very popular prayer to the three root. It is also practiced

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:56.320
 by all Nima schools, and as well as other schools. This too, and it's very popular. So this is what

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.560
 is

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.320
 all, and so I just add it all. So that is the general kind of preparation of the practices.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:09.120
 Every practice meditation we do, we should start with these practices. And then next one is a

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:16.240
 slightly different, particularly for these practices. That I will go again from page 5,

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:26.000
 page 5, all the way to the page, page 7, at the middle of the page 7. Here it also

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:37.200
 means section, the meditation and the recitation. Before that, so that means from page 5,

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:43.990
 all the way to the middle of the page 7, is that particularly preparation of the foundation

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.640
 practice

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.640
 of these, these political practices. Fascinating practices, foundation practices.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:57.680
 Then, middle of the page 7, it is started from my own mind, uncontracted display of the emptiness,

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:11.440
 from that, that way, and all the way to, to bed, bed, bed 10, bed 10, and middle of the bed 10 here

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.080
,

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:20.000
 or not middle of the bed 10, even that one last line above this bed, bed 10 bed. And here in the

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:27.120
 footnote said that thus our three doors are sealed by the radial body, speak mind, and then of the

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:33.520
 dakinis. After that is the principle part of the practices. Principle part of the practice,

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:39.920
 second main part of the practices. And then the last part of this practice is starting with the

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:51.440
 last line of this bed 10, then to enter this bed 12. So this is the last and concluding part of

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:58.160
 the practices. This is generally very important. Every practice has great master Lujima said,

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.360
 and can keep what they hear and what they repeat many times, again and again. And as well as other

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:09.680
 great monsters too. I mean this, if we practice a complete one whole practices, it should have

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:18.470
 all these three. How to begin, how to practices, how to conclude. Is that is all about. For example

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:18.480
,

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:24.000
 if our body, if we kind of use the example of body, we should have the head of the body,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.200
 body of the body, or principle part of the body, we should have the limbs or feet of the bodies.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:35.920
 And this first preparation part of practice is like head of the practices. Practice. And the

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:42.240
 principle part of practice is the main principle body of the practices. And then concluding

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.720
 practice

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:51.680
 is the limbs or feet. So that we should complete it that way. Head, body, and the limbs of the body

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.680
.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:58.480
 Every somehow is missing that is not completed. One of them missing is not completed. Therefore,

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:05.760
 it is very important. For that reason, great master Lujima said, the past novel, second novel,

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:13.120
 third novel. If you have three novels, this will bring the realization, great master Lujima said.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:20.560
 Those who are really practicing, these three premise should take as dearly to your, as frame

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:26.640
 of your practice. That's the great master Lujima said. So therefore, his three premise is that,

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:33.430
 that within that context. So it's very important. And now we go to the, the kurukule practice

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:33.920
 itself.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:41.760
 So the principle part of this bad five. Five. And again, as divided, you know, the first,

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:48.640
 middle, and kungkuluni. So now we go to the, to the, the first part of these practices. To do these

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:56.480
 practices, this first practice has one, rafu and bodhicaka. And accumulate numerical. Those

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:03.840
 are the first part of the practices, foundation practices. And to do this, we're going to

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:12.880
 visualize, visualize entire nimendala of the kurukule. Right in front of sky. Sky, and to,

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:18.480
 to do this praise, and then this is here. That to kind of, to remind that, to activate that

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:19.520
 meditation

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:26.800
 in, in the page five, what he said. In front of us, in the sky, we were the guru, inseparably

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:33.830
 from the wisdom dakinis. Guru of yechim soja, or kurukule, or gurupayama samad, which is insepar

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:34.320
able.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:43.040
 Separably, gurukule, yechim soja, and tara, that we see inseparable. And that we will see in,

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:50.080
 that right in front of sky, as an accidental wisdom, rainbow body. Body of love and compassion

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:56.480
 must be lost. So that is what we say. And of the rafu, we shall visualize clearly, and as

00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:01.760
 a midst of a rainbow light, emanate out of a rainbow light of love, compassion, wisdom.

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:06.480
 Bless me to ask to all the certain beings, in front of them, that we shall feel great,

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:13.520
 joy never changes. And a very strong devotions, and a strong, sensitive breath. As much as we can

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:20.320
 breathe up joy, as much as we can breathe, breathe up the devotion, devotion, and longing, and this

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:27.360
 yearning, that attitude, that much, we're really deep in our practices, our meditation. It's not

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:34.480
 just a kind of like, on the surface, levels. Truly we become practicing. It really begins to

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:42.160
 sit, our in life goal, and cleansing purify our old, happy parents, that which is not

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:49.600
 important to us, not healthy for us, with cleansing purifies, purify. So that is what really we can

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:55.920
 measure, how much our practice is growing, and deepening that. Emotion, joy, and appreciations.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:04.240
 This, with this thought, and then we check refuge. Raphody, and here, bodhicata struggle. First two

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:04.640
 lines

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:14.400
 are refuge. Second two lines are bodhicata. This is practice bodhicata. Raphody and bodhicata,

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:21.280
 you see, is not a regular way to practice. In general, we're practicing raphody and bodhicata.

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:28.880
 It is more absolute level, or the jotting level, tracking raphon, and develop the bodhicata.

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:35.920
 That is what it is. First two lines are explaining of the raphon, the absolute level, and the jot

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:36.160
ting

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:42.720
 level. Second two lines are explaining how to develop our bodhicata according to the jotting

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:49.600
 levels, or the absolute levels. The first is important to know. Of course, you already know

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:56.560
 that, but however, what is general refuge? When we take refuge, the other way to take refuge.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:03.040
 The general way to take refuge is, again, is that nature is the same. Devotion, but with devotion

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:09.040
 and joy, what are we going to add? Confidence. We're going to confidence for the trustees,

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:14.400
 and the closeness feeling to the Buddha dharma sangha, and see Buddha dharma sangha as a

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:22.640
 totally enlightened beings. Truly, they are our role models. Our role models journey to the

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:29.920
 enlightenment. Buddha is a great teacher who teaches us a tiny part to the way to enlightenment,

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:35.520
 exactly teaches how to cleanse and purify. Not just Buddha becomes the teacher and speaks of

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:42.640
 lecturers, but Buddha practice that. Buddha practice, Buddha meditated, and he actualized

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:49.040
 what he's talking. He actualized. So he's not just a talker, but he is, realized the great

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:55.120
 enlightenings, full of love and compassion and wisdom, and free from the ego and self-importance

00:10:55.120 --> 00:11:01.760
 and the greediness, negative emojis. That whole song, "Enlight the Gollates," is right in front of

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:09.200
 us, filled closeness with confidence, joy. How wonderful that I had said great opportunity to

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:16.880
 connect to such this great being, that I'm going to reveal my nature as well as it did. Feel really

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:22.480
 strong presence there. This that with that great confidence and also some understanding of the

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:28.480
 samsara situation. Samsara, there's so many challenges, one after another. Pastable is

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:36.240
 informative. And second, there's so many going on in one after another. Another, 200 like to change

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:42.640
 that situation with samsara, there's nothing any other alternatives except to reveal our beautiful

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:49.920
 nature, our courage and commitment, understanding openness. That is what will change. The whole

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:56.480
 things, not just only it will change to us, but it will really benefit with other beings. Therefore

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:56.480
,

00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:02.080
 with this understanding, I'm going to take refuge and make close connection with the confidence and

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:07.520
 joy and the trust with the appreciation to the Buddha Dhamma sama. And then Dhamma is, you know,

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:12.720
 Dhamma is the teaching. There's a variety of the teachings the Buddha showed. No matter whatever

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:19.280
 the teaching is, nature of teaching is non-violence. Nature is teaching, is appreciating,

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:20.320
 respectful,

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:26.640
 harmonic, peace to every living beings, not just a selective guru, these and that things. The love

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:32.080
 and the compassion is a pervasive nature, the teaching said, to every living. Because every

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:39.520
 living being inherited in the Buddha nature, every living has to be ready to get enlightenment.

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:45.600
 Everyone has the same goal and the right to get enlightenment. They have freedom to get

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:46.480
 enlightenment.

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:51.270
 We have to create and we have to make opportunities, circumstances, so the God can get

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:52.160
 enlightenment.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:58.560
 That's the nature of the teaching. Sometimes the spirituals follow that path with courage and

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:05.040
 commitment, with determination, with devotion, with love and union as we explain. No matter what

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:10.880
 realization they are, the connection is the same, goal is the same, same, practice is best.

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:18.720
 Same. So being close to all this. This is known as generally taking refuge. Generally taking

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:24.400
 refuge to the... taking refuge in the Buddha dharmasana. In the absolute level,

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:31.680
 tracking refuge, and then it says that. All these three Buddha, three jewels, Buddha dharmasana,

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:38.720
 where it merges in the absolute level, is no other than one's own awareness, the self-awareness,

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:48.240
 your raka, my raka. Raka is embodiment of three jewels. Raka is embodiment of Buddha.

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:53.840
 Raka is embodiment of the dharmas. Raka is embodiment of the dharmas. What means the

00:13:53.840 --> 00:14:00.000
 Buddha actually? What means the Buddha? Buddha means fully weightless. Raka is fully weightless.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:06.240
 And what meaning of the teaching? Dharmas. Dharmas means the one who is maintained on the path.

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:13.200
 Raka will keep us to the path. No matter whatever situation, circumstance, we go through life after

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:20.640
 life. The nature never change. It will keep that continuing, that qualities. The nature of the

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:29.040
 raka is calm, peace, harmony, and openness. That is what essence of this. And what meaning of the

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:35.840
 Sangha? Sangha means virtually committed. That is actually the meaning of Sangha. Committed to the

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:49.040
 virtues. Virtues. Raka is that nature. Raka is great, committed to virtue beyond the activities

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:58.320
 as a subject or object. It is whole song of the virtues. So Raka is the embodiment of three jewels,

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:05.360
 Buddha, Dharma, Sangha. And that raka is what? The nature of the raka is the wisdom. The nature of

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:05.440
 the

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:11.520
 raka is ultimate compassion. The nature of the raka is the ultimate loving kindness. That tender

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:12.000
 love,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:19.120
 that tender compassion, that clear understanding is known as the khandro or the wisdom dakinis.

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:28.800
 The khandro is here. What means is the khandro. In the teaching grade, Maasam Gurupema Samba said,

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:33.920
 in Kainthi Padaheeru Munjana, many times, he typed the quotation there. He said, one who had the

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:41.840
 other side of the openness, everything, and the wisdom and the compassion, pretty moving to every

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:49.680
 direction. That is the what the khandro. Kha is the space. Rho means goer, sometimes translated in

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:49.760
 the

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:58.160
 Hindi. Sky goers or sky movers. Sky is this song, the great openness, vastness of the vastness of

00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:58.480
 the

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:06.160
 space of dana dapu. Who is going? Wisdom and compassion are pretty moving to every direction

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:14.400
 without any partialities, without any restrictions. That is the great wisdom dakim. Who carried

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:14.720
 that

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:23.280
 nature? Who carried that identity? Who has that? It's our raka. When you relax a raka in the

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:23.600
 natural

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:30.880
 state of mind, as it is, raka has no blockage. Raka has no limitations. Raka is not a khandro

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:38.320
 partialities. It brings in nature everywhere. And that is when you have that understanding.

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:45.680
 Clearly that understanding, raka never changed. As I said, no matter what challenge you throw,

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:53.200
 what will we go? Go. It's always with us. That's what the Buddha said. Whatever the situation

00:16:53.200 --> 00:17:03.920
 we go through, is always nature never changed. Nature never changed. It's not proved. It's not

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:14.400
 devaluated. Because it's out of those dominoes. Proving, not proving, devaluating, separating,

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:21.440
 not separating. This is the dogma. This is the consultant level. Raka is out of that boundaries.

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:27.920
 Therefore, it is always the same. And not what is nature, as I said too many times, you all know.

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:36.560
 It's nature, it's love. All must have love and compassion. What's that? That union, that combined

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:44.960
 quality, the pristine, all-song, that authenticness, that. That is the one that requires. And that

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:45.200
 is

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:53.760
 absolute Muslim Dakini. Seeing that, recognizing that, with a greater joy, with a greater devotion,

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:59.520
 relaxing that natural state is absolute tracking body. Oh, sorry, absolute tracking rakut.

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:06.000
 That's what the teaching said here. We take rakutya continually in our own awareness of

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:18.000
 the Muslim Dakini. We take rakutya continually in our awareness of the Muslim Dakini.

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:34.810
 Maybe it's one word missing here, maybe. But we take our own, what's called, we take rakutya

00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:35.440
 continually

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:46.480
 in our own awarenessness, the Muslim Dakini, without coming and parting. Coming and parting.

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:54.720
 Parting. Because in Tibet here, dum dar, dum dar, dar is coming. Dar means separations.

00:18:55.360 --> 00:19:04.960
 So free from a kind of simple oscillation, free from coming and going. And with that,

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:09.760
 which rakutya refers. So that is the meaning of these parts of rakutya. That's brilliant.

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:20.240
 Second is then the bodhicitta. As again, as I said, the third line and fourth line is bodhicitta.

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:26.560
 And how it said here, this absolute bodhicitta, the realized, unrealized, deluded mind clink to the

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:33.200
 duality. We develop the enlightened mind of the great self-liberations. That was translated here.

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:41.280
 That is the bodhicitta, bodhicitta, absolute bodhicitta. Now, general bodhicitta. The general

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:46.000
 bodhicitta, of course, you won't know. That means the essence of the Mahayana teaching,

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.440
 essence of the Vadiyana teaching, bodhicitta, bodhicitta is. With all the bodhicitta,

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:58.800
 there is no Mahayana teaching. There is no Vadiyana teaching. In fact, with all the bodhicitta,

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:04.080
 cheddar and love and completion, there is no bodhicitta teaching at all. Bodhicitta is totally

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:10.800
 best upon the completion and understanding. That is the best. No matter if there is Hinayana,

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:16.640
 whether it is Mahayana, whether it is Vadiyana is best on the completion and wisdom or

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:17.520
 understanding.

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:23.680
 That's what it is. And now, generally in the Mahayana teaching, what is the difference between

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:30.960
 Mahayana and Hinayana? Because Mahayana highlights of the bodhicitta. Mahayana highlights of the

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:37.040
 completion, love and kindness for all the sentient beings. Very much emphasize the highlights that

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:42.560
 become the principle, essential practices of the Mahayana. Therefore, it is Mahayana.

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:50.000
 Not named. Otherwise, Hinayana has completion. Hinayana has love and kindness. Hinayana has

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:59.440
 wisdom. They don't emphasize, highlight it as Mahayana and Vadiyana. So, therefore,

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:04.800
 generally in the Mahayana teaching, bodhicitta, of course, again, we all know, we all heard so many

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:11.760
 thoughts. It is the best upon the completion. Taking all sentient beings, I like to generate

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:19.040
 bodhicitta. And therefore, what is the quality or the identity of the bodhicitta is

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:27.840
 wisdom and compassion. Combined together is known as bodhicitta. And what the great master

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:36.080
 Maitriya or Khasanga said in his teachings, in the Pandyavaramata, Alankara teaching,

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:43.920
 he said, by compassion, thinking all the sentient beings, by wisdom,

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:51.440
 looking forward to get enlightenment. That's what he said. That is bodhicitta. So, that means what?

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:56.800
 Most of you generate a great compassion to all living beings. That means I like to remove the

00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:02.960
 sufferings of all the sentient beings and cause of the sufferings of all the sentient beings.

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:08.640
 That's what really I like to do that. Not just remove the suffering, but cause of the sufferings.

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:14.960
 That sufferings, when we go through the challenges in samsara, this is not just happening

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:21.760
 itself or quite accidentally. It has cause. It has conditions. The common conditions

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:28.160
 bore up that resolve of the challenges. So, that we like to play away,

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:35.920
 challenge itself and cause of a challenge in any difficulties. That is the word. And in order to

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:40.640
 this, in order to this, we don't have that capability right now to do that. Even if we

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:46.800
 have that really heartfelt yearning, courage and commitment, we don't have that capability

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:53.440
 except to pray, except to witness. And therefore, how to do this? This is getting enlightened.

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:59.200
 Become ourselves a Buddha, ourselves enlightened. So, therefore, by understanding through the

00:22:59.200 --> 00:22:59.920
 wisdom,

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:06.380
 you're really projecting your realization, become clearly understanding. We are out of the boundary

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:06.560
.

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:12.000
 We are out of all those ditches and troubles so that we can help all the sentient beings.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.920
 So, to do that is the enlightenment. We become Buddha. Together, we become bodhisattvas. So,

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:23.520
 therefore, by compression, projecting into the sentient beings, by the wisdom,

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:30.240
 projected to the enlightenment and the combination is bodhisattvas. That is what bodhisattva is.

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:35.960
 And now, bodhisattva itself, what there is like, and of course in the teaching, so just I remind

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:36.400
 this,

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:42.720
 this, and this is called two bodhisattvas. Wishing bodhisattva and actualizing bodhisattvas,

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:48.160
 two bodhisattvas. And wishing bodhisattva is, again, a great master of namjimasit. This

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:55.200
 wishing bodhisattva is all boundless. How we develop the wishing bodhisattva? Wishing bodhisattva,

00:23:55.200 --> 00:24:01.280
 of course, we wish sentient beings having joy and peace, but how we really activated that so

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:09.120
 beautiful, so strongly, so massive, without any boundary. That is called poor boundless, boundless

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:16.240
 love, boundless compassion, boundless joy, boundless equanimities. And with that, do our

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:21.120
 prayers. We have beautiful prayers that, again, voice of the great masters, ancient times,

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:27.360
 they did this. They prayed that prayers and they activated that. And as we do, may all living

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:27.600
 beings

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:34.640
 have the great happiness, the cause of happiness. That is boundless love. Pray that, reflect that

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:43.040
 meaning into the heart and the giant. Giant, truly, that. May all living beings, we are not making

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:43.280
 any

00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:49.680
 partialities. And then same way, may all living beings, free from suffering, cause of suffering,

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:58.000
 wish sincerely that giant and wish that. And then may everyone have the great joy, joy,

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:05.040
 free from all the difficult troubles, all the miserable, never separated from that joy. Again,

00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:10.720
 in third line, in Buddha's argument, we have that. Beautiful. And fourth is great equanimities.

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:19.680
 Each of those prayers is wholesome. The whole practices, each of those. Great

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:28.400
 equanimities. Many times, each of those is really just super practices. Each of them we think that.

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:35.600
 And that will cleanse and purify and remove all obstacles, negativities, so many beautiful stories.

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:42.080
 It's not just that. We have sincerely our love and compassion that fill that attitude in your heart

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:42.080
,

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:50.000
 or our heart. Immediately we feel so calm, so peace, so harmony. We cannot open ourself, we cannot

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:59.350
 restrict it. This is what is called poor, boundless practices. It's so spiritual. And to activate

00:25:59.350 --> 00:25:59.760
 that

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:05.360
 practice of body, wishing body, then tungni practices. All those tungni practices are known

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:14.000
 as activating, actualizing the wishing body together in actions, in actions. And with these

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:21.280
 beautiful teachings, then second bodhicitta, bodhicitta is then engaging bodhicitta by actualizing

00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:29.810
 bodhicitta. Those best of these poor, boundless, then you will carry the six paramatas. Six paramat

00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:30.000
as

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:37.280
 combined with the wishing bodhicitta. The first paramata of the generosity combined with poor,

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:44.960
 boundless. And second, morality is combined with poor, boundless. And the third paramata is patient

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:51.520
 and combined with poor, boundless. And so on, one after another. And joyful effort is continually

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:58.560
 helping. And with again poor, boundless paramatas. So never separated, together and activating body

00:26:58.560 --> 00:26:58.560
,

00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:05.440
 that actualizing bodhicitta through the six paramatas. That is known as general bodhicitta

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:10.720
 practices. Very important. With all of these bodhicitta, there is no enlightenment, there is

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:16.400
 no spiritual, and there is no really growth of our realization will come. And for that reason,

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:24.010
 the great master, the great master, he said, if you have one thing, it's enough that to get

00:27:24.010 --> 00:27:24.880
 enlightenment

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:32.560
 is bodhicitta. If you don't have one thing, no matter how much techniques and skills or

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:43.330
 basic practices, it really won't work. Work, as he said, is bodhicitta. And so there, this bodhic

00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:43.760
itta

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:52.400
 is the unmistakable, unmistakable, correct cause and condition to become the enlightenment

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:59.200
 or become our self-warrior from the samsara. And become the bravery from the samsara,

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:05.680
 and reach the victorious ones. And it defeated all the negative emotions through bodhicitta.

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:11.520
 It's bodhicitta. That. And again, you can keep out of here, I clearly remember, even kind of his

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:11.920
 songs,

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:20.000
 again and again saying, this is what the bodhicitta is. This is. And this is now so

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:27.600
 briefly about general bodhicittas. Then absolute bodhicitta is here, again. This. How you develop

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:33.120
 this bodhicitta? First line, they said, unlearn the deluded beings clinging to the dualities.

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:42.720
 They didn't realize the nature, anxiety of them. Nature of their own, our own nature of the whole,

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:48.080
 this object and so on. They didn't realize it, that this nature. Therefore, they're clinging.

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:56.080
 Clinging is not the realized activities. Clinging is unrealized activities. And therefore,

00:28:56.080 --> 00:29:03.680
 clinging is ignorance. Clinging is a dullness. And we think it's good to do. And then we are,

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:09.520
 karmala become complete opposite direction. And then when you're clinging, clinging that and

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:17.120
 create the whole mass of karmas, karma activities, all comes the emotions. Emotions, one after

00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:17.200
 another,

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:24.160
 such as negative emotions, are raging one after another because we're clinging. Thinking that

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:31.120
 will help us to bring some kind of support, some confidence. Then we do all these emotions.

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:40.720
 Thinking. But instead, we are kind of hurting ourselves. Because of that here, because of that,

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:47.440
 the great compassion. Arise the great drift of compassion without any subject or object in the

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:55.680
 zoki level or in absolute levels. The pervasive compassion. Compassion brings up that which is,

00:29:55.680 --> 00:30:03.040
 Rava is the embodiment of the compassion. Bring that. And Rava, even the competitive suffering

00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:09.120
 is generated in your heart and mind or our heart and mind. There's no substantial, solid existing

00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:17.920
 compassion itself. It's self-liberated. As compassion arises, that moment is liberated

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:24.080
 or that is the enlightened status. Compassion is the enlightened status. There's no solid existing

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:29.760
 compassion. Therefore, our compassion at the absolute level is the pervasive. There's no

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:35.680
 boundary. There are no limitations. Bring that realization clearly with the great compassion

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:43.120
 and understanding in the inconceivable, comparative status and be in that status.

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:49.600
 Be that, embracing that nature. That is known as the absolute bodhijabahid.

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:55.040
 That is really about rafu in bodhijabhas. And the next one is then,

00:30:56.720 --> 00:31:04.480
 is the accumulated merits. Accumulated merits, generally, in the general accumulated merits, but in

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:12.000
 the bodhijabhas, generally, those are known as fosterations, and offering purification,

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:19.600
 in the reusing and the teaching, remaining a long time, a long life, and then getting married.

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:19.760
 Those

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:28.720
 are known as seven techniques that will accumulate the great merits. Merit of the wisdom, merits of

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:35.360
 the accumulations. Both merits are generated. But this, that is generated, and this is again

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:41.040
 absolute level, according to the zoki level that you see here. You see, you see here. See here.

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:47.410
 And now, this song, again, with great understanding of the true nature, relaxing our mind in a

00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:47.760
 natural

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:55.360
 state of rakbar. Rakbar. So, first line, explain it. This 'a' starts with 'a', and that 'a' is the

00:31:55.360 --> 00:32:00.960
 absolute nature of our awarenesses. And then, first line, what's said here. Premodul Piyo,

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:09.120
 limited in Dakinis. Premodul Piyo, limited in Dakinis, is where is your rakbar. A mahi rupa,

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:15.360
 or our nature of the mahi. It's ordinary Piyo from the beginning. It's full of clarity,

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:22.400
 brilliant light as sunshine, and that is wisdom, Dakini. As I said before, that nature,

00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:27.200
 treat this Dakini, then follow an offering that you're making in the zoki levels.

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:35.920
 Zoki levels. For us, it is offering of the like here. Post-ration. See clearly nature as it is,

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:43.600
 is the homage of post-ration. And expanding the realization, and the realization and experience

00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:50.320
 is offering. Treat that Dakini, to clearly demonstrate Dakini. Which is absolute

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:57.840
 kurukul. Absolute rajim sodya. Absolute madatara. Absolute vedivari. Absolute brother, some of the

00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:05.840
 brothers. All the brothers. With that is absolute. So, you're offering that too. And, when you

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:06.160
 reach

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:13.520
 to the peak of the awareness, that is purification. There's nothing to purify. Nothing to purify.

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:19.360
 Reaching to the peak of the awareness. Nothing to purify is the purification. Great purification.

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:26.800
 That is not. Rapa is completely, totally believed. Right of status. And then what is the rejoice?

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:34.400
 Rejoice of the all the phenomena, phenomena and the grasping dualities are exhausted within that

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:46.080
 great awareness. That is rejoice. That is great joys. And, what is your recursing? Turning the

00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:52.880
 will of dharma. Dhamma. Turning the will of dharma as we use the word, mind to mind,

00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:58.800
 assimilation, lineages. There's nothing to see. Beyond the world. Beyond the Kavaluras.

00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:08.560
 Beyond any sentences. That beholding that absolute level as it is relaxed in that natural state,

00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:17.680
 merging into that natural state is the turning the will of dharma. Beyond any subject, object,

00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:26.000
 and essence. And then, what we are recursing? Recursing remains to the unchangeable state of

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:33.440
 all the remaining. Nature is already the unchangeable state. Rapa never changes. As we said,

00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:40.960
 all the teachings sit. Sit. So, recover, reemphasize, bring that realization again,

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:48.640
 being that state. That is the recursing. And the last one is the dedicating merits.

00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:55.520
 And all this meriture is where you're going to dedicate. It's to the dharma dattas. Again,

00:34:55.520 --> 00:35:03.600
 this is known as dedicating merit beyond any activities. Beyond the subject, beyond the object,

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:11.360
 beyond the activities. Subject, object, and essence. Beyond that. So, that means relaxing our mind

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:18.470
 in a robust status. That is a great dedicating. So, by simple it to tell, when we meditate, we'll

00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:18.560
 be

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:25.520
 able to meditate in a robust state. At that time, all this is a completion. Every meriture

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:26.400
 activities

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:33.760
 are completing. We're glorifying that nature. Nature. So, that is like Zocci levels of these

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:40.480
 practices. All these seven accumulated merits. One of those who don't, right in front of all,

00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:45.440
 these meditative, all these things you don't, in front of the mandala. And then he said,

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:51.680
 the object of, of the visualization, dissolve in the self-awareness, in this separate book,

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:58.160
 being purified, all obscurities are and we are blessed. Feel that going after you finish these

00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:02.640
 things, and feel that from the heart center or triple is of this buddha.

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:16.240
 [inaudible]

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:20.800
 That completely purified any reward there for the natures and the completely blessed,

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:27.680
 and then dissolve that, that each of those medal to you. And that, then, so that is what it is.

00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:33.520
 So, up to this point is we completed the postpartum of these practices with this.

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:40.000
 Now is the principle part of practices. Principle part of practices, and which is then again here,

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:49.280
 and how we're going to generate these practices. And then again, this is now said by his

00:36:49.280 --> 00:37:01.520
 [inaudible]

00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:07.360
 That means, first we are going to relax our natural state of mind, the absolute

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:13.120
 [inaudible]

00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:21.520
 is pure from the beginning, clear luminosity, uncontrived. That is absolute status.

00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:32.080
 That is absolute state of the kurukul. That is the nature of the kurukul. From that nature,

00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:38.720
 arising the display of the kurukul, from that nature. So, first we relax on the natural state

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:45.520
 of mind, as it is relaxed. If you'd like to do more kind of detailed way, and then in the Buddha

00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:51.040
 teaching, or Murugan Mahasamma teaching, or Nirma teaching, sit from that nature, then ask, come,

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:59.200
 tremendous power of the SNC, the power of display. And as he said, tremendous power of

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:06.640
 compassion arises from that nature. And pervasive to everywhere, and all everywhere, compassion

00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:14.800
 becomes as the sunlight of the morning, hit to all the skies, but this time, not just the only one

00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:22.160
 direction of the sky. The whole space is filled with compassion, lightness, and then fill that,

00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:30.000
 fill that compassion, be in that state. So, first we stayed on openness, on controversy over a big

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:35.760
 state of the emptiness, remained that state for a few seconds. After that great compassion energy

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:42.640
 came, pervasive to all that spaces, against a few seconds, have you like to do? And then

00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:43.360
 combination

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:51.040
 of that compassion and the great emptiness, appeared see the syllable, such as three, three syll

00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:51.360
ables,

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:58.960
 SNC, three syllables, absorbing, appears the syllable, radiating and absorbing as it.

00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:06.000
 That means radiating light from this rich syllable. Now rich syllable is the essence of

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:12.880
 loving kindness, the compassion, and wisdom, and rich syllable is our mind, our awareness,

00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:20.160
 that is rich syllable, is red, red color, or in the teaching said also morning sun colors,

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:27.390
 evening morning sun color, or evening sun colors, evening those sun colors, very billion rich color

00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:27.440
,

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:34.000
 powerful, and radiating lights, all by light, and multiple light, to when all the pure members,

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.000
 and the particular pure, that of Amitabha, in the gurukuli pure, and the gurukuli pure, and the

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:44.080
 gurukuli marsambhava, and the yachim sodya, and from their blessings, their blessings, the buddhas,

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:50.960
 bodhisattva blessings, came back to this three syllable, and that moment three syllables become

00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:56.960
 more glorified, become more strong, strong and more glorified, and now went to the all the beings

00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:57.040
 of

00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:03.280
 the six of them, light came and attacked, and purified, they are obscurators, obstacles, cause

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:08.320
 of obstacles, and obscurators, completely purified, and they were there by their nature, and they

00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:15.840
 returned back that light to threesome, that moment again has become so powerful, by doing this is

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:23.450
 called in the Buddha teaching, doing two purposes, two jobs, two jobs, two walks, making, glor

00:40:23.450 --> 00:40:24.000
ifying

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:30.080
 your enlightened calipers, and receiving all Buddha's empowerment to you, empower, and also

00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:36.320
 purify all the sentient beings, benefit to all the sentient beings, so immediately we are walking

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:36.560
 as

00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:44.080
 what the Buddha will do, what the Shaktamuni will do, or did, Buddha did, all contracted to the all

00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:48.880
 the Buddha's bodies of every enlightened beings, each time when Buddha gives the Sutra teachings,

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:55.520
 many times such as Amitabha Suttaras, Akkubiya Suttaras, maybe such as there is a Buddha Suttaras,

00:40:55.520 --> 00:41:01.360
 Buddha opened the entire universe of the doubts beyond that, and right in front of that, and then

00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:05.920
 Buddha gave the teaching, Buddha not really talking the story of the behind, seeing behind

00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:06.560
 mountains,

00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:13.360
 he bought that whole atmosphere right in front of the audience, and then Buddha gave the teachings,

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:18.720
 so this is what really we're doing right now, this case, and then what Buddha did,

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:25.920
 Buddha sent so many blind light from his chakra, or the third eye's bone, to all the beings of sex

00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:31.360
 ranks, remove the suffering of the difficulties, and then he turned all light, we're doing the same

00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:36.720
 thing as the Buddha did, this is the, their book where the Yara teaching is so powerful,

00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:43.520
 so speak, immediately you're going to the right target of the realization, heart of the realization

00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:43.520
,

00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:49.520
 immediately activating that realization, not let's sleep those colors, beauties, and then

00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:54.880
 right after that combination, that re-celeborn now, instantly become

00:41:54.880 --> 00:42:03.440
 kurukkale, yes, kurukale, kurukale, your saga, and how now you, how you are now kurukale status,

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:11.200
 kurukkale status, is dancing than the verse of the rainbow body, body of love and compassion

00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:16.960
 of vista, what are the three syllables? Three syllables is a combination of compassion,

00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:22.800
 wisdom, and love and kindness, that three syllables, that play word, that gauntlet,

00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:28.720
 never locks in when it becomes the whole, the figure of the kurukkale, it's the same thing,

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:35.920
 it's just that the display, shift, display expanded in the way of our kurukkale levels,

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:43.520
 otherwise nature is the same, it's love, it's compassion, it's vista, therefore it's called

00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:50.480
 dasudan, visto-reni, bodhis, bodhis, and then he has chosen all this explained here clearly,

00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:57.440
 clearly, and that is which you are now, you are rids dancing postures, on the top of the lotus,

00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:05.040
 and the sun dress, you are, you are the center of the universe, center of the medallas,

00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:13.040
 we are each of us, the center of our own medallas, medallas, and that is what you're going to

00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:13.920
 realize,

00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:21.600
 realize, and then, and nature of this again in the teaching said, said, blessed for us,

00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:28.960
 blessed for us, warm, warm and blessed for us, and residing in the midst of the rainbow light,

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:35.830
 rainbow light, and within the flames many times, in terms of, but in his only teaching here,

00:43:35.830 --> 00:43:36.080
 nothing

00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:41.040
 may happen about the flame, but the bookiers all the time, as most have some flames there, so

00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:49.280
 maybe let a flame, a mist of the rainbow lights, and that is the visualization, meditation of the

00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:56.640
 kurukule as your, now we are realizing this, and how we're going to make, keep this, maintain this,

00:43:56.640 --> 00:44:02.400
 this is the one teaching, said, now, we, if you like to let it detail, I mean every detail,

00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:08.000
 now, when you clearly visualize that deity as yourself, as kurukule status, and meditate,

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:13.920
 and from your heart center, three syllables emanate a lot of lightness, and when all different

00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:21.840
 pure lands, and particularly pure land of the Amitabha kurukule, and when all the blessings of

00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:27.840
 their body would speak, it was the mind blessing, they came back with white palm, red eye, blue

00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:28.080
 home,

00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:36.080
 merge to your three places, and then heart, and that moment truly you become the kurukule, so

00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:44.640
 Buddha Amitabha, Buddha kurukule empowered us, empowered, not just we are meditating in a kind

00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:52.960
 of like in that state, Buddha are now murdered to us, and we become truly as this, this,

00:44:52.960 --> 00:45:00.560
 and so with that realization, realization, and then we can keep up with meditation,

00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:12.560
 with confidence, with clarity, with purity, those are known as clay, pure stabilizing, those are

00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:12.720
 the

00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:22.800
 three principles, call it that makes a visualization, meditation, powerful, strong, deep,

00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:29.920
 and the first is clay, clay means trying to be clay regulators, and if you have to do this, many

00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:35.760
 times the teaching says look to the eye of the, or the face of the kurukule, or that deity, kind of

00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:41.520
 if there's good thangas, look to the face of the kurukulas, and all that, and then grade you the

00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:41.920
 kind

00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:47.600
 and close your eye, and bring that image to your mind, and then to the whole body of the kurukule,

00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:54.640
 clearly, kind of almost not staring to this, not blankly staring to those images for few seconds,

00:45:54.640 --> 00:46:01.360
 and then close our eye, bring that visualization, those are known as learning the clarity of the

00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:08.800
 visualizations, training ourself, which also means training our stabilizing of concentrations,

00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:20.240
 and the second is, is purity, purity is important, what is purity means? It means this is, kurukule

00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:27.100
 is pure from the beginning, kurukule is totally enlightened beings, kurukule is compassion, kuruk

00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:27.360
ule

00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:33.520
 is love and kindness, kurukule is wisdom, that combination is kurukule, so therefore it's pure,

00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:40.240
 it's just completely pure, pure and it's just a divine enlightened status,

00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:45.440
 during that day, because we already started from the level, what's it, from the emptiness,

00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:51.760
 and from there compete, no one there came up, realization, that is knowledge, purity.

00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:59.360
 The third one is stabilizing, stabilizing means our confidence, your confidence,

00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:08.320
 that means, you have to, when you realize American kurukule, you have to see yourself kurukule,

00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:16.640
 not lingering with it, with any intellectual thoughts or any constructions, be embarrassed

00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:24.320
 in that nature, be courageous, be confident, be strong, strong, your nature, our nature of the

00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:32.800
 Buddha nature is now wacked up in the state of the kurukule. So we are pure from the beginning,

00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:38.960
 from the beginning, the ordinary level thinking is pure, is our Buddha nature, our root, and now

00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:40.000
 pure,

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:45.040
 meditation level is pure, is wisdom in the combination and love and kindness, that's

00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:53.920
 what we started, and now we're realizing that is pure, still and therefore be in that state, truly

00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:59.680
 kind of be with confidence and that, that's in the teaching what's called Vedic writers.

00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:06.720
 So that is really about the body meditation of the kurukule. Now the speech meditation of

00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:25.440
 the kurukule we started with the second line of the Vedic Ed, the last line and then above that

00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:32.640
 second line and that's all. He said, "At my heart upon the sun dress is the shiad shek." From there

00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:38.560
 it's called practicing the speech of the kurukule. That means, now when we visualize this, this,

00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:46.080
 our root should be not limited, we should not limit the vedaya tiki. So therefore we're not

00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:52.800
 just going to feel ourselves only become kurukule. That is not. We're going to see entirely this

00:48:52.800 --> 00:49:00.800
 universe, the whole of our perception is the medaya of kurukule. Whole perception is purely

00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:09.280
 the whole of our kurukule. So that means the building, land, mountain, tree, everything

00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:19.680
 becomes the all that we can see by eye. The point, object of eye, is become the kurukule, the forms

00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:19.680
.

00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:25.920
 No matter what ever the shiads and formation, that's called the display. The display according

00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:32.400
 to our shiads. And that is, and that all naturally, even though they appear whatever that is,

00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:39.440
 naturally is loving-kindness, completion and wisdom of the great emptiness, as Aslusa states.

00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:45.360
 That is the one. So that is known as the body meditation of the kurukule. Now we're going to

00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:52.320
 practice speech meditation of kurukule. That means we're going to transform the whole sound system

00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:58.960
 as a voice, a singular voice of the kurukule. And the true student is to ignite that qualities

00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:04.720
 and then in the teaching city, I may already play, play here in our center. We're delighting

00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:12.080
 this kurukule mantra but counter-kurukule nicely and eliminating all the kurukule and every, that

00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:18.320
 power of this life from this mantra and mantra and a lot of lights coming from multiple lights

00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:25.840
 and that all completely completely come in a way of our power to everyone, everyone's

00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:33.840
 and came in a domain of ourself or yourself. So everyone and not just the essence of those

00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:41.680
 all essence of the universal form and so on and the spirit, essence that all merged back to your

00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:48.000
 heart center, which means three syllables, three syllables which is in your heart center, merged,

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:56.560
 merged, it can again glorify the kurukule natures. And as it is and what is that nature is innocent

00:50:56.560 --> 00:50:56.640
,

00:50:56.640 --> 00:51:03.280
 unchanging blessed emptiness, that is nature of the kurukule, unchanging blessing of the

00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:09.120
 infinite. This is not just a blessed emptiness only to ourself, the whole universe, the world, the

00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:09.920
 song,

00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:16.160
 everything transformed in that nature of status. Everything in the land of bliss for us of great

00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:21.920
 emptiness, in that sizzling energy of the enlightened qualities and all the suffering, the

00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:22.400
 difficult

00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:29.200
 troubles, instantly disappeared, a bird as morning sun, like heat as the darkness goes away,

00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:35.040
 instantly appeared, everything become in that reality of the great wisdom in life of status.

00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:42.320
 Truly it is all liberated, everything is overpowered by yourself. That s what you are

00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:49.440
 with great confidence and reciting these mantras. And that is then as many as you have time, 21

00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:50.000
 times,

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:56.560
 1 mala, 2 mala, 3 mala or whatever you have time and do this. And after you finish these mantras

00:51:56.560 --> 00:51:56.640
 and

00:51:56.640 --> 00:52:12.880
 then you have time, you have time, you can do those things. And after that, and then,

00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:18.960
 so that is really about the task forming, the sound systems of everything as the mandala of

00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:24.880
 the kurukule. So that means again, not just only our sound, our voice, but the whole sound systems

00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:34.160
 of the universe, whether this is the natural sound of the elements or that is sound of the wings

00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:41.200
 or combination sound, sound, all that transformed the mandala of the kurukule's sound speeches.

00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:49.040
 So that is so. And we did that and then we did that. So after you finish it and then now the second

00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:55.920
 part part of the practices, which means then activating the first mind of the kurukule's,

00:52:55.920 --> 00:53:02.080
 realization of the kurukule's. And this is then known as also absolute practices, practices.

00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:11.120
 And this is then now, now in the page 10. Page 10 and this is then you join for the aspect of the

00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:20.880
 deity, self-realizing awareness, dissolve vastness, pervading the non-dualic beyond. Join this,

00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:21.600
 this,

00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:26.960
 hold that kurukule. The moment you join that kurukule, hold the kurukule, the medala,

00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:32.000
 the consultant, that what we are holding is completely dissolved. Dissolve to the

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:41.760
 organ status, organ status where it started from, where all that shock begins, where all that

00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:54.320
 discipline begins, where that begins, and we move back to page 7. What is it? Uncontrived,

00:53:54.320 --> 00:54:05.360
 display or uncontrived emptiness. Uncontrived emptiness, it dissolved back. Uncontrived

00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:12.960
 fuel from the beginning of the emptiness is the basic ordinary nature status, where all the display

00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:21.920
 came, where all the display came, now went back to that nature status. This is not just only

00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:28.160
 has happened now, according to Buddha's teaching, the whole universe begins like that. All this

00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:28.960
 world,

00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:37.920
 the galaxy, the planet is, begins this. From the emptiness, from the space, it's magically

00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:48.560
 started forming that way and way is now. Everything is in spaces. Way it will go end to that space

00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:57.360
 in the larger levels, and our this level, again, where what we merited, is now verited back to that

00:54:57.360 --> 00:55:06.400
 great openness. We work from the beginning, great emptiness status, which is the essence of love,

00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:14.240
 essence of compassion, essence of the wisdom of great emptiness, without any divitable or any

00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:24.560
 sense in several, without any sense. What? Divisions. We don't need divisions. It's one with them.

00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:32.240
 We don't want this. That is what the nature is. It went back, relaxing that. This is what in the

00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:38.720
 generation of the Buddha teaching now is, the zogchen, the tucku, fuel from the beginning,

00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:47.120
 O Mahamudras, Pandya Paramudras, great transcendental westerns, what do those terminology Buddha

00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:47.440
 used

00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:55.600
 to bring up to our realization, to bring up this in like gods, so meditating that. That is the

00:55:55.600 --> 00:56:02.400
 essence of the kurukulis, western mind. That's the essence of our mind, nature of the warm mind.

00:56:03.120 --> 00:56:09.760
 Be in that status. Be in that state is known as meditation. The zogchen level, there's no

00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:18.960
 meditation with effort. Nothing to be effort. Be natural. Be relaxed. Be calm. Be peaceful. Those

00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:25.040
 are the reasons in zogchen teaching said many times, let it calm. Let it go. Be in that status.

00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:32.560
 Don't make any heart. Don't make any efforts. Harden effort, searching, engaging, trying to do this

00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:39.040
 in that old level of the mind, according to the zogchen point of view, according to the absolute

00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:48.560
 point of view. Be in that status as long as you have time. Time, time, and we disjoint these

00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:57.920
 fruity lines and by that reminder of this camera, usher us, ask to that status and be relaxed.

00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:05.840
 After you finish these practices, or after you have the kind of about time to end, then in a

00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:12.640
 teaching set, again by the creative power of the indivisible illusion of the kurukuli medalla,

00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:21.040
 if I add that word as commentary, indivisible illusion medalla of the kurukuli, of the form,

00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:30.080
 sound, space, mind, a period that entirely whistles and contains. That means whole universal world

00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:35.800
 everything comes in the display of the resistance. So that means all comes back again. I mean it's

00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:36.000
 here,

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:45.190
 it's now and it's gone, except our duality, our kind of focus, of that concentration is we dissolve

00:57:45.190 --> 00:57:45.200
,

00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:50.880
 mirrored to the request status. And how is it realized? It's at the display of the resistance.

00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:56.320
 Wisdom means it's not just a wisdom, it's a wisdom compassion,

00:57:56.320 --> 00:58:02.880
 wisdom with love and kindness, and wisdom is openness, and that is what happens.

00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:11.840
 To live, imposing that nature in the air, then several mantras, om is old, so old poems are

00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:18.960
 home of kurukulis. All are is all sound of kurukulis. Home is of all the space and mind is kurukuli

00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:18.960
.

00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:24.560
 With that understanding and here His Holiness teachings, our three doors and our body,

00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:31.280
 speech, mind are in that state too. See? And so that is the principal part of the practices,

00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:37.760
 principal part of the practices there. And now the concluding part of the practice is a dedication.

00:58:40.160 --> 00:58:46.880
 Then I speak with prayers, and which is already here, so I won't go more now. And so that is

00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:54.560
 bring my talks on these kurukulis practices. And then have you have some kurukus? We discussed

00:58:54.560 --> 00:59:02.800
 a short time. And then we practice this kurukulis talk with them, and then we do also some other

00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:09.280
 practice is done for us so thank you thank you anyone have any question yes
