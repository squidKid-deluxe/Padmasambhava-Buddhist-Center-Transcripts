00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.620
 We really bring up this Four Training of the Mind. Four Training of the Mind, all four renunci

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:09.400
ations,

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:17.550
 and this is the essence teaching of the Buddha's first teaching, "Suffering Truth and the Cause of

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.560
 Suffering Truth."

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:26.640
 That's what it is, the essence of that, in practical ways. Put that, practically by the greatest

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.480
 masters.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.560
 These four renunciations, we discussed this study. They don't say, "What means renouncing?"

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:41.520
 "Renouncing," that's what translated in the English at many times, and it is called "Lodoknambaje,"

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:50.280
 that will reverse our grasping, clinging, clinging. When we reflect on these four renunciations,

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:59.780
 the thought of this training of the mind, it will reverse that this grasping, clinging to the sams

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:00.320
ara.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:08.120
 Grasping, clinging, that kind of like holding, it really will reverse. That's what's called "Lodokn

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.960
ambaje."

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.700
 In the Tibetan, we use the word that "Lodoknambaje," "Lodoknambaje." "Lodoknambaje" means "mind." "

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.520
Lodoknambaje" means "reverse."

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:23.800
 "Nambaje" means four kinds of that reverse our grasping mind from the samsara, and which does lead

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.320
 into any, I think,

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:33.080
 poorly known session thought. Also, sometimes, it's named for training of the mind, although "Lodok

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.920
nambaje,"

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:44.000
 it will train our mind. That means it will bring our mind more gentle and peaceful, more practical.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.680
 First in time, we're not looking to that. Our duality mind let to ignore the reality level of the

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.680
 way things are.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:02.120
 Our duality mind looks like opposite. Let's look opposite and ignore the reality. Fact. Fact, let

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.760
 me ignore.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:12.000
 Always looking outside, ignore that. We'll look to close to this issue or this nature of the

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.080
 phenomena,

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:25.080
 it will make our heart more subtle, more gentle, more practical, and more graceful, more graceful,

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.840
 more richness, more precious.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:36.400
 It will become all that beauty. It will come like that arrow dance, that hovering attitude, thought

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.760
, looking to the other side.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:46.120
 It really will stop. For those reasons, those greatest masters named as for training of the mind.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:53.920
 We need trains. Think that. And also, many times, you will say, it's named as in the way that these

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.680
 four are named,

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:03.520
 named "Shenloknambaje." "Shenloknambaje." "Shenloknambaje." "Shenlomi" ain't well, well, kind of,

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.720
 you, you, well,

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:14.220
 you, it will make you not so excited with some sounds. Four-kind is not so excited, not so excited,

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.280
 not so kind of endlessly obsessed with that.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:27.780
 We think that. This. So what it does, it will bring us to home. It will, mind, our mind will bring

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:28.720
 to home.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:35.210
 We feel more richness, more appreciation. For example, thinking of the precious human body, what we

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:36.960
 discussed yesterday.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:44.470
 You know that. It's you all know. It's not something that you don't know. I'm talking. I heard. You

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.960
 heard. We all heard this.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:56.460
 But practice is what we need to do. Practice means what the great master Malaripa said in his

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:57.640
 teachings to the students.

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.140
 We're not too much, kind of, trust your confidence on this portraying of a mind. All Buddha said

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.760
 those, all teachings said that,

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:10.250
 all I read, this and that, kind of, like, loosely, kind of, very casual and unimportant. He just

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.000
 said, kind of, like, casual thoughts.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.500
 That's what really many times we do. Not just only we do, but in the, according to teaching, 18

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.440
 times those

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:28.940
 practitioners did too. You cannot ignore that. But this is really very important, looking into the

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:29.400
 fact.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.770
 And when we look to the thing of the precious human body, as we discussed, what it will bring. It

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.560
 will bring what it grateful.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:47.450
 Grateful, graceful, thankful, joyful. How precious it is, how important it is. I don't like to

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.720
 waste this precious moment,

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:56.680
 precious lives, this precious opportunities. Really, all the very practical issues are coming.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.960
 It didn't mean that we had to give every some sort of things. It didn't mean that. Read, for

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:02.760
 example, that

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:10.040
 life story of the great master, Master Lumkimas. All great master, Nimminamas. He is the house

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.160
holder, Nimminamas.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:20.050
 He is only the new religious. He is only the jin go mchhe ji, even in our lifetimes. There is a

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:21.080
 householder.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:28.280
 And then, as well as the great master, Mardas. And this, we didn't mean that we had to give up that

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:28.280
.

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:35.480
 But we're not just, kind of, obsessed and not appreciating, not reparating, not using these

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:44.360
 opportunities in progress. That is known as the tricks and the deception of the ego-claimers.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:49.800
 And then, also, next one, I will talk really about this, among the foreign organizations,

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:57.400
 about this lord of namma jai. It's impermanent. When you have the understanding of impermanent,

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:05.320
 again, we will be more appreciators. We use time wisely, opportunities of wisely.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:13.480
 And our gathering is precious. And your family's friend is precious. And our family and friend are

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:21.160
 precious. They're not going to be here forever, nor I am. But where we are gathering for the moment

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:31.480
 at times, we truly enjoy the lives. Celebrate. In a way, it is time to celebrate. Celebrating

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:37.800
 and fulfilling. Appreciating to each other. Echoing knowledge to each other. Respect to each other.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:43.640
 And purging to each other. And apologies to each other. All that is known as dhamma.

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:47.960
 And also, in the human world, those are known as good conduct.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:55.240
 As great master, Nagaruduna said, we have good conduct of the human beings,

00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:04.360
 human hope, what he said. Heaven is not power. Of course, in Buddhism, heaven made those God's

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:13.960
 rams. It means God's ram. So, God, we have the good conduct of the human beings. The God's rams,

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:21.320
 the shita heavens, and so forth. All those God's rams are not power. When you're standing tall

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:28.280
 and firm on the good conduct of the human rams and God's rams, then what Nagaruduna said? Narayana

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:34.440
 is not power. I said that yesterday and many times. Great Master Kenji in the Buddha said many

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:34.840
 times.

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:42.440
 It's true. Really, that is what we need. So therefore, the impermanent, when we start

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:49.560
 thinking, it's true. It's not just making up things. It's not just Buddhist phenomena or those

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:54.920
 who follow the Buddha teaching. It's not that phenomena. Not phenomena. It's everyone's

00:07:54.920 --> 00:08:01.880
 phenomena. Everyone in this universe or a core of Buddha teaching holds three rams.

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:09.560
 Impermanent is phenomena of all three rams. That's where things are. Everything.

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:17.640
 All impermanent. And that is what the teaching says in the Buddha's teaching. There's three imper

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:18.120
manents.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:26.840
 Subtle impermanent and gross impermanent. Gross impermanent, what we notice,

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:37.400
 ourself, because our duality mind is very gross. It's not really just a subtle. It's always gross

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:43.240
 and looking for that. That's what we see. But that gross impermanent is not just happened by that

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:50.680
 moment. It continually accumulated and continually developed. Continually changed. And that is

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:50.920
 known

00:08:50.920 --> 00:09:01.720
 as subtle impermanent. Subtle impermanent is the moving as first as instant. As our second,

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:11.080
 or when we look into the clock. The instant impermanent is the moving or changing as our

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:24.200
 the clocks. All our times. That's how it is. But no matter whatever it is, even if this is a big

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:31.000
 change, there's a lot of bright beautiful things. All can happen. Also again in the teaching said

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:37.320
 the great master Buddha Chakra Manoa, great teacher said because of impermanent we can make

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:44.280
 improvement. We can make a change. We can make change. And we use these opportunities. We can

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:53.800
 change that direction of the impermanent meant to the good purpose, good use, good be possible

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:59.880
 for all the beings. That's what you see. So that understanding and what the great master in the

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:08.040
 teaching practice lately said. Think of the impermanent. All this universe is impermanent.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:16.520
 The universe, the world where we are looks at it so tall and so concretely. It is impermanent.

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:23.800
 It is also not out of that subtle impermanent. It's constantly shifting and changing. And it will

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:33.320
 come to the end. What in the Buddhism called end of the eons. It will break that. So this universe

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:33.400
 is

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:44.040
 impermanent. That's it. Then we take all living beings inside this universe or in this universe,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:54.760
 this living beings, also impermanent, impermanent. And then in the Pacific we take all those great

00:10:54.760 --> 00:11:03.560
 leaders, the most powerful man on earth. Earth, those great leaders, even we heard names,

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:10.360
 kind of can scare those individuals also impermanent. They came and they're gone.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:17.560
 And they know not just only that, but all those holy beings, noble beings,

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:29.160
 all those great beings according to Buddhism, Buddha Shakyamunas, 500 arabas, 80 Mahasiddhas

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:38.920
 and as well as all those great scholars, great masters, masters, Naropa, Telopas and all those

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:45.400
 great masters. Also Naropa. And then in the Duretha Phongs, I mean in the Buddhist history,

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:54.040
 all those 25 disciples. I mean everyone, they are affording the teaching and they have the

00:11:54.040 --> 00:12:01.880
 capability of shifting and changing the four elements. They can transform and change the four

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:10.200
 elements. Fire, they can turn in water. Water, they can turn on the wind. Wind, they can turn in

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:10.440
 the

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:17.800
 earth. They have to completely control the four elements or the five elements. They cannot be

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:28.840
 destroyed by the fire, water, wind, earth. Anyways, but still they are on our bone and left on our

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:35.240
 sides. And then also in Christians or other religions, such those great beings, such as Jesus

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:35.640
 Christ,

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:47.150
 all those great beings, same thing, things. So this is how everything is in these changing

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:47.800
 situations,

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:53.640
 changing. And then our own memories, for example, thinking of the immersivity,

00:12:54.440 --> 00:13:00.920
 how many things have changed? Since in our memories, even our look into our physicals,

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:10.760
 how many things have changed? Time we are babies and until now, how many things have changed? How

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:17.160
 many things have changed in our environment, our experience, our understanding, idea, philosophy,

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:23.480
 all those, each time they're so solid, so true, so kind of stable and this and that. All this

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:33.480
 here, change, we look back to all that. And so everything is really like that. I mean, all this,

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:41.480
 this is known as impermanent, impermanent. But reflected in mind, thought to that, what it makes,

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:51.400
 makes ourselves more practical, more peaceful, more grateful. Where we are all together,

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:59.560
 when everything is in our head, when everything is in our control. How wonderful, how beautiful,

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:07.880
 how spectacular it is. Our life is also a fright. I mean, because of that, all is a fright. It has

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:15.160
 what the great master said, Arya Deva, who is one of the famous masters in the Indian of Buddhist

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:27.000
 historians and the foremost disciples of the Narayana, he said, this life has more obstacles

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:35.160
 than the supporters. If there is pure supporters than the obstacles, even the poor supporters

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:42.040
 can become obstacles. Even poor supporters to our life can become obstacles.

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:52.280
 Even that situation, still our life is continually shining. How wonderful, how beautiful, how

00:14:52.280 --> 00:15:00.440
 graceful. And for that reason, again, Narayana himself said in a teaching, teaching as I just

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:09.720
 letter to his friend, the letter to his friend, this life has like, it's like surrounded by life,

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:18.680
 life of life. I said, no, no, no. This life is like butter life. Our life is like butter life.

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:28.520
 It's life is so many heaviness that we are, this life of butter life is completely surrounded by

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:40.680
 wind, trouble is wind, trouble is wind. And wind looks like how it is, but still we are breathing,

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:47.320
 we have time to sleep, to wake up, all that even is surrounded by all that, that situation.

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:55.400
 Still this life is shining. How wonderful, how beautiful it is. That's what really Narayana said.

00:15:55.400 --> 00:16:02.120
 This is not what Narayana said and Aryadeva said. It's true. They're talking true. They highlight

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:10.840
 things where things are. Our duality mind don't hope, don't see that. We ignore that. We've many

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:17.480
 times, we've asked times. Something that we can maybe do. Many people in our life, if we look back,

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:25.080
 many times with a lot of things, of course, we use so wonderfully beautiful our life, many things.

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:30.680
 But if we look sometimes, some of those lives, what we did, wasted in the way, really wasted.

00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:37.160
 There's no benefits to me, to the others. Maybe somebody need to become the disturbance to me

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:43.320
 and to the others or to ourselves, to the others. So reflecting of the empowerment,

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:50.600
 always in the teachings it will make it calm, peaceful, practical, and it also will bring more

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:57.960
 joyful effort, more courage, more commitment. And for that reason, Buddha Shakyamuni said,

00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:04.480
 in the teaching, he said, among all the conceptual thought, thought, the thinking of the imperman

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:04.760
ence

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:11.560
 is supreme. Among all the conceptual rhythms, thinking of the impermanence, reflecting the

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:18.520
 impermanence is consumption. But this conception is supreme, that's what Buddha said. And it's

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:26.760
 put also, put also that, among all the footprints, the elephant print, foot print is supreme of the

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:35.000
 being. Thinking of this impermanence, it is so special. We are also reflecting to the nature.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:41.400
 When we think of this, when we think of the precious life as it in doing it, precious human body,

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:48.600
 and then when we think also impermanence, it really makes ourselves more calm and more peaceful,

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:55.960
 more graceful. We will use this, our life, something more better and beautiful. For those reasons,

00:17:55.960 --> 00:18:01.720
 and the great master in the teaching said, his foreknowledge of thought is, foreknowledge of

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:11.800
 thought or this foretraining of the mind is head, head of the practices. He said, we have that is,

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:19.310
 and we have that foreknowledge of thought, then we have the head, will do better, all the last

00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:19.720
 things.

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:25.720
 So is it? In the way we have head. And for that reason, many times in the teaching, he said,

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:32.120
 always reflect this foreknowledge of thought. Bring more joy, every session in the teaching said,

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:38.520
 every session. If we have this foreknowledge of thought, it makes our calm, more peaceful,

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:44.760
 more stable. At the same time, when you have this attitude or reflecting of this mind, how practice

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:51.320
 will go more, more efficient, most beautifully. And we have that thought that ending, at the end of

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:58.680
 the session, it will make more calm, peaceful, and a dedication that all can practice completely so

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:04.760
 beautiful. That's what the early teaching said. So that is what even we practice of the Zochen,

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:13.240
 we should always have those thoughts. This is looking to our own really where things are

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:18.600
 and reflecting where things are. It's not just ignoring that. So with those thoughts,

00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:32.760
 with this thought, and then you will start with those thoughts. And again, I will go with it.
