NOTE     "description": "On July 19, 2014 at Padma Samye Ling during the Annual PBC Summer Dzogchen Retreat, Ven. Khenpo Tsewang Rinpoche taught the essence of the Jewel Garland of Four Dharmas by the great master Longchenpa.\n\n1. Bless my mind to turn towards the Dharma.\n2. Bless my Dharma practice to follow the path.\n3. Bless my path to be free of delusion.\n4. Bless me that all delusion be transformed into wisdom.\n\nThe Jewel Garland of Four Dharmas is the condensed practice manual of the nine vehicles to enlightenment including sutra, tantra, and Dzogchen, describing their view, meditation, conduct, and fruition. It does this primarily by explaining the techniques used at each of these stages for removing confusion about the abiding nature of reality, and revealing the inherent purity of oneself and all phenomena.\n\nLongchen Rabjam Drime Ozer' (1308-1364), was the reincarnation of Princess Pemasal, the daughter of King Trisong Deutsen and direct student of Guru Rinpoche. His birth in the Tra Valley of Southern Tibet was accompanied by miraculous events and auspicious omens. He began his Dharma training at the age of seven, when he received empowerments and teachings from his father, a tantric yogi. At twelve, he took novice monastic vows at Samye monastery.\n\nLongchenpa studied and practiced teachings from a variety of lineages and masters. He received and mastered so many teachings, in fact, that he became known as Samye Lungmangwa, the One of Samye with Many Transmissions. Though he is associated primarily with the Nyingma lineage, he also studied many teachings of the Sarma, or New Schools, including the Kalachakratantra, Ch\u00f6d, and the Path and Result teachings of the Sakya lineage. He shared a particularly close relationship with the third Karmapa, Rangjung Dorje, with whom he studied under the Dzogchen master Rigdzin Kumaraja.\n\nRigdzin Kumaraja was Longchenpa's most important master. He lived with him for two years, practicing the Dzogchen teachings of the Heart Essence of Vimalamitra under extremely harsh conditions. Rigdzin Kumaraja eventually empowered Longchenpa as the lineage holder for these teachings. Longchenpa also reawakened a connection with the Heart Essence of the Dakinis, the Dzogchen lineage of Guru Rinpoche, and practiced these teachings for years in isolated mountain retreats.\n\nLongchen Rabjam's influence upon the Nyingma lineage is unparalleled. He united and compiled teachings concerning the two main Dzogchen Heart Essence lineages in a work entitled Four Volumes of the Heart Essence, adding three commentaries of his own to the teachings of Guru Rinpoche and Vimalamitra. He also wrote the famed Seven Treasuries, texts that present various aspects of the view, meditation, and conduct of the Nyingma school's nine vehicles.\n\nLongchenpa passed away at the age of fifty-six. He left over 250 treatises behind, many of which are still regarded as the most comprehensive and authoritative works yet written concerning the view and practice of the Great Perfection. His most important students include the 3rd Karmapa, Rangjung Dorj\u00e9, with whom he exchanged teachings, \u00d6zer Kocha, and his son, T\u00fclku Trakpa \u00d6zer.",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.900
 Many years ago, and I had a great opportunity, unfortunately, to join with him, standing with him,

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.660
 and discussing this teaching.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:15.260
 And also I received this teaching quite a few times from his own Dunyurumri, who is the master of

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.180
 the old Dzokhi teachings,

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:25.840
 and the regent of the Guropean Masambha, one of the great masters of the 20th century, of the

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:26.000
 Tibetan Buddhism.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.700
 From him, I also received these teachings. So this is the kind of breathing of this teaching.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.800
 And this teaching, then, is what this teaching is connected to all those five categories.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.700
 This is connected to the entire Buddha teaching.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:46.600
 Buddha's day one teaching to enter Mahaparin nirvana, all nine jhana teachings.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:54.100
 This teaching is the essence, the contents, practicing manual, practice and instruction,

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:00.800
 bit and stroke of the nine jhana teachings, if I say so. That is what it is.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.900
 And why he wrote this? Because nine jhana teaching is a big, Buddha teaching is a big,

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:12.140
 according with Tibetan Buddhism, there is over a hundred canons, a hundred books, over a hundred

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.100
 warnings.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:19.600
 This says, "I have the Guropea." It is a hundred, put in heaven, something, warnings.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.100
 That is the Buddha teaching to oscillate a little bit. We go through these old teachings.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.400
 Even we have the Guropea effort, we don't have enough time to go through these teachings.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:36.660
 This, therefore, condense it. This is the condensed essence teachings of all that the Buddha

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:37.600
 teaches.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.460
 And what is the meaning of this teaching? Then the meaning of teaching is the condensed teaching of

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:43.100
 all,

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.900
 from the beginning of the Buddha teaching. How the Buddha, he condense it?

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:54.900
 This, as we write, is called dhanas. As we write, it is our booklet. Where is this?

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:05.400
 This is, page 50, page 50 of our booklet. Page 50.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:16.900
 Bless, bless my mind to turn the total dhanas. Bless my dhanas practically, follow the path.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:25.900
 Bless my path to free of the delusions. And bless me that delusion be taskful into the wisdom.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.900
 That, that is the teaching, the meaning of this teaching, this goodness.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.900
 So that means, turn the total, how we turn our mind to dhanas.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.400
 That means, how to turn our mind to our own nature.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.400
 We are not just wondering, hovering to all terms surface, outside.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:57.400
 But how to turn to our sun, to our own heart. Heart. How to really do this. How that works.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.400
 And when we turn our mind to our own heart, to our own goodness,

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.900
 how we like to be continually, propose. Even we have the good motivation,

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.400
 even we have the good fortunate that we receive the teaching, all that our mind has.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:18.900
 We have so many challenges in some surface. So many distractions. So many, enticing.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:27.900
 Intoxing, right? Intoxing distractions. Just, easily we've got to carry with us forces.

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:34.400
 But how we stay, continuing our course. Course.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.400
 And then, even we stay in a course, even we stay in a continually with that detrimental thing.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:49.400
 And we can be caught again with some illusions of the side trucks. Trucks carried away.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:55.900
 And that is what pre of the delusions. Because our delusion, what we have up in the bed,

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:03.900
 is not just start only these items. From the beginner's lot of times, that is how it came.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:11.400
 And then, finally, how this delusion everything. To transcend that back to the natural status.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:17.400
 Where ordinary delusion came? Came ordinary. Primarily.

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:25.400
 It's from ordinary nature of our own mind. This delusion is not creation of the song outside.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.400
 It is our own grace. We are the creator of our dreams.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:36.400
 Whether that dream is a good dream. Whether that dream is a corrupt dream.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:46.220
 Whether that dream is a nightmare dream. Our self is the producer, creator, the engine of our

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.400
 dreams.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:55.400
 When they are coming from their dreams, even if we experience all those variety, vividly things.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:05.400
 It is from nature, from our mind, evenness of the mind. All that is showing up this.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:14.400
 And where that display is continuing, that display is continuing with our mind, space of the mind.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:21.400
 And where that is dissolving, going back, where it is going, back to that space of the mind.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.400
 That's the reality. That is nature.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.400
 Many times, we follow carried by the force. We follow with trapped by the shadow.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:36.400
 And then we kind of shadow, and shadow becomes so strong, and our own shadow.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:42.400
 Shadow, and then we begin to suffer. We begin to torment it.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:52.400
 We begin to carry with force. And faith is our shadow, our own, our fundamental primary.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:57.400
 It's our own, my own, my own.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:03.400
 And how to let it go, that is called wisdom.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:10.400
 Nature is pure. Pure from that's what the Indochi teacher always repeatedly.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:16.400
 And we've heard so many times, the great masters. Pure from the beginning.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:23.400
 Origin and nature, dharmadhatu, primordial nature. That is coming.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.400
 So have let it go. That is the wisdom.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:34.400
 It's not something the worst of aliens coming to rescue us. It's our own nature.

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:39.400
 That is what this teaching is. It's already translated.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:43.400
 You know. I mean, you read. That's what it's teaching is saying.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:50.400
 This is what the great master unchi vatok. This teaching is good to all the practitioners.

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:56.400
 Beginner practitioners, middle practitioners, very advanced practitioners.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:00.400
 All those who have been beginning of the practicing is good.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.400
 Those who have been practicing for a long time, this is good.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:08.400
 Practicing, like highly patriotic, still is good.

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.400
 Good. It's a source of paper practices.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:18.400
 So that is a brief introduction part of talk.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:25.400
 And then tomorrow we do the empowerment of the Buddha Amitabha,

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.400
 which is one of the very special.
