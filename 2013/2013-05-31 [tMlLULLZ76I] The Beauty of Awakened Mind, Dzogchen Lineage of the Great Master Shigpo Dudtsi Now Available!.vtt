The Nyingma kama lineage began with Guru Padmasambhava, Shantarakshita, Vimalamitra, and Vairochana in the 8th century. From the time of Guru Padmasambhava and for at least three centuries afterwards, everyone who attained enlightenment in Tibet did so by practicing the kama lineage teachings of the Nyingma school. In the beginning of the 11th century, the first terton Sangye Lama appeared and revealed terma teachings that came from Guru Padmasambhava. Many other great tertons followed him and their teachings spread widely, so that by the 14th century, the terma teachings eclipsed the kama in popularity, and great tertons were more celebrated than kama masters. In many ways the same holds true today. Yet despite the widespread practice of terma, the kama and terma lineages have never actually been separate; in fact, kama is the very basis of terma.\n\nIn July 2009 at Padma Samye Ling monastery and retreat center in upstate New York, Ven.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.740
 Thank you, everyone for coming. And I already want again a beautiful announcement. This is the new

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:13.160
 book.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.580
 The new book is called the "Beauty of Awakened Mind". It is by Dzogchen lineage of the great master

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:29.360
 Shopu Dudtsi.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:37.280
 Shopu Dudtsi is one of the great masters in 11th century Iran, and he was one of the great masters,

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.320
 particularly among the Dzogchen teachings. He is renowned as one of the great lineage holders

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:48.800
 of the mind sections of the Dzogchen teachings. And this is one of the, again, legges of our great

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.560
 teacher Keni Fadahir Rinpoche. He always has the interesting thought that you should mention

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:00.240
 to bring up the spotlight of the great master 18 times. They have been so important and crucial

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:06.560
 for the lineage, yet even many practitioners of the Nyingma Buddhist practitioners even don't

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.840
 remember the names of these great masters. But he'd like to bring back those in the spotlight

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.820
 and remember their finest, how important they are in the lineage of Dzogchen. And we practice Dzogc

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:18.080
hen,

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:25.840
 they are the real length to these masters. And so this is one of his teachings. And I'm very

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:34.400
 fortunate. I had so many great masters who kept so kindly and dearly in their wings. And I asked

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:41.040
 that, and I had a great opportunity to stay under the wing of Keni Fadahir Rinpoche, so many years.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:48.000
 So I had also even my names here, able to join with his great legges in the Western Compassion.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.920
 And this is the Shapudu teaching. And this was, again, last couple of, many hours devoted Sangha

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:03.360
 members, and then added by Richard Sternberg many times. And the beautiful Gower, look at this,

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:10.320
 this Gower is trusted. Gower is like almost kind of coming out to this, this really world. And then

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:16.320
 of course, along the all the way that Raupa stated behind the way, every project, every activity is

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.600
 so kept up and both these results. So I think to all of them, I'm making three names, but there's

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:28.480
 so many Sangha members involved with this. So I'd like to thank everyone. It is one of the legges

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.400
 and one of the beautiful offerings to the lineage and also one of the great deep practice of those

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.320
 who are interested in the Dzogchi teaching or the Buddhist agenda. So thank you, and I make this

00:02:40.320 --> 00:03:06.320
 offering again in the name of everyone. Okay. We all do.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:28.320
 (Singing in Dzogchi)

00:03:40.320 --> 00:04:00.320
 (Singing in Dzogchi)

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.880
 Thank you everyone again. I think it's already quite late. Maybe we don't have to schedule an

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:06.320
 evening practice.

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.320
