00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.560
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.000
 My name is Pema Angchin.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.840
 I'm from Bhutan.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.400
 I have been four years being a nun.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.640
 I decided myself to be a nun because I like him.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:26.640
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.760
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.120
 My name is Dolly Carlisle.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.440
 I am from Sikkim.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.400
 I have been here four years in Nunnery.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.920
 I like studying with this philosophy.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.100
 My name is Pema Angchin.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.480
 I am from Bhutan.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.880
 I came here in 2003.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.240
 I have been four years in Varanasi, five years in Varanasi.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.360
 And I came here with my brother.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.360
 And when I came here, I found him in Nunnery.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.800
 And I joined in Nunnery because I like Buddhism.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:19.200
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:27.320
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.520
 And what is it you like about Buddhism?

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.080
 Why do you like it?

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:42.480
 I like mostly philosophy and practice to do the meditation.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:48.280
 And do the practice every morning, every night.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.800
 First of all, let me introduce myself.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.840
 My name is [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.160
 I am from Bhutan.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.680
 I am 13 years old.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.120
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.920
 I like to be here.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:21.820
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.560
 And tell me where you're from.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.200
 I'm from Sikkim.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.480
 And how long have you been here?

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.360
 Two years.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.840
 Two years?

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:30.640
 Yeah.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.640
 My name is Pema Angchin.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.320
 My grandmother was dead.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:40.640
 Then I want to be a nun for my grandmother's ambition.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.040
 And then I want to be Dharma for her and as well as my mother.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.960
 And I like to be a nun forever in my life.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.160
 And Nunnery has been named organ Samyachakulling.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.920
 Nunnery, Saranath, Varanasi, India.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.760
 This is the original building here,

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.160
 which is a three-story building.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.600
 That is the original building where the nuns live.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.240
 And now we've built this, and they'll be moving in,

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.600
 I think, this week or next week to this building.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.700
 It's already been finished.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.120
 It's almost two years now.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.080
 But Tempos have waited till Kempo return

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.000
 here to do it more formally, so to give the senior nuns a place

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.560
 to be and to be close to the library and the temple.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.040
 So we're really happy that we've been

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.160
 able to make the trip here.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:40.560
 So it's 2.08, and we did the inauguration of 2.06.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.920
 It's very quiet, very beautiful.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.120
 Kempo, one hour and a half seconds.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.200
 These are different poems, like those young nuns wrote.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.360
 And Samyach organized them here in college.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.600
 He's teaching, teaching, and this title of the board

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.200
 is called The Garden of the Knowledge.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.460
 Knowledge, this is the drops of the garland,

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.160
 garden of the knowledge, I think.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.000
 That's it.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.600
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.640
 Anyway, this is [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.320
 Even you have the wealth, every wealth,

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.560
 but how long that will last?

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.320
 And therefore, it's better to do the practice.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.720
 And then learn the song on your [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.640
 And when you have the good fortune, everything comes.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.680
 All the luck will come.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.360
 While we check that out, the [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.880
 When you leave this building, there's nothing you can take.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:46.320
 Even the one, the tip of the needle, you can't take.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.760
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.080
 And therefore, those who are you keep the wealth,

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.200
 all this wealth with which you met so much heart share

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.800
 that you got better to do the generous practices.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:09.280
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.280
 And where there's beautiful temples and beautiful--

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.640
 those sangha organization is good to do offerings

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.560
 and [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.320
 And then it will bring the joy and peace

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.320
 and remove all the obstacles.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.560
 And it's also like good [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.200
 in the next life that we pray.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.520
 So those are all beautiful.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:39.520
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.080
 OK.
