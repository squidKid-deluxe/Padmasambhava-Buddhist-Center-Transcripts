00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.080
 The nature of the mind, of course there is many different ways of explaining that, but this is

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.500
 really directly connected to the tradition, primordial wisdom.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:17.830
 And then this is the relative teaching of Dzogqin, Dzogqin teaching, Taqiu teaching and Togga

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:18.000
 teaching.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.670
 Togga teaching. And now the fourth is Taqiu teaching, because Taqiu is the foundation of the Togga

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.000
 practices.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 And that is here, mentioned, Kumsijapu in the Tibetan and in the English.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 All creating monach, monach, monarch. That is very important.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.350
 These practices, when we see this, we have to know really with confidence, have to have confidence

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.000
 on teaching the practice.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:03.190
 Okay, monarch of all creation, all creating monarch, all the monarch of all that creation, in a way

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.000
, I think.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 So the happy thing then, that is, of course, I said yesterday, and you all know, is mind.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 Now you really see, is mind is creating everything.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 The larger level and the variousness level, we should have confidence in it.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.450
 That means we should have this confidence with our knowledge, with your own knowledge, is true or

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:32.000
 not.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.200
 This is the Buddha teaching. And as the Buddha taught, also we really have to see if this is true

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.000
 or not.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 So creating everything, our. And the larger level, all the samsara is created by the mind.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.970
 And the small level and the short distance level, and our all activity is regulated and created by

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.000
 the mind.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 Is it true or not? Do you think that?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 Mind is, whatever we've propagated, physically or verbally, it all comes from mind.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:19.410
 Mind is really created everything. So that means samsara is created by mind, nirvana is created by

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.000
 mind.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 Our all activity, virtues, is created by mind, and our own virtues is created by mind.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 And that's really the mind.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 This, of course, we've heard so many times. Do we have now kind of have confidence? It's true.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 So that means our motivation, our mood, M-O-D-E, is also created by mind.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 There's nothing else not created by the mind.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 Happiness is created by mind, sadness is created by mind.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 Mind. So every level is really created by mind.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 That is really, we shouldn't have confidence, not intellectually, having kind of vague knowledge.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 When we see that as truly as it is, then we will be better off. Really, we will be good.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 We won't make too many mistakes. Or we won't too much, kind of feel grasping, holding to mind.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 Because it's our mind is created.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 So put that reason here, kumzi yapo in a debate came up for the monarch of all creations.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 The monarch of creation is created everything, our feeling in a person.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 Then he said, gozong. He said, and gozong to all of that.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:07.150
 So it's sovereignty of your three doors, discerning, I think it's discerning to your, so that means

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.000
 analytically.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 Analyte exam of your three doors, which is principle.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 And that means again, it's mind.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 That's principle is mind.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 Among three doors, body, dog, body, speech, and mind.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 Our physical, our speech, and our mind.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 Among that is mind is principle.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 Body and our physical and our voice is attendance or servant of the mind.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 Whatever the mind directed, whatever mind says, the body will go and verbal will speak.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 With all that, the body and verbal will not perform the activities.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 So that means mind is principle, and to your other is attendance and service.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.220
 And again, there's so many ways, you know already those so many times, so I'm not going to talk too

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:28.000
 many things.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 And again, it's coming later too.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 But it's true or not, you have to have confidence.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 It's not just on the intellectual status.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 Really you should have confidence.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 Trust, see that truly.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 That is called practitioner's, your practicing.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 Not just intellectually like that, see knowledge or something, and then don't.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 And therefore, we like to control, we like to have good conduct.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 Conduct is generally appearance.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 Conduct is appearance.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 Mind, nobody sees.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 That's what the teaching says.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 Maybe some other can see, I don't know.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 Some certain people can tell.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 But otherwise, mind, nobody can see.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 But body activity and verbal activity, many people will see.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 So therefore, if we like to have good conduct, that please our own self and as well as others, then

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 take care of the mind.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:51.800
 And for that reason, the great Master Shanti never said, when you don't know the secret of the mind

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:52.000
,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 mind, those who would like to have the happiness, and they would like sadness or trouble,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 then they're not really, they don't, they just endlessly waste their time.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 That's what the teaching says.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 Maybe you understand what I said.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 Me, the happiness and the mind, sadness are absolutely dependent upon the mind we would like to do.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 This is our mind.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 And we like to have the happiness, take care of the mind.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 And we like to avoid the sadness and troubles, take care of our own mind.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 By who?

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
 By ourselves.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 That's the teaching, it's true.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 All this, conduct is an expression of the mind.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 Therefore, people will say, oh, something if you do, oh, that person has good heart.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 How they know they have good heart?

00:07:52.000 --> 00:08:01.320
 Because activity is coming by verbally, physically, something appealing, and again and again, that

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:03.000
 person is a good heart.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 Heart, the person, and the activity is coming from the disturbance to the others, again and again.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 Then, people will say, oh, that person is bad.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 The good and bad is not on the surface.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 It's all in the mind, with how we take care of our mind.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 Again, this has to be confidence. We have to have seen this is true or not. Ourself. Really.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 See that truly, and then follow that.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 When you know that, you follow with that.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 Then that is called practitioners.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 Practitioners.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 Practice makes perfect.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 Then we practice.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 Then ourself becomes perfect and perfect, more perfect, more perfect.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 Good things, all that.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 So that this is.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 Then, next one.
