00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.320
 You know, Kedokar Machamimid, the great scholar and the great Siddha, the greatest scholar

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:15.840
 that we know of all the five sciences or five art of science, major sciences and the five

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:22.240
 manual sciences that he master of all those knowledge. But not just only that become the

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:28.880
 intellectual on the brain, waves of the brains. What he learned, he absorbed in the heart.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:39.680
 That where we become the Droga, Kedokra Siddha. So he is master, scholar of the scholars and Siddha

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:47.840
 of the Siddhas. This great teacher put all the entire practical aspect of the Buddha teaching

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:55.920
 so simple, so special that we can use that as daily our practices and we can carry all that

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:03.200
 fit and structure pointing out as he said pointing out to the old lady's style is the best way

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.480
 and we like to make the difference in our lives. That's what he said in the beginning time. So we

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:15.440
 move forward with these these teachings. Now with this teaching, with this teaching as I said many

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:21.280
 times and you know, but however again following the footsteps of the ichin, those great masters

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.600
 in numerous schools, they always reject back where we came from when with teachings. So in that way

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.280
 with this and also reminded of entirely this teaching how much all these things. So this

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:40.880
 teaching has simply say like add songs, add great songs and among that add great songs, we

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:41.840
 completed

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.360
 four songs. We went through those. We went through the essential point of the meaning of

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:54.880
 teaching that we can highlight that can benefit. Maybe we didn't go word by the words exactly but

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.520
 as soon as your meaning of this teaching and then of course this is commentaries here too

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.600
 that you can look to the two commentaries that but it is the essential point highlight of that

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:12.400
 and the first one is then positive song is so important to receive the teachings but that is

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:19.600
 more important to practice. One of your practices is so important we could put bring all practice

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:27.280
 more simple so something that we can handle we can put that into practice not just as a record

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.680
 or the list of the of the you know our notebooks but something that we can really put make tangible

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:40.560
 that's what we need to begin to that and then that is the second and third songs and that third

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.960
 second third songs is the teachings on the pacifically known as pole renal sessions. All

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.520
 that regularly also is known as teachings of the buddhas plus for novel through the teaching among

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.080
 the pole novel through the teaching it is the teachings on the suffering truth and the cause

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:02.400
 of suffering truth and kind of reflecting on that wherever and then third so the next one is the

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.640
 pole

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:09.520
 fourth one is the teachings and then we follow the path now path through and then we follow the

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:15.680
 path through we will reach the nirvana or the enlightenment and the realization and that is

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.840
 then there is two stages one stage is known as the kind of spring that all entirely buddha

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.520
 teaching to simplify that simplify that and which is known as the hundo practices in a general

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:34.240
 way practice practice you practice the lineage term hundo practices and that is what all that

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:42.640
 port chapter is practice and today is what we begin teachings on the the essentially meanings

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:49.440
 of the of the inner thunder teachings teachings on the virtualization and teachings on the

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:56.480
 conflict stage is practice teachings that is essentially meanings of the in the particularly

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:03.360
 inner tantras and then as well as also essence of the mahayana teachings now what this great

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:09.440
 master did and what buddha did actually what buddha did first this teaching was what

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:16.080
 teachings we repeat many times is teachings on pole novel truths he gave the teachings on the

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:24.320
 pole novel truths pole novel truth is generally very kind of simple it's communicated with us

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:30.720
 very quite easily is teachings on the suffering truth and teachings on the cause of suffering

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:38.000
 truths why buddha give teaching american before too but buddha don't want to keep something hiding

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:45.760
 generally when you go to the expert therapists what they do first they're going to reveal the

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:52.560
 all the toxic things that is hidden under our physical or mental states they're going to reveal

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:58.320
 that they're going to speak out that you're going to pull out not going to hide that and hide that

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:05.040
 and hide that and cover up the cover of gold you're going to bring up that that is post treatment

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:12.000
 when we go to i think treatments all this what they call natural things detoxications

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.480
 when you go to the detoxications first you have to bring up whatever it is toxicated

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:27.440
 you have to bring these suffering truth cause of suffering truth they are like trouble matters

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.920
 they made us talk we're trying to cover up cover up cover up been doing that all the time

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:41.760
 since the big list until now trying to cover up but that didn't work put that many lifetimes

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:48.080
 nor did this walking in this life we're trying to cover up cover up therefore with courage and

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:54.800
 commitment we are going to face into the challenges of the what the reality is so we can uproot and

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:01.120
 clean take care so that we're not just a kind of timmities behind the scene trying to hide that is

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:10.080
 ego activities ego activities ego is manipulation is in one way is very timothy but it is always

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:17.040
 spoiling and diluting that therefore what that's what the Buddha gives the teaching

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:24.240
 a first product of teaching is a form of truth once you take care of that aspect of the of the

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:32.400
 nature of realities then Buddha went deeper and which is known as second turning will of dharma

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:42.240
 and that teaching is something quite beyond of our normal conceptions we can't immediately can

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:49.600
 understand that common conception regular duality kind of regimented duality nor cannot accept

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:58.000
 immediately and what is that that is known as great emptiness the great emptiness emptiness

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:05.520
 of any solid existing things and substantial solid existing things anything external that

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:11.360
 exists is true there's no substance that can exist if you look to that these days modern days

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:15.920
 through the scientist 100 years ago at the scientific or maybe more than 100 years

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:24.000
 scientific began to have began to do the revolutionary in common words they both those

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.240
 those qualities is there's no substantial solid existence now they're talking about what i don't

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:36.560
 know much about but you know more the strength you use all that but there's no substantial solid

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:43.440
 existing that that is what is and behind the strength theories what is there

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:50.640
 have you go further than strength theories quantum physics is distinct theories what is there

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:57.920
 this is not just only there starting areas there but this is all this galaxy the universe

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:07.760
 what we see what we think or what we hear the all is the same then not just the only the object is

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:17.360
 that but the subject itself one is looking that strength to you one is discovering that the

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:27.920
 quantum physics theories that intelligence is the same nothing difference you check that if you

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:28.640
 find

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:38.240
 nobody find it i'm what's what i've been i've been einstein i've been einstein did not find it

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:48.880
 carl carl seagull i think who was great professor in the corner universities i think he didn't find

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:55.280
 and i'm you know i'm sure you know more those great now modern those physics quantum physics

00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:04.560
 scholars they do the same thing even they don't want to omitting of the what the subject is

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:10.080
 or they maybe they don't like to hold on to that but there's no difference it's the same

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:16.720
 that's what what buddha give the teachings everything is open everything is infinite

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:25.280
 everything is freedom there's no structurally regimentally forced and standing resistance

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:34.160
 is all open that's what the buddha lead to like to show the nature where things are that's what

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:41.040
 again buddha is known as the great teacher who showed exactly where things are for those reasons

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:47.840
 buddha you want in the buddha's teaching always not overstated not understated or i use it many

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:56.640
 times the world world exaggerated in a deeper case deprecated exactly as it is not hard not

00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:04.000
 look as it is that is the one that is the the hallmark of the great teacher of the buddha

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:11.360
 the greatest symbol of the great teacher or the sign his hallmarks should exactly at is is also

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:19.600
 elite that is skillfully as we advancing we are ready to accept we ready to adjust that knowledge

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:29.280
 but that's what keeps this and now then it's not just that empty empty in open status now talking

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:37.760
 about more now source of all that visions the source of that strength use source of the

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:46.960
 content present reasons or the nor of the content reasons nor of the strength use which is what is

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:55.920
 that and that is this mind as i said the nature of the mind and strength use or whatever they

00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:04.320
 form is safe there's no differences but but mind is something more than the what you see in

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:04.960
 external

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:19.200
 objects the strength use mind has the inconceivable call it and knowledge knowledge and power power

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:29.760
 is something unique mind therefore mind is known as then the buddha nature a awakened natural mind

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:36.720
 has the awakened energy waking natural which is inseparable with that openness natural

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:46.080
 that freedom natural it's not burdened that the awakened energy is not burdened not blocked the

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:52.880
 the freedom of the mind the infinite of the mind now from today here the great master

00:11:54.560 --> 00:12:05.520
 going to begin that teaching how this mind is so special how this mind is so can emanate

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:15.360
 anything that what we like to see it is everything and this is mind is everything and mind is your

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:24.640
 mind is the center of your your universe and my mind is center of the my universe and mind is

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:33.040
 everything from there every our perception conception our activity begins from this

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:40.240
 emptiness mind from this awakened mind and therefore mind is a center of our

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:51.680
 kingdom or our kingdoms or both it is the hour of yours and that is the what great master begins

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:59.200
 in order to begin this again in order to explore this nature this teaching buddha talk third turn

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:05.760
 first turning will so the second turning will of dharma and then as well as third turning will of

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:12.560
 dharma and then all the video on the teacher the buddha talk now is the same nature is the same

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:21.920
 only where we discover where we connect that for nothing naturally change any circumstance

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:25.360
 anyways in order to begin this you know
