00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.360
 And so we all have that sincere intention and request that our precious teachers can have

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:24.720
 long life continue to teach and turn the wheel of Dharma, which is also taking that into our

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:34.000
 own minds and hearts. And may it be reflected beautifully and clearly absorb into our minds

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.960
 and our experience to be truly of benefit to all the boundless beings. So just kind of

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:48.400
 as we always do before any study, before any contemplation, before any practice, it's really

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:57.680
 always because it's the start, it's the path, it's the fruition, you know, to really connect

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:05.920
 with our motivation, our motivation based on our joy, our appreciation for this special,

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:23.040
 precious, rare, fleeting moment, touching on the nature with minds and hearts, softening,

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:31.440
 welling, spreading with bodhicitta thoughts and great love, great appreciation, devotion,

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.760
 trust and confidence in the true nature. So as much as we can connecting with the Vajrayana

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:48.560
 vast view of how everything appearing is a pure forms of enlightenment. All sound is

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:59.680
 the timeless, essential, perfect teaching, resounding and awakening. All mind and space

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:08.000
 is the natural seat of the purity of all the phenomena arising, inseparable from bodhicitta.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:40.880
 And so we've been going over the nundra practice and the basics, you know, kind of reflecting

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:48.640
 on the structure and the meaning of the different sections. We've briefly gone over, of course,

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.480
 not only in our nundra sessions, but so much the really vital importance of really reflecting

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:01.040
 on the four thoughts that turn the mind through the Dharma, reflecting on our freedoms and

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:16.640
 endowments, on impermanence, on the infalliability of karma and the nature of samsara, which

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:27.640
 is suffering and misunderstanding, misapprehending, suffering. So this, which naturally softens

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:34.120
 our heart and minds as much as we can kind of recollect those at the beginning of any

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.760
 practice or study, but as well as bring that out throughout the day, you know, our teachers

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:46.040
 are always encouraging, bringing that out really sets us on the path because we're seeing things

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:56.760
 as they are, which gives us, I think, a natural affinity to looking even more the beautiful

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:09.040
 view that the Buddha gave us in Dharma. So turning our minds towards the inner extraordinary

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:16.360
 foundation practice of the nundra practices, which as we've been going over more partly,

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:22.520
 at least I've been kind of trying to touch on refuge and the section of refuge. And of

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:35.120
 course, how that refuge is the gateway to all Buddhist practice, study and realization.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:43.240
 And that means it's not just a stepping stone. It means it's the full path. When we take

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:50.380
 refuge from now until attaining enlightenment, we have the amount of joy, appreciation of

00:04:50.380 --> 00:05:00.440
 trust, confidence, closeness feeling to the Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, you know, that we,

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:07.080
 we can move towards that away from what's unreliable towards what's reliable within

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:12.400
 the Buddha, within the Dharma, within the Sangha. And then within our practice here, this is

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:21.080
 embodied as none other than Guru Padmasambhava, embodiment of all the Buddhas of this time

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:27.040
 of all the Buddhas of the past, all Buddhas of the future, inseparable from the precious

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:36.520
 teachers that actually appear in our life. So that really, the gateway and what keeps

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:46.320
 that vast field of merit, accumulating our merit and wisdom is really is our trust, is

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:53.360
 our devotion, which again, in the Buddhist way, that means we're examining, we're learning,

00:05:53.360 --> 00:06:07.040
 we're keeping open, we're exploring, you know, we're trying to increase our wisdom. So basically

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:13.560
 we've gone over a little bit, you know, on the outer level, the Buddha, who is the Buddha,

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:22.480
 what is a Buddha, we've gone over the Dharma, you know, in different ways, and we can do

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:28.040
 plenty more with all these things. But maybe on the outer level, the outer Dharma, all

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:33.760
 the teachings of the Buddha and Guru Padmasambhava, which can be all summed up into, you know,

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:40.680
 the three baskets, or the three trainings, you know, because there's both within Dharma,

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:46.320
 there's the words, and then there's the realization. And that's our contemplation and our training

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:53.400
 that brings up that realization. So training in conduct, no matter where we, in all of

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:59.720
 the aspects of the Nainanas, all the teachings on conduct, what to accept, what to let go

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:07.200
 of, all the teachings on concentration, developing our concentration. And then most important

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:16.360
 and most essential, you know, is bringing out our wisdom of knowing, seeing how directly

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:24.920
 how things are. And having more and more confidence with that, the more and more we engage and

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:33.080
 explore with open mind, open heart, and we're supported on the outer level by the Sangha,

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:39.800
 by all those from the time of the Buddha appearing into the world, up until this day, it's due

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:44.800
 to the Sangha, like we kind of reflected a little upon last week. And of course, many

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:52.200
 rich aspects to the Buddha Dharma Sangha. So we've reflected a little on the outer,

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:58.120
 outer three jewels embodied as Guru Padmasambhava, the Buddha, the Dharma, the Sangha. We've

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:05.680
 also touched on a little bit about the inner three jewels, which are also known as the three

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:15.880
 roots, the Guru, the Deva, the Dakini, the source of all blessings, the source of all

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:22.440
 accomplishment and realization, the source of all enlightened activity is the nature.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:29.320
 And of course, in our practice, that's the Guru, the Deva, Dakini, or in Tibetan, the

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:43.160
 Lama, the Yidam, and the Khandro. That's the inner kind of how the Guru Rinpoche embodies

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:49.720
 the Buddha, the Dharma, the Sangha, the Guru Rinpoche embodies all of the Gurus, all of

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:57.240
 the mandalas of accomplished accomplishment of all of the enlightened mandalas of the

00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:03.200
 deities, all enlightened activities of the Dakinis are embodied inseparably within Guru

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:15.480
 Padmasambhava. Now the inner aspect of the three jewels and the three roots is then,

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:21.960
 or I'm sorry, I said the inner, maybe we're looking at outer, inner, secret, absolute,

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:27.800
 it's kind of just looking at those little frames to give our conceptual mind a little frame

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:33.720
 to reflect as we go, as we're reflecting on the beautiful qualities and abilities and

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:43.320
 powers of the three jewels embodied as Guru Padmasambhava. So the outer, inner, outer

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:53.480
 three jewels, inner three roots, secret, is then the beautiful, pure nature of our own

00:09:53.480 --> 00:10:02.520
 body and that's fully developed within Guru Padmasambhava. So that's in the aspect of

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:14.200
 thinking Buddha that the essence element, the essential element of our life force is

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:23.600
 like the Buddha completely purified as is in Guru Rinpoche's case and then that essence

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:31.800
 element pervades our whole, the sacred mandala of our body. It moves through that by the

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:42.960
 winds, by the energy moving and that is the winds, that's the Dharma, that's the mandalas

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:55.600
 of the deities. And then those essence element is moved by the wind through the channels,

00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:03.840
 which is like the Sangha. This is on the secret level of the three jewels, the three roots,

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:10.760
 the winds, the channels, the essence element. So just briefly going over these, as we've

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:17.000
 all heard some degree of teachings on these, but just remembering this is what we're having

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:27.040
 a great trust in, in these teachings, these practices and their realization. In the absolute

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:37.640
 level we're taking refuge absolutely in just our timeless awareness inherent in every single

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:45.560
 being whether they've realized it or not. Our Buddha nature or as we're called in our

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:57.800
 practice Rigpa, our awareness, the essential essence which we have some degree of confidence

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:04.960
 in the view and actually we see the great realization in these great masters realizing

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:21.840
 the absolute Buddha is Dharmakaya, realizing that the Sambhogakaya is absolute Dharma. The

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:38.600
 Manakaya is the absolute Sangha. All mind, all space, all movement, all speech, all phenomena.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:47.720
 Or another way of looking at that is the vast vastness, empty aspect of even our own mind

00:12:47.720 --> 00:13:00.240
 is the Dharmakaya, we take refuge in. Inseparable from that, that clarity, the arising energy

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:10.480
 is the Sambhogakaya aspect. And then of course then that all-pervading compassion, our whole

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:23.560
 experience is the nirmanakaya or our nirmanakaya. And then this great three-caya Buddha of our

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:30.160
 guru Padmasambhava is appearing before us. Again it's recognizing it or not. And then

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:36.760
 we've been giving the gifts and the opportunity to practice all this. So just kind of bringing

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:43.920
 together these aspects of the three jewels, the three roots, reflecting as we do our practice.

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:50.440
 I'm just saying let's do that as we do that. Reflect on the outer Buddha, inner Buddha.

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:57.120
 I mean it's our outer three jewels, inner three jewels, secret three jewels, absolute

00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:04.960
 three jewels. That's our practice. And then of course the other thing I thought to just

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:12.720
 look upon today is because of course as we do our practice, we're the refuge. Traditionally

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:20.400
 we're doing prostrations. So I just thought again our time is short and I know we're really

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:26.960
 being encouraged to practice more than just talk. But I thought I'd go over real briefly

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:37.880
 just a little bit on the actual practice of prostrations, which we do with that. So as

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:44.720
 we are in that part of the practice, prostrations we know there's three kinds of prostrations

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:49.800
 we do. And of course prostrations are the gestures we make with our body. That's kind

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:55.960
 of what we think of mostly when we think of prostrations, right? Holding our hands, touching

00:14:55.960 --> 00:15:03.480
 our three centers, touching our five points to the ground, that's that outer prostration.

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:13.160
 We'll go over that briefly. But then on the inside, again everything that's a motivation

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:21.440
 that makes all the difference, the inside prostrations are coming from having reflected

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:29.240
 on the Dharma, the Buddha, the Dharma, the Sangha, the lives and examples of all the

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:40.400
 great masters. That joy, that appreciation, that trust is what's animating our practice

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:52.080
 as we're going. That's what's happening inside with our prostrations. And then we have our

00:15:52.080 --> 00:16:01.620
 body moving, we have our speech, we're reciting these two simple lines but so profound, so

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:08.480
 concise but so rich in meaning of what we're doing. So we can really reflect on that as

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:15.440
 we go, but we're prostrating also as much as we're making these gestures of devotion,

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:24.360
 surrender with our body. We're also reciting with our speech, you know, the expression

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:33.540
 of our joy and our appreciation, our courage and our commitment to the path, to enlightenment

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:40.240
 for the benefit of all beings. That's what we're doing every day, again and again, reflecting

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:47.780
 on these things and making, connecting with that joy, appreciation and commitment expressed

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:55.960
 with our voice. And then of course with a mind full of joy, devotion, appreciation,

00:16:55.960 --> 00:17:02.520
 so we're doing that. And they say too, you know, the benefits of prostration, all the

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:09.400
 all Buddhist teachings, right, are removing our obscurations and bringing out our innate

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:17.880
 goodness qualities and abilities and power, realizing the enlightened body, enlightened

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:25.480
 speech, enlightened mind, enlightened qualities, actualizing enlightened activity, which is

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:31.860
 nothing but bodhicitta activity, more and more and more natural. And so that's also

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:43.520
 the benefits of prostrations is that we're uprooting and knocking down our obscurations

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:50.240
 and our obstacles. So they say in general, of course, we're purifying our ignorance,

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:59.760
 our attachment, our anger, you know, all the five poisons are kind of uprooted in Dharma

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:06.160
 practice. And bringing out all, you know, the five wisdoms, we move through the five

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:20.560
 paths and 10 boomies until we realize Buddhahood become objects of refuge. The main, one of

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:27.320
 the main really renowned things that prostrations and praise does though, among all of removing

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:36.900
 all our negative habitual patterns and emotions, is really helping knock down our arrogance

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:44.880
 and pride. You know, not the natural good pride of having some respect for ourselves,

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:57.600
 but the arrogance where we actually cut ourselves off from growing, you know, like a cup turned

00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:09.680
 upside down will never get and be filled with anything except shadows. So anyway, so we're

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:17.280
 kind of, they just in the teachings, prostrations are really helping to uproot our habitual

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:24.320
 pattern of specially our arrogance. Why? Because it's not just knocking it down. We're actually

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:31.240
 thinking, exploring, like really recollecting everything we've heard and learned and practiced

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:37.240
 all the great examples, you know, it's all coming into the practice we're doing, reflecting

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:44.000
 on all the meanings. And then we're keeping with it as we go. I mean, anyone who's done

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:52.160
 prostrations, especially many, it's a very skillful means activity. So anyway, so we're

00:19:52.160 --> 00:20:00.440
 also working with that. And then, so maybe we should, I don't know, is it worth time

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:09.800
 wise getting up and doing, or maybe just when we get to prostrations? Yeah, well, I'll just

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:15.840
 say briefly, just since we're doing a little summary of things, you know, so they say to

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:23.800
 the benefits of prostrations, they say even in the teachings, just holding, you know,

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:32.120
 progressing with our body, holding our hands to our hearts before like a representation

00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:41.760
 of the three jewels, of the three roots has vast, vast benefits the Buddha said, you know,

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:51.170
 such as we're born into good births with healthy, beautiful, healthy bodies and wealth and

00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:52.520
 intelligence.

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:58.160
 And, you know, the ability to communicate beautifully and meaningfully, and with more

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:05.840
 and more devotion, and a lot of outer attributes that are kind of wonderful, but the real benefit

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:13.000
 of that is what is we're actually able to share that we're able to share the Dharma

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:22.880
 to share, you know, just health and wealth and wisdom, you know, so gloss over that quickly

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:31.480
 because our time is there. But then again, deep down, like when we're, we're standing,

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:40.000
 we have our, our hands in what's called the blooming lotus mudra, the blossoming lotus

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:46.320
 mudra, or you know, hands aren't totally tight together or way apart. It's kind of like a

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:55.920
 lotus bud beginning to bloom, holding at our heart, right, the seat of our essence element

00:21:55.920 --> 00:22:03.040
 and Buddha nature. And then, then we make, again, I'm reviewing kind of obvious but just

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:11.360
 again, connecting all these words I've been saying with our crown chakra, our speech chakra,

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:16.960
 our heart, and then we put our five, five points to the ground. And here, we're doing

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:24.280
 full prostrations. So we'll get to that. But when we, they say too in the teachings, when

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:32.440
 we're putting our, with devotion and joy and reciting, putting our, our hands to our crown,

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:41.850
 it's also removing all of our body obscurations, to our speech, moving all of our speech obsc

00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:42.480
urations,

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:50.920
 to our heart, removing all our mind obscurations. When we put our five, our five points to our

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:59.040
 forehead, our two hands, our two knees, stretched out on the floor, we're also just surrendering

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:08.200
 all of our five poisons, removing all of our, our ignorance, all our aversion and anger,

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:16.800
 all of our arrogance, all of our attachment, all of our jealousy, all our doubt and hesitation,

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:23.040
 releasing. And that means we're also, again, we're not just getting rid of anything, we're

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:27.680
 removing what's unnatural, we're bringing out and creating through our intention and

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:34.280
 our motivation and our joy and devotion, that beautiful connection to receive all the blessings,

00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:43.760
 the body blessings, the speech blessings, the mind blessings. We're, we're to receive

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:54.280
 all, you know, realizing all the five wisdoms, move through all the five paths, bring out

00:23:54.280 --> 00:24:00.480
 all the qualities of the five caayas, which means bringing out our enlightened, our own

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:10.360
 innate enlightened body, speech, mind, full of enlightened qualities and natural bodhicitta,

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:18.200
 enlightened activities. So we're removing, just like the word Sanjay, removing our obscurations

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:27.240
 are being completely purified, and we're bringing out the full bloom of all our own realization,

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:36.280
 creating the circumstances of generating our merit through connecting with our joy, our

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:50.120
 trust and keeping with the practice. And then they say, yeah, so I'm going to start talking

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:59.840
 and we should just do practice soon. So I really do want to keep time for practice.

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:05.960
 So when we get up to do prostrations, we'll maybe just go over those outer things and

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:11.240
 we can just bring up a couple little points when we do that, if that's not too distracting.

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:19.120
 So thank you. Of course, there's always more to say, but that's what's so beautiful about

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:29.960
 the Dharma, but relaxing. One more really vital important point is to as we're doing our practice,

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:37.800
 relax, even though this is very vigorous physical activity, which helps purify, you know, like

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:45.360
 I said, our three doors, straighten our channels, let our winds flow clearly, let our essence

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:55.960
 element just shine more brightly and balanced and centered. Also reflecting whatever pith

00:25:55.960 --> 00:26:03.400
 instructions, pointing out instructions we've had, remembering that absolute refuge, even

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:14.960
 as we're prostrating, just trying, even though there is the dance and the display of subject,

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:23.480
 I'm prostrating, you know, objects to Guru Rinpoche, you know, and the action of prostrating

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:31.440
 and reciting and emanating all of our bodies, trillions and billions and millions of times,

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:36.600
 all of our own bodies prostrating together with all the beings of the six realms. While

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:45.560
 all of that display is happening to reflect on those essential instructions that are beyond

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:55.960
 object, action, just that vast, open, quiet, spacious nature of our mind is connecting

00:26:55.960 --> 00:27:01.200
 with that as much as we can as we are doing all of our practice. But here we're talking

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:11.080
 about refuge, taking refuge in that, which means relax, reflect on that. And the transcendental

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:17.800
 wisdom rainbow display of every, all the skillful means we're doing to help bring out our wisdom

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:25.960
 and our compassion. So we'll sit for a couple of minutes and then we'll start our practice.

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:35.400
 I think everyone knows we're in our Trisharnundra. I think we have time again today. We'll just

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:43.520
 do the seven line prayer and then go to the quick lineage prayers and then go to the calling

00:27:43.520 --> 00:28:11.320
 of the Lama from afar. Again, reflecting on the meaning as we're reciting.

00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:36.120
 [silence] [singing]

00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:52.920
 [singing]

00:28:52.920 --> 00:29:02.920
 [singing]

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:09.720
 [singing]

00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:17.720
 [singing]

00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:29.720
 [singing]

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:40.520
 [singing]

00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:50.520
 [singing]

00:29:50.520 --> 00:30:05.320
 [singing]

00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:15.320
 [singing]

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:26.120
 [singing]

00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:36.120
 [singing]

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:44.920
 [singing]

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:56.920
 [singing]

00:30:56.920 --> 00:31:04.920
 [singing]

00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:17.720
 [singing]

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:27.720
 [singing]

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:40.520
 [singing]

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:50.520
 [singing]

00:31:50.520 --> 00:32:01.320
 [singing]

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:11.320
 [singing]

00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:22.120
 [singing]

00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:32.120
 [singing]

00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:42.920
 [singing]

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:52.920
 [singing]

00:32:52.920 --> 00:33:03.720
 [singing]

00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:13.720
 [singing]

00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:24.520
 [singing]

00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:34.520
 [singing]

00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:45.320
 [singing]

00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:55.320
 [singing]

00:33:55.320 --> 00:34:06.120
 [singing]

00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:16.120
 [singing]

00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:26.920
 [singing]

00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:51.720
 [singing]

00:34:51.720 --> 00:35:16.520
 [singing]

00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:27.320
 [singing]

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:41.320
 [singing]

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:52.120
 [singing]

00:35:52.120 --> 00:36:02.120
 [singing]

00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:12.920
 [singing]

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:22.920
 [singing]

00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:33.720
 [singing]

00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:43.720
 [singing]

00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:50.920
 Freedoms and favorable conditions of this human birth are extremely difficult to obtain.

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:55.320
 Everything born is impermanent and bound to die.

00:36:55.320 --> 00:37:02.120
 The results of virtuous and unvirtuous actions which are causes are inexorable.

00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:07.720
 The three realms of cyclic existence at the nature of an ocean of suffering.

00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:20.520
 Remembering this in my mind, turned towards the Dharma.

00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:36.520
 [coughing]

00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:43.320
 And again, feeling the presence and seeing the refuge tree before us.

00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:47.320
 Rising up from great, glorious lake in the jewel.

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:55.320
 Lotus stalk with five branches in the center is Guru Padmasambhava in all his glorious splendor.

00:37:55.320 --> 00:38:03.320
 Above him all the great lineage masters of this ocean lineage.

00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:14.120
 With all the Buddhas of the past, present and future to the side.

00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:19.320
 Along with all the Arhats and Bodhisattvas to the other side.

00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:27.320
 All the Dharmapalas and the deities of the three roots before.

00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:31.720
 All the self-resounding Dharma texts behind.

00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:37.720
 And then with our own body, with our Mother and Father of this life to our sides.

00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:42.520
 And all the infinite beings of samsara before us.

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:46.520
 And then emanating our body again with the instructions.

00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:50.520
 We'll do the prostrations with refuge.

00:38:50.520 --> 00:39:00.520
 Again, the essence of refuge is joy, devotion, trust, confidence, commitment.

00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:04.520
 Bodhicitta.

00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:42.520
 [music]

00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:50.520
 From now, until attaining the heart of enlightenment, I take refuge in the lama, the three jewels.

00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:58.520
 From now, until attaining the heart of enlightenment, I take refuge in the lama, the three jewels.

00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:09.320
 From now, until attaining the heart of enlightenment, I take refuge in the lama, the three jewels.

00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:15.320
 We'll get up and we'll do maybe about five minutes or so of prostrations.

00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:19.320
 Like I said, I'll just also just say a few points.

00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:23.320
 I think everyone's somewhat familiar, but I know some couple people had asked some questions.

00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:28.120
 But just we'll go over that, too.

00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:34.120
 I don't know, too, if the camera at where it is works or if someone just wants to lift it up.

00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:42.120
 I'll just go through that.

00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:48.120
 So we can all get up and do.

00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:56.920
 But it's one thing when you're doing the prostrations here at Padmasamyaling.

00:40:56.920 --> 00:41:02.920
 We have this nice marble floor, which when we're just doing a few prostrations,

00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:04.920
 you don't really need anything.

00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:08.920
 But if you're doing a lot of prostrations, when this is good, if you have a hardwood floor

00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:12.920
 or whatever, having a smooth surface is good.

00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:18.520
 Especially if it's stone or something cold, it's good to have a little padding.

00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:25.720
 So if you have a towel or a blanket, you can fold just to the width of your body.

00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:31.720
 You can also then fold it a little bit more to give your knees just a little bit of padding.

00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:33.720
 Then you have that.

00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:38.920
 And if you have some gloves or oven mitts or something, it can help make your hands be able to

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:40.520
 slide on the floor easily.

00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:55.320
 And also just protect your tendons and things from the cold.

00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:59.320
 Can you see here?

00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:01.320
 Should I move it all?

00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:03.320
 Come here.

00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:05.320
 So anyway.

00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:09.320
 I think we know when we stand, we want to stand with our...

00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:12.520
 Again, our motivation is most important.

00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:21.050
 But then too, instructions, keeping good alignment, really glorifying our joy, our devotion, our

00:42:21.050 --> 00:42:22.920
 courage, our commitment.

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:33.390
 So we want to hold our bodies well for the well-being of our body now and also in our future lives

00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:34.120
 as well.

00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:45.570
 So anyway, having our feet below our hips and together, not spread out or pigeon, but our knees

00:42:45.570 --> 00:42:50.120
 above our toes, standing.

00:42:50.120 --> 00:43:05.040
 And then, like I said, I'm holding this now but I want to hold our hands in the lotus blooming mud

00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:06.120
ra.

00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:22.680
 From now until I take refuge in the llama, the three jewels, going out, stretching all the way out,

00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:26.120
 coming quickly up.

00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:36.120
 So again, bringing our hands to our three centers, looking out.

00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:38.120
 I think we all know.

00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:45.120
 But as we go too, just really being careful with your body, you can kind of adjust as you go.

00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:52.740
 Kind of hold yourself up a little bit and lower yourself down and spread out so you're not always

00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:55.120
 rocking back and forth on your knees.

00:43:55.120 --> 00:44:04.380
 You can adjust and then be careful with your hands, letting your hands really be together, stretch

00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:05.120
 out.

00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:13.070
 And I say too, the blessings we bring to the environment when we do full prostrations, it just

00:44:13.070 --> 00:44:17.120
 brings every atom, just brings so many blessings.

00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:22.780
 In fact, I think some great masters said that if we knew more about the benefits of doing prostr

00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:26.120
ations, we'd wish our body could stretch further.

00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:33.120
 So anyway, now we'll just do this for a few minutes.

00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:51.120
 From now until I take refuge in the llama, the three jewels, going out, taking refuge in the llama,

00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:51.120
 the three jewels, going out, stretching all the way out.

00:44:51.120 --> 00:45:20.120
 All right.

00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:49.120
 All right.

00:45:49.120 --> 00:46:13.120
 Thank you.
