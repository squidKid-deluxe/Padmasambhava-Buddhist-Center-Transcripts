00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600
 This retreat, this retreat, and they had a lot of record of the resume teaching, but if they didn't

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.800
 put the practice, that won't help completely as we wanted it.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:16.000
 Yeah, but practice is simple. I mean, practice is so important, and practice is also simple.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:25.520
 Don't touch the best foundation. We call it the common or general practice, such as bodhisattva,

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.200
 poor boneless thought, poor renunciation thought.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:32.510
 Those are what the many times we call those, those are basic. That is so important, basic is the

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:33.400
 ground.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:40.280
 From there we have to develop. We know the best, basic things, really, it's hovering, it's hovering

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.400
 in the sky, it's not settled.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:48.310
 And therefore, then most of we leave this world, a world with empty hands. There's nothing much to

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.600
 gain.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.200
 And also we heard so many times, but we didn't have the confidence to practice it.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.200
 Therefore, we don't have much confidence when you leave this world.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:06.290
 So therefore, practice is so important, and with devotion, with joy, in appreciation, bodhisattva,

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.200
 and then with this world, in three various stages, or three caste stages.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.200
 So those are kind of activated those, as this is part of our practice in the meditation.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.200
 And the target is now, we go to the zuki teaching.
