00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.400
 Thank you. Good morning everyone. Thank you very much for coming. Thank you for participating.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.700
 Thank you. Thank you. I thank you very much. You are welcome.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:22.780
 Before I give the empowerment, of course you all know I am going to offer the empowerment of the d

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.700
orje sambal or the Vajrasattva.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:34.960
 Sadon, before that I will give the Briman and Todosan, which is part of the ceremony, so I will

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:35.700
 please look.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.200
 Now, again, always in the teaching measures and always those great marks of the measures,

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:51.100
 auto-releasing, empowerment, or starting, meditating, whatever we do, Dharma activities always to

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.200
 increase and activate our motivation.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:00.700
 Again, beautiful motivation of the joy in the appreciations and thankful, grateful.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:07.190
 All those are the basic foundation of Dharma and not just the foundation, but those are the really

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.700
 central columns of Dharma.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:20.760
 Every day every more joy in the appreciation, more grateful. More grateful to our circumstances and

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.200
 the situation of the sorrow we are.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:34.200
 It is really Dharma. It is. It is foundation, not just only basic or those are basic things.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:41.570
 This is the basic, this is the principle of our practices. All what are the teachings are best on

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.700
 those.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:49.200
 This beautiful motivation, joy in the appreciation, being grateful, grateful, that is so important.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:58.530
 We talk it with that and bodhicap. Again, of course we all know, we all know too and we heard so

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.700
 many times how much we are activating that bodhicap.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:06.190
 And particularly during the practice and meditation, we can activate both each other, then all our

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.200
 practices really will become so perfect and beautiful.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:17.230
 And we think again this today we are going to visit the involvement, connect with the Buddha Veda S

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.200
ato in order to benefit all living beings.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.690
 Sincerely thinking to all that, benefit means what? Remove their suffering, the difficulty of

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:25.200
 troubles.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:31.690
 Not just of the movement suffering, difficult troubles, but cause of suffering, cause of troubles,

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:32.700
 difficulties.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:40.410
 Those are negative emotions, negative emotions. We these Veda Sato practices, Veda Sato regime

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.700
 involvement,

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:48.540
 made that become one of the instrumentals to play away all the troubles, the difficulties of the

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.200
 sentient beings and as well as this world.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:58.390
 There are so many troubles happening around the world, man-made troubles, those are most of the

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.200
 best of the negative emotions.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:06.690
 Not just the most, I shouldn't say that, all is best of the negative emotions. Really, that

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.200
 negative emotion is where it started.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:17.200
 According to we all know, it started from the mind. That mind is emptiness, that's what we learn.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.200
 There's no substantial solid core, existing of the mind.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:29.200
 So the negative emotion is the illusion, but there are so disturbances through this illusion world.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:35.200
 And therefore we activated joy and appreciation, being great folks.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:42.200
 It's good for us, for ourselves, good for other beings, to families and friends, to everyone.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:48.200
 This is where we are teaching, in a sense, we are teaching.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:55.910
 And therefore, again, activated of the purity nature of the way this all phenomena exists, all

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.200
 these subject and objects.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.200
 According to teaching, it's already enlightened. Everything is enlightened.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.200
 Nothing to add, nothing to remove is all added.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:13.200
 Subject is enlightened, object is enlightened already, and that is what the teaching mentioned.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:20.200
 And why we don't see? Because of due to dualities. All those are known as obscurations.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.200
 That obscurations are not created by someone else and overloaded to us.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.200
 It is one's own creations, one's own troubles.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:36.570
 So therefore, to activate those, we are touching purity, quality of the nature, we are touching to

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.200
 the core of the true nature, where nature is.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:44.200
 All the Buddhas and Vedas are those who see everything in purity status.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:50.200
 We are going to really move to that status, to kind of be part of that.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:56.770
 In the Buddha teaching, open mention, mention that we all enlighten the state, really enlighten in

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.200
 reality level.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.200
 So therefore, kind of build up of confidence, courage, and commitment.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:09.280
 And kind of avoiding all the doubt and hesitation, intellectual attitude, particularly during this

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.200
 involvement time.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:16.200
 Intellectuals and all those are so important on the money-related level.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:21.420
 When we receive the involvement, when we receive the practice, the meditation, we start lingering

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.200
 with the intellectuals.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:30.200
 The doubt and hesitation, they are obstacles, is handed, is prevented, our guru, our realization.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:37.200
 And the same time is prevented to take the deep root in our heart of the practices.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.200
 They're not going to lead anything.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:45.120
 We've been having doubt and hesitation and skeptical thoughts for a long time, from the sense of

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.200
 beginning time.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.200
 But that really, really brought in a big result to us.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:55.690
 Because this result means they didn't, they didn't bought us joy and peace, happiness, something

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:57.200
 that we feel perfectly confident in.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:07.200
 Because of due to the ego activities of these all-skeptical hell and intellectual thoughts.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.200
 I'm not saying intellectual thoughts are bad, they are really in Buddhism.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.730
 Intellectual is very important to analyze all the gracious teacher Buddha, Gita, Chiki, study and

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:18.200
 contemplation.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:22.200
 Study and contemplation is part of the intellectual.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:29.250
 But there is a time to be intellectual, but there is time to be observing that to the heart and to

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:31.200
 grow and develop that.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.200
 We start thinking all the time, intellectual is hovering on the brains.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.200
 It's not just thinking to the heart.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:43.200
 It's then just become the essence. Because a person, even with so many teachings, so many downloads

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.200
, even you know it's not.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:50.580
 It's just only in the teaching, say that something, somebody knows it, something kind of like about

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.200
 the treasures of the rich person.

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:58.200
 But that don't help to our knowing the pressure or richness of the rich person.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:02.200
 That won't help us to feel our need.

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:07.200
 Our need is to practice, to observe the teaching to the heart.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.200
 That is what is important.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:16.200
 So therefore, with all those visual motivations, and then we go to the introduction.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.200
 The introduction is again, I told a little bit about the Vedya Sattva.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:24.200
 Of course, you all know, today we are receiving the involvement of the Vedya Sattva.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:27.200
 So I told Vedya Sattva, a little bit about the Vedya Sattva.

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.200
 And then I heard this teaching come from.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:34.200
 Again, even though we all know where this teaching comes from.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.200
 But this is a part of the lineage teaching.

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:41.200
 We will always be grateful to those all lineage masters.

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:49.200
 Teachers who bought this teaching until now, who kept that teaching so that we can connect it.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:54.200
 Therefore, how this teaching came.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:59.200
 And then, here is the meaning of the empowerment.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.200
 Meaning of the empowerment.

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.200
 And so those are two subdivisions.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:09.200
 And I now go with the first is the Vedya Sattva.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:14.200
 Vedya Sattva is of course the teaching of the greatest teacher, Buddha Kshatri Muni.

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.200
 Buddha Kshatri Muni appeared in many different forms.

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:21.200
 And he gave the different teachings of the inner tender teachings or the outer tender teachings.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:50.200
 So this time, this Vedya Sattva teaching is given by the Buddha Kshatri Muni.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:56.200
 Buddha Kshatri Muni, in the form of the Buddha Vedya Sattva, gave the teachings.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:59.200
 So now, who is Buddha Vedya Sattva?

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:04.200
 Buddha Vedya Sattva, a college teaching is one to be enlightened.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:09.200
 Once upon a time, Buddha Vedya Sattva is also as regular persons.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:16.200
 But because of the courage and commitment and presuming to practice meditation.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:21.200
 And then, Buddha Vedya Sattva become as known as Vedya Sattva.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:30.200
 Particularly, Vedya Sattva is so powerful and so powerful and direct to remove the obscurities,

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:32.200
 the negativities of the sentient beings.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:37.200
 Because that was his commitment in the teaching management.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.200
 During the process of his enlightenment,

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:46.200
 he particularly specialized to remove the obscurities,

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:49.200
 the negativities of the sentient beings,

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:55.200
 to remove and to bring a clear understanding of the nature as it is.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.200
 So that is really Vedya Sattva.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:00.200
 And Vedya Sattva is a very special Buddha.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:03.200
 Actually, also in the teaching of the optimal management,

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:07.200
 Vedya Sattva is the embodiment of all Buddhas.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:11.200
 In the embodiment of all five Dayana Buddhas.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:19.200
 If we spread out Vedya Sattva, then one thousand Buddhas.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.200
 And one hundred Buddhas.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:27.200
 And one hundred Buddhas then come to the one twenty-five Buddhas.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:32.200
 And the twenty-five Buddhas come to the five Buddhas, five Buddhas family.

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:37.200
 Five Buddhas family come to the one central street as Vedya Sattva.

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:44.200
 Often mentioned, Vedya Sattva is who embodies all Buddhas families.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:48.200
 And now what we will be thinking, what really that means?

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.200
 What that means? How that comes?

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:54.200
 According to the teaching, the Buddha Vedya Sattva,

00:10:54.200 --> 00:11:00.200
 generally the nature of the Buddhas wisdom, or our nature too.

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:04.200
 But Buddha's wisdom has all the five qualities.

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:07.200
 And five wisdom, five qualities.

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:14.200
 These five qualities of the wisdom appeared as five Dayana Buddhas.

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:19.200
 Those are, many of you will know, five Dayana Buddhas.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:25.200
 And those are the Verojanas, Amitavas, Vedya Sattvas,

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:33.200
 and some of us, and Amogas. Those are the five wisdom appeared in the form of five Dayana Buddhas.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:38.200
 And now the Vedya Sattva is Vedya family.

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:43.200
 It's a covenant teaching, it's a heart of the Buddhas, Vedya family.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.200
 It represents heart.

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:51.200
 And each of those five Buddha family also has five.

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:55.200
 Each of those Buddha families for example,

00:11:55.200 --> 00:12:03.200
 for example, Vedya Sattva is the like of the Verojana Buddhas.

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:11.200
 Verojana Buddhas has all the five Verojanas.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:17.200
 Five Verojanas are Darmadatta Verojanas, discrimination everness of Verojanas.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:24.200
 Then Verojanas, equanimity of Verojanas, all accomplishing Verojanas.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:32.200
 These one wisdom has encompassed all five.

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:36.200
 That each of those has also five.

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.200
 Each of those has five.

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:41.200
 These numbers are displays of the enlightenment.

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:49.930
 Enlightenment activity has no border, no restrictions, nor any times or time and space restrictions

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:50.200
.

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:52.200
 It's pervasive.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:56.200
 Therefore, there is so many enlightenings too.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.200
 It's all emanated.

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:00.200
 And why is it emanated?

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:04.200
 According to the teaching, what is the benefit for all living beings?

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.200
 According to their needs.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:12.200
 How many sentient beings here? In the according to the teaching, there are no numbers.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:16.200
 How many beings? No numbers. Numberless.

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:25.200
 As far as space goes, that power of sentient beings or the beings are existing.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:32.200
 As long as the beings are existing that much, everyone has negative emotions.

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.200
 They have obscurations.

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:36.200
 They struggle.

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:42.200
 As soon as we have the negative emotions, we are not scared.

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:45.200
 Everyone deep down has feelings.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:49.200
 They like to be scared, happy, in joy, in all that.

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:52.200
 The reality level is emotions.

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.200
 It's the grasp or the bosom.

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:57.200
 It's not making stable eyes.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.200
 It's struggle.

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:05.200
 If there is any benefit for all those beings, then Buddha emanated so many emanations.

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:08.200
 So many already benefited beings.

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:15.200
 But the reality level, all these beings have the same nature as Buddha.

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:20.200
 Whether it's thought of us or Buddha Shakyamuni.

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:23.200
 That means we all have the same nature.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:27.200
 Same nature, there is no difference according to the teaching.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.200
 We all have the same nature.

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:37.200
 But yet, our nature of that glowing wisdom, enlightenment,

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:46.200
 is covered by the obscurations, dualities, that which is created by one's own self.

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.200
 And then we struggle all the time.

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:52.200
 Deep down we want happy in the joy.

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:56.200
 But yet, in a way, we are already spoiling.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:15:02.200
 Because due to the duality of the ignorance, we don't exactly have to do that.

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:05.200
 So that's how many Buddhas emanate.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:09.200
 And Buddha is a very many different forms.

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:15.200
 Dharma Gaya Buddha, Sambo Gaya Buddha, and Dharma Gaya Buddha,

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:18.200
 and the numerous emanations.

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:22.200
 Also, I call it teaching, all that. In the Dharma Gaya level,

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:27.200
 Buddha Vaidya Sattva is no different than the Buddha Vaidya Sattva.

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:30.200
 Sorry, Buddha Samadva.

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:35.200
 You call it Buddha Samadva and Buddha Vaidya Sattva are the same.

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.200
 In the Dharma Gaya level.

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:39.200
 Dharma Gaya Buddha, yeah, that's it.

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:44.200
 In the Sambo Gaya level, then Buddha Vaidya Sattva.

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:46.200
 All Buddha Vaidya Dharas.

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:51.200
 And the Buddha Vaidya Dharas is often also referred as Dharma Gaya Buddhas.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:56.200
 According to the Yuma teachings on the school, or Yuma teachings,

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:59.200
 they divided the Dharma Gaya into three.

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:04.200
 Dharma Gaya of the Dharma Gaya, Dharma Gaya of the Sambo Gaya,

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:07.200
 and Dharma Gaya of the Nama Gaya.

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.200
 In that way, Buddhism.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:13.200
 Dharma Gaya of the Dharma Gaya Buddha is Buddha Samadha Buddhas.

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:18.200
 Dharma Gaya of the Sambo Gaya Buddha is Buddha Vaidya Dharas.

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:23.200
 And Dharma Gaya of the Nama Gaya Buddha is Buddha Vaidya Sattva.

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:27.200
 So, it is Dharma Gaya Buddha and Sambo Gaya Buddha.

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:32.200
 And then the Vaidya Sattva is appeared also in the Sambo Gaya of the Nama Gaya Buddhas.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:36.200
 Buddha of the Murali Muslims often in the East.

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:40.200
 It's directly, we count as directions.

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.200
 And so that is Sambo Gaya Buddha.

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:48.200
 In this case, Nama Gaya Buddhas are emulated and Vaidya Sattva is emulated.

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:52.200
 There are so many emanations of Vaidya Sattva.

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:54.200
 And those are such as.

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:57.200
 Vaidya Pani is known as the Vaidya.

00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:01.200
 Even though Vaidya Pani is totally in like wings,

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:06.200
 but he actually acts as the Murali Sattva or as the Buddha in the outer temples.

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:12.200
 Vaidya Pani is also known as the outer temples.

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:16.200
 Vaidya Pani is also known as the outer temples.

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:21.200
 Vaidya Vida Dharas is also known as the outer temples.

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:25.200
 Vaidya Pani is also known as the outer temples.

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:29.200
 Vaidya Vida Dharas is also known as the outer temples.

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:32.200
 Vaidya Pani is also known as the outer temples.

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:35.200
 Vaidya Pani is also known as the outer temples.

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:38.200
 More than 600 years ago,

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:42.200
 he gave variety of teachings as we heard and we know.

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:46.200
 There are all those teachings that mostly exist.

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:49.200
 Also, the teachings are known as dance.

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:53.200
 All the teachings of the three Bhaskar teachings.

00:17:53.200 --> 00:18:01.200
 Vinaya teaching, Sattva teaching, Abhidharma teaching, as we all know.

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:06.200
 Those teachings are divided into the yana level, the weaker level.

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:08.200
 The weaker level means the education level.

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:12.200
 Those are known as three yanas or nine yanas.

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:14.200
 It depends on the different categories.

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:18.200
 There is a number of them, but nine yanas are both teachings.

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:25.200
 Buddha gave the teachings of these, according to the weaker yana level.

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:30.200
 Then, the Buddha gave the teachings on the Vaidya Sattva, Sattva, in the Vedas.

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:36.200
 Mahayoga, Anu-Yoga, and as well as Atayoga teaching.

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:38.200
 There are a lot of teachings about that.

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:43.200
 As well as the Buddha, Vaidya Sattva, Vaidya Sattva teaching,

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:47.200
 outer temples, such as the Gurya temples, upper temples, lower temples,

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:50.200
 there are many emanations of the Vaidya Sattva.

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:52.200
 This is the Vaidya Sattva.

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:54.200
 This is the great Vaidya Sattva

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.200
 and the great Buddha.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:19:02.200
 Buddha means full of love, full of kindness, full of compassion, full of wisdom.

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:06.200
 That embodiment of Vaidya in the form of the Vaidya Sattva,

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:13.200
 particularly to purify the negativities, obscurations, samayas broken,

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:17.200
 and vows broken, and the commitment to brokenness.

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:22.200
 We feel we are falling apart and don't know the earth.

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:26.200
 I can't explain that up from the ground, the principle, our followers.

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:29.200
 Really, we have many times to feel those things.

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:33.200
 Vaidya Vaidya Sattva is the most powerful practice to clear the way,

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:38.200
 to purify all the obscurations, the negativities, misdeeds.

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:43.200
 Those misdeeds in the teaching often say happen sometimes with intentionally,

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:47.200
 sometimes with unintentionally, sometimes not knowingly,

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:53.200
 sometimes they happen due to the power of the negative emotions in heaven.

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.200
 But when it happens, the negative is negative.

00:19:56.200 --> 00:20:00.200
 Whichever way happens, it affects us, it affects others.

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:04.200
 To clear away that obscurations, particularly kind of standing,

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:07.200
 those contamination qualities,

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:11.200
 clear away that and at the same time it will not become contaminated

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:16.200
 and obscured long rooms for our practice in meditation.

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:20.200
 Therefore, Vaidya Sattva practices so far for that reason,

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:23.200
 the gracious teacher, Vaidya Sattva,

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:27.200
 will give those all teachings so many times, again and again.

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:29.200
 So Vaidya gives teaching.

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:32.200
 And then this teaching, of course, came to Tibet

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:34.200
 in the time of the Gurup and Masamu,

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:37.200
 and the great Master Shandar Rakita,

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:40.200
 and Kain Satsang Devini, as we all know.

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:45.200
 At that time, the whole body of the teaching is born to Tibet.

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:46.200
 Born to Tibet.

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:49.200
 That means that on the spiritual level,

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.200
 or in the book or text level,

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:54.200
 the whole body of the teaching is born,

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:56.200
 but not just on the text and the books,

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:59.200
 that they practiced meditating.

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:03.200
 They got the realizations within that lifetime.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:06.200
 They witnessed by the power of meditation,

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:11.200
 the practice of dharma, which came in a way newly in Tibet.

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:15.200
 They are so intelligent.

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:18.200
 Their devotion, their courage, their commitment.

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:20.200
 They are eager to learn, to practice,

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:24.200
 and follow the exact instructions of great Master Shandar Rakita,

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:27.200
 Vaidya Sattva, Masamu and Shandar Rakita.

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:29.200
 In other words, in Master Shandar Rakita,

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:32.200
 really they practice, they actualize.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:36.200
 Relation to boom, one after another.

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:41.200
 Master Shandar Rakita, one after another. 25 decibels.

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:43.200
 That all happened in that time.

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:47.200
 That century, it's not that throughout the century.

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:48.200
 And not just that.

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:49.200
 More than that.

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:52.200
 In the Mahasadat and the Yerba regions.

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:56.200
 And as well as the 35 kapas,

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:59.200
 lay practices of the Yandong regions.

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:01.200
 Those are listed.

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:02.200
 Really, all of that.

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:08.200
 So Tibet, mountain and valleys and land are filled with dharma,

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:11.200
 the teachings, the scripture in book poems,

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:13.200
 as well as a realization poem.

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:15.200
 That is in Buddha teaching.

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:17.200
 Buddha teaching is true.

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:20.200
 Spiritual and the realization.

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:23.200
 Spiritual, we expect, we study and contemplate.

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:26.200
 That is scripture level.

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:28.200
 But when you study and contemplate,

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:33.200
 the result is the practice. That is the meditation practice.

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:38.200
 But that true, uphill, upward teaching of the Buddha,

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:42.200
 which is best absolutely on love, kindness, compassion,

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:45.200
 nonviolence, respect and appreciation,

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:49.200
 to all living with, without any discrimination.

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:51.200
 That we know.

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:56.200
 Although, it is something truly connected with our heart.

00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:58.200
 Truly a treasure of our heart.

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:00.200
 We all love our kingdom,

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:05.200
 whether we have the belief or not belief.

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:07.200
 We love, everyone loves peace.

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:09.200
 Everyone loves happy.

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:11.200
 Every love you come.

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:12.200
 Triculated.

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:14.200
 Appreciation grateful.

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:17.200
 Everyone loves.

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:18.200
 That is dharma.

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:22.200
 Dharma is really teaching that.

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:26.200
 Whether we have the practice, we can be able to keep that out or not.

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:27.200
 That is different.

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:30.200
 The true nature of dharma, that's it.

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:38.200
 And so, it becomes so, so established and saturated in heart and mind.

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:41.200
 All the great practices in that thing.

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:44.200
 And the Gurbi Masambhava particularly gives so many teachings,

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:47.200
 of the very inner teachings, the inner thought of teachings.

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:50.200
 And also, those teachings are there.

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:52.200
 The continuity, as I mentioned.

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:54.200
 You all know.

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:57.200
 And these three lineages in the Nyingma particularly.

00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:02.200
 Gama and dharma, and pure visual lineage.

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:07.200
 Those three lineages are gama, and dharma, and visual lineage.

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:12.200
 Each of those has three principal lineage of the Nyingma schools, what they call.

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:15.200
 Mind-to-mind transmission lineage,

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.200
 and Samoanic transmission lineage,

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:19.200
 and oral transmission lineage.

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:23.200
 Those all contains, these three lineages,

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:26.200
 contain within the lineage of the Gama,

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:28.200
 within the lineage of dharma,

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:32.200
 within the lineage of the pure visual lineage.

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:35.200
 And among that lineage teaching,

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:38.200
 particularly this teaching, is dharma teachings.

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:42.200
 Dharma teaching is then, again, so many great thetans came.

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:45.200
 Those are the emanations of those 25 disciples,

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:48.200
 as well as the 80 masters of the Yeba region,

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:54.200
 and 35 of the makwas of the Yandong area regions.

00:24:54.200 --> 00:25:01.200
 And so, there's so many those.

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:05.200
 So many, those are great masters.

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:09.200
 As earlier, we were providing work in Sambama,

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:12.200
 and then they emanated so many thetans,

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:14.200
 so many masters, scholars.

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:18.200
 And so many also really who benefit all the other beings,

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:21.200
 and it may be not necessarily in the form of the teacher

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:24.200
 and all that, but benefit and help and support.

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:26.200
 So many problems came.

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:29.200
 Among that, this is, this teaching is then,

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:33.200
 teaching is discovered by great thetans,

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:37.200
 known as Thaksa Numba, many of you know, many of you heard,

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.200
 know the language of Thaksa Numba.

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:43.200
 And Thaksa Numba is a renowned reincarnation

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:46.200
 of the Sanghi Yishi.

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:51.200
 Nubchi Sanghi Yishi Rambochis, say.

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:53.200
 Nubchi Sanghi Rambochis.

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:57.200
 Nubchi Sanghi Yishi is the one of the 25 disciples

00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:00.200
 of the Murpema Sambama,

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:03.200
 and Shandarachida, and Mamaramatara,

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:08.200
 but also, he was also known as nine heart-like students

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:12.200
 of the Murpema Sambama, nine.

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:14.200
 The Murpema Sambama first time,

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:18.200
 when he gave the empowerment on the Sami Mokin in the cave,

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:20.200
 according to the teaching,

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:23.200
 he gave the empowerment of the head hirukas

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:28.200
 in the Sami Chibu cave for nine students.

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:32.200
 Among that, Sanghi Yishi Rambochis,

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:35.200
 one of them, that student,

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:37.200
 and that included for the Yishinshoja,

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:40.200
 as well as the Kinkesom District,

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:43.200
 so called the nine students.

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:47.200
 So Sanghi Yishi was one of the nine students,

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:50.200
 heart-like students,

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:54.200
 also sometimes called nine vide daras of Tibet.

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:58.200
 At vide dara of the Indian,

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:01.200
 nine at vide daras of the Tibet.

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:03.200
 They are called Harula.

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:06.200
 Sanghi Yishi is the vide dara of the Tibetan,

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:10.200
 a whole nine heart-like student of the Murpema Sambama.

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:13.200
 And Sanghi Yishi is not just only that,

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:16.200
 but he was one of the principal,

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:20.200
 lineage hall of the Nyingma Kama teachings.

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:21.200
 Kama teachings.

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:27.200
 And they were also the founder of the Anu-Yova teachings,

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:29.200
 three Anathandhar teachings,

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:33.200
 Maha-Yova, Anu-Yova, Akhi-Yova teachings,

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:36.200
 and Anu-Yova teachings, who both fit with.

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:41.200
 Of course, the Murpema Sambama and the Shandari Devi,

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:44.200
 but specifically Anu-Yova and her,

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:47.200
 all body of Anu-Yova and her,

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:51.200
 he, Sanghi Yishi, wanted to be.

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:54.200
 Sanghi Yishi was very courageous also,

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:58.200
 courageous, determination, and courage.

00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:01.200
 Around '87, when he was young,

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:05.200
 he always had a willing and a wish to go Indian,

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:07.200
 India and other countries.

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:11.200
 So, because of his courage and commitment that told,

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:13.200
 then he went to India and,

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:15.200
 or Oriana,

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:18.200
 and now modern times they even called Hunza.

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:20.200
 Hunza, I think it's in Pakistan, now Hunza.

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:22.200
 Those areas, you know,

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:25.200
 all targeted seven times and some crystals.

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:26.200
 He really went.

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:28.200
 But during that time,

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:33.200
 he received so many great teachings from all the Buddha teachings,

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.200
 particularly the Anu-Yova teachings,

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:39.200
 and it is a tantra that he brought back to Tibet.

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:42.200
 So, the Anu,

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:44.200
 so among the three inner tantra,

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:49.200
 the Anu-Yova tantra is really established or brought by,

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:52.200
 back to Tibet by Sanghi Yishi.

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:55.200
 And Sanghi Yishi was then also, as I said,

00:28:55.200 --> 00:29:00.200
 this very powerful, important lineage holder of Tibet,

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:03.200
 of the lineage holder of the Kama teachings.

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:04.200
 Kama teachings.

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:06.200
 So, he emanated so many tantra,

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:09.200
 one after another, many great tantra,

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:10.200
 one after another,

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:15.200
 and the Thasunu Baba, one of the renowned tantra emanation

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:19.200
 and the tantra of the Sanghi Yishi.

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:22.200
 And Sanghi, his emanation also in the teachings,

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:25.200
 said that, such as the great master Mohan Mukher,

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:28.200
 the great scholar,

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:31.200
 he was also emanation of the Sanghi Yishis.

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:33.200
 When Guru Pemma Sambabgid,

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:35.200
 at the Mahatma Haruka teachings,

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:38.200
 Sanghi Yishi's empowerment,

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:40.200
 or when he threw the flowers to the mandala,

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:41.200
 which is connected,

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:43.200
 which is to identify which is,

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:45.200
 because they are connected, it is.

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:51.200
 And the Sanghi Yishi,

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:57.200
 and the plover, held down on the mandala

00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:59.200
 of the southern direction.

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:02.200
 And that is the mandala of the Yamitatas.

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:05.200
 So Yamitata is his personal,

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:08.200
 Manjukiri has become his personal deity practices,

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:12.200
 and he actualized realization through Yamitata practice.

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:15.200
 So therefore, Sanghi Yishi is renowned

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:19.200
 as very famous yogi, or the master,

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:24.200
 Vidyadhara of the Yamitaka practices,

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:27.200
 among the head head of the practice.

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:29.200
 And now these master emanated,

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:31.200
 so many as he said already,

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:33.200
 and the Thakshama Mohan was,

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:38.200
 came around, I think 16, end of 16.
