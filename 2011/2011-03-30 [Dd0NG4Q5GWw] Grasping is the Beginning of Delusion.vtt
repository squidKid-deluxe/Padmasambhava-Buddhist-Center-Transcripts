00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 A brilliant sky. In that sky, there is filled with it, as I use the example, as filled with anode

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.020
 of the wind.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:25.100
 The sky is filled with the anode of the wind. And one of the beginning of the wind is moving,

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.020
 moving, and first instant becomes that leg.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:42.300
 The object of the next instant moving of the energy of the wind. So then, that subtle object has

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:51.040
 subtle notion or of the grasping.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:01:05.330
 Or subtle thought of subtle object as very small grasping. And that is the starting point of the

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.060
 continuation of grasping.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:22.080
 This is very subtle. The first thing, again, this open mind is the building of the sky.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:32.830
 If we don't use the wind, look to our own mind. First, when you stay in the personal status, we don

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.080
't see any mind.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:43.080
 This is the dharmakaya mind, I think. There is every teacher's mind. And the way we stay there,

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.100
 there is subtle, there is thoughts coming.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.460
 So many of them, very subtle and gross, then thoughts begin to come. And that is the energy of this

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.100
 dharmakaya mind.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:01.880
 So this beginning time of that subtle energy moving, first becomes the object, the second becomes

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:10.120
 the subject, and there is, when you have that division, then that is grasping, thought comes.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:21.220
 Then grasping is we hold into that. We hold as subject and object. That is the grasping or clinging

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:27.140
, and that is the starting point of the delusions.

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:35.590
 So is it always the "I" that begins to see that there is something? Not necessarily the "I". "I" is

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:43.160
, "I grasping" is what we call, is not grasping the strong one, according to what I am teaching to.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:53.110
 But the gross clinging, clinging is really the subtle obstacle, and that is what you must have

00:02:53.110 --> 00:03:02.430
 heard. There are two egos, the self-ego clinging and the ego of knowledge or the ego of dharma, or

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.180
 the ego of dharma, the ego of the individual.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:24.450
 So this ego of dharma is the grasp. Ego of the clinging is this, ego of dharma is the subtle

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.200
 clinging.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:39.630
 I think I can. But again, this is subtle, very subtle. Okay, now, beginning of the grasping, begin

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.220
 of grasping is the beginning of the delusion.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:54.290
 That is the beginning of grasping, and that is so subtle. Very tiny, tiny in the teaching set. I

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.240
 mean, that is really subtle, very subtle.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:05.440
 And the way that teaching is explaining that happiness is then subtle, that energy, and that you

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:13.720
 are told the first one becomes something, object and setting become something, and we had let

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.260
 grasping in the sense of the grasping.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.060
 And then in the God of Zama, we were also teaching, saying that there is the namah shibah sahajam j

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:30.710
i, that means there is subtle panic also happens. Very small panic happens, and then through that j

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:40.280
en reaction, then all this delusion begins, and that is the beginning of the grasping.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:50.940
 So this grasping itself has no best, it is only the display of the mind, and therefore we can claim

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:59.100
, and therefore nature of the grasping, nature of dharmakaya, and nature of the wisdom, basically

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.300
 all the same.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:08.790
 There is no really difference. It is the grasping, it is just only one reaction of the mind, and

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.320
 then we hold it onto that.

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.320
 Is it possible to say a little example of that?

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:16.320
 What?

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:22.600
 Is it possible to say a little example of that? Like can you say from your own experience a little

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.320
 time when you can see that?

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:33.090
 Any examples? Any examples? I am trying to, what I say, the first and second, those are my kind of

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:33.340
 examples.

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:41.530
 Those are really my examples, but what I will say, a scientific way, if I can say, I should learn

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.340
 that with physics.

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:51.090
 But how, what the physical say, how this samsara, this, I am not samsara, how this all begins, how

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:56.360
 this all begins, really I am not going to kidding, what this is.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:02.360
 How that is because, before this old, this big one, how this way start?

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.360
 Matter and antimatter.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:12.600
 So that, where the antimatter and the matter start, I am not joking, where the matter of antimatter

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:18.380
 and antimatter, how that started, what they experience.

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:22.380
 This is the same way.

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:31.230
 All start from the emptiness, all start from the true nature, the openness, dharmadhatu, start from

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:33.400
 dharmadhatu, not really.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:39.400
 That is the example, so how, how, now I am going to say, ask physics, what this is.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:45.990
 But physics always goes to the limit that, I think that's it, because they are always trying to

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:47.400
 catch with mental status.

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:53.700
 Mental status, they all go further, they are always trying to, then they are, I mean, I am not, I

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:57.420
 can't say that, but then they are going wrong, wrong.

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:03.190
 But if you brag through that, then, then that's ready, that's it, that's it, they've got the money,

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:04.420
 money is simple.

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:09.780
 And what, now they are saying what's called, I heard this, it's called dark matter something, dark

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:15.420
 matter or the dark matter of the world or something, they are talking, those things.

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:19.420
 Black matter, black matter, dark matter, all that, that's it.

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:25.440
 So, this is what it is, and therefore, in the Buddha's teachings, the nature is the same.

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:33.270
 Outer, inner, and of course in the Buddha's teaching, all start from the mind, it's the start from

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:34.440
 the mind.

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:42.900
 But nature is the same, same. Therefore, it's expressed, there is nothing to go more further than

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:43.440
 that.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:47.460
 It's inconceivable, when you reach that level, that.

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:53.460
 But however inconceivable that is, then the energy is flowing, it's all that.

00:07:53.460 --> 00:08:02.560
 How that is working, all that, and then this Nagarjuna's teaching, for example, all the Madhavaka,

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:05.460
 all those Nagarjuna using the logic,

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:14.460
 reasoning to explore the Dhanakaya nature, and which is called Pandya Parhamata or Mademaka nature.

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:18.460
 Mademaka, which means what? It's the middle way.

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:23.460
 Nature is not extreme. It's in, always, balance it.

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:28.460
 Balance it in the middle. That middle means balance in the status.

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:35.460
 So this is what really the nature is. And that is the inexpressible.

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:41.460
 Yet, even though there is an inconceivable state, but everything is flowing, everything is system.

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:47.460
 Even if it is flowing, even the instant that, never lost the history of the origin of the college

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:49.460
 or the nature of the natural,

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:58.140
 never lost the natural colleges, therefore every concept, general concept in the world, is never

00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:01.460
 lost the origin of some other nature.

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:07.460
 But the teaching is all, therefore is enlightened state. Always that's what the teaching is.

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:12.460
 It's all is enlightened. Only we are mishandled.

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:21.460
 Our individual is mishandled and we grasp. Grasping is not natural. Clinging is not natural.

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:27.460
 Every clear way that, there's nothing you need to do anything.

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:33.460
 Everything is powerful. That's what it is.

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:35.460
 Okay. Thank you.
