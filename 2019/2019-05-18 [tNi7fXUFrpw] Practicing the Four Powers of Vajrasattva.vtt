00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.450
 "It is wonderful, it is beautiful, and I thank you all. Again we follow the teachings, again we

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.500
 follow the teachings of the great teacher,

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:21.500
 Mother Chagamuni, the holy teachings, and to do that again we learn as always the teachings said,

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:27.500
 and the teachings we heard from the great masters, one after another, they will always act worthy

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:35.930
 and arise in the race of the good motivations, great good motivations, and that motivation is your

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.500
 inefficiencies,

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:45.500
 and we should feel your inefficiencies. And then we go together, today we are going to reflect

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.500
 and study and contemplate the teaching of the great teacher, Mother Chagamuni,

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:58.500
 in order to benefit for all beings, to benefit myself, to benefit all beings,

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.500
 to purport the dural purpose that I am going to do. Then you have that intuitive thought,

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.500
 reach that strongly in the heart and mind. And then with that thought and brain also where you are

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:10.500
 not teaching,

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.500
 Mother Dzogchen teaching, the reality level is everything is enlightened state,

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.760
 everything is in three higher stages, even though we don't sit at this moment, but that is where

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:22.500
 things are.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.500
 So come and bring up that motivation and at least open our door for the motivation,

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:37.290
 toward the big wall, the reality of the basic goodness of where things are. And those all are known

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.500
 as motivations.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:45.500
 With those motivations, then again as we are talking this time, also as a foundation,

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.500
 and foundation of Dzogchen practices for renowned sessions.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:56.500
 And for renowned sessions, which is great teaching, as the teachings of the first two noble truths,

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:03.500
 which is the suffering truth, cause of suffering truth. When we know that and then we are

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.500
 practicing

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.500
 and going through Dzogchen teaching, that is part truth. We are following the part truth.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.500
 And the result, the achievement, whatever we get going through the practice of Dzogchen,

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:20.500
 those are known as SSA attitude, and the final realization is then the youthful wise body

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:27.800
 or reaching of the port vision, port vision, and that is the final kind of achievement of the

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.500
 journey of the part truth.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:37.500
 So with first is, again, this foundation. Fondration, or this "Porino Saka" thought,

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.500
 is the honor stones or the anchor of the practices, as in the teaching always, it must be said.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:52.590
 And devotion is, again, is the light of the practices. It might be light, it might be warm, it

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.500
 might be beautiful.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.500
 So that again, with the devotion of this "Porino Saka" thought,

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:04.500
 we were, one after another, really dead. And yesterday we discussed, there will be a border,

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:12.500
 the karma, karma and cause and effort of the inevitable. So, karma is inevitable,

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.150
 according to the teaching, unless we cleanse and purify that. Otherwise, we are going to really

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.500
 make sure

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:24.500
 it will work properly, whether it is good or whether it is bad, or whether it is mixture.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.500
 And good karma will bring good result, bad karma will bring bad result, and mixture of karma,

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:37.500
 that means mixture of good and bad, will mix your results, exactly as we plant the seed,

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:44.500
 and that will break that, exactly that, results. And then, among that fourth is, that bad karma,

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:50.500
 bad karma is negative with it. When there is negative with it, natural negative with it,

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:58.500
 we listed all those ten natural negative with it. And ten negative with it, and then plus,

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:05.500
 and then there is also known as the negative with it, that we can make by, by,

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:13.500
 what's called, carelessly, we can make mistakes, and those are taught by the Buddhas.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:19.500
 In the Vinaya teaching, in the Mayana teaching, in the Vinaya teaching, we make the mistakes.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.500
 Those are known as 'publicated mistakes', 'publicated mistakes'.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:31.970
 And those mistakes, when it happens, it is mistakes, then it makes, makes it obscurations, negative

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:32.500
 with it.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:38.500
 So now, when we are thinking of these obscurations, when that happens, the karma happens,

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:45.500
 it is, that's very important to cleanse and purify that. That is really the most important.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:50.500
 In every good karma, every did something good, you should acknowledge that,

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.500
 and feel happy and dedicated in everything. Even the smallest things,

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:01.500
 that we did something really good, feel happy, and wish that I can do more next time.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:07.500
 We always inspire yourself, always think for yourself, acknowledge yourself,

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:14.500
 that I did good things, to benefit myself, to all the things that in some degree I did this.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:20.500
 That's effervescent activities, and then immediately, we can do, purify that.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.500
 And that is so important in the teachings, it is cleansing and purifying.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:31.500
 In the great master, in his teaching, he said, the great master Atika, when he came,

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:38.500
 he said that, I never made any mistakes, because he didn't make any mistakes,

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:44.500
 as natural mistakes or naked videos. But when he came to those that were propagated,

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.500
 or the Buddha's teaching, or the rules and regulations, or vows,

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:52.500
 if you say vows, vows and samayas, then he said,

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.500
 in the Vinaya teaching, rules, in the Parthi Mokja rules,

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:00.500
 I didn't make any. It's always been quite good.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:07.500
 And when he came to the bodhisattva, vows, then it becomes very lingering.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:13.500
 And when he came to the vumahayaka very in a while, then it becomes really mixed up.

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.500
 But in the teaching he said, that the lifestyle said,

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:22.500
 ever that happened, immediately, great master Atika purifies.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:27.500
 Immediately, acknowledge and purify that. Clares with him.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.500
 And most days, in the teaching he said, if you do it purify,

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:36.500
 then it kind of build up, build up, become stronger and stronger, stronger.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:43.500
 And if you use the example, stain, it becomes more kind of stain, tarnish, more tarnish.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:51.500
 But immediately, we can soon, we can purify that, then it clean, clares with him.

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:57.500
 And the teaching often said, mistake or has no good qualities,

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:01.500
 but it has no good qualities, we can clean, purify.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:05.500
 Can we clean that? So cleaning is so important.

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:07.500
 Purify is so important.

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:13.500
 That's why in the Buddha's teaching, that according to Vinaya, according to Mahayana,

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:17.500
 in the Vedayana, there is always purificacy.

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:22.500
 And that purificacy systems in the Vinaya teaching, I think it's similar,

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:29.500
 similar with Christianity's, that those are, they go in the box, box and what?

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.500
 Box and box fashion.

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:35.500
 What? Confession. Confession.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:39.500
 Confession, box or confection chamber, go and confection that.

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:44.500
 In the Buddhism, in the Vedaya teaching, they don't go in the box or chamber particularly,

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:52.500
 but always you can purify, or compress, purify, really other Sangha friends,

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:56.500
 who has similar vows and similar morality,

00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:03.500
 who is observing and taking care of the keeper of the morality, you can purify that

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:08.500
 and mention that, and stay in front of those with the Buddha's stage of shrine,

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:16.500
 if not the shrine, in front of that, you explain what happened, what I did with this, I purify it.

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:21.500
 And there is kind of certain little bit, each of the box stations and do that,

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:27.500
 and then say that things, and then in the end, that other one will say,

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:32.500
 "Whoa, that was a skillful mitts, skillful mitts and snapping that."

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:35.500
 And then it's a clay, according to the teaching.

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:42.500
 In the Mahasatram, in the Mahayana teaching, then it teaches, again, it looks slightly different,

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:46.500
 doing this sattva, and that is, you can meditate, feel the presence of it,

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:52.500
 such as 35 Buddhas, the companions, three hips, many of them have that sattva,

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:58.500
 it's a very famous sattva, sattva to purification, purification, three hips,

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:05.500
 hip of the negativities, hip of the ball stations, hip of the dedication and aspirations.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:12.500
 With that, feel the presence of the Buddhas and bodhisattvas, and then purify that.

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:19.500
 In the Mahasatram, the Mahayana teaching, then there is mune, but among all that in the teaching,

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:22.500
 purify with various sattva practices.

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:27.500
 That is the most powerful and so effective and powerful,

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:31.500
 because in the teaching, it says, "Mahayana sattva, before we get enlightenment,

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:36.500
 we become Buddhahood," that was his commitment, or aspirations,

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:42.500
 that, "When I need to become enlightenment, or whoever has any negativity of spiritual,

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:49.500
 may I purify that. By hearing my name or practice on me, may I purify that."

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:56.610
 As he had that aspiration there, because Vedya sattva is the enlightenment, according to the

00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:57.500
 teachings,

00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:04.500
 so therefore, Vedya sattva practice is the most powerful and effective and great purification,

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:07.500
 that we all received that teaching.

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:12.500
 So therefore, really that is one of them.

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:19.500
 Great practice, and then that is, again, when you practice the Vedya sattva,

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:24.500
 in the teaching that we learned also in the teaching of mune practices, four powers.

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:28.500
 That is really the important, four powers.

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:34.500
 And those four powers, the power of the object, power of the uprooting,

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:41.500
 and power of restoring, and power of the unbeheld.

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:49.150
 Those four powers, in the teaching said, these four powers have used that technique to cleanse and

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:49.500
 purify,

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:54.500
 no matter whatever it is, it will clearse you, it will purify you.

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:59.500
 And the first power of the object is, we know, it is Vedya sattva.

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:02.500
 Vedya light, Vedya sattva.

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:09.500
 There is many different, also, Vedya sattva in front, above, and one's home side, Vedya light.

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:14.500
 But a hole in the purificary joint, Vedya light, Vedya sattva,

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:18.500
 above one's head, and facing the same directions.

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:25.500
 Same directions with Vedya light. Vedya sattva is embodiment of all the Buddhas,

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:29.500
 of three times and ten directions.

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:32.500
 We all know that Vedya sattva, that.

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:37.500
 And Vedya sattva is also the principle of the Lord of the Mandanas.

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:46.500
 In the teaching said, one hundred Buddhas can summarize into five Buddhas, or ten Buddhas.

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:50.500
 But ten Buddhas can summarize into one Buddhas.

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:52.500
 That is Vedya sattva.

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:57.500
 Vedya sattva is the source of all the display of the according of the Buddha.

00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:02.500
 Everyone, therefore, he said, the medha, the principle of deity,

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:06.500
 or the Lord of all the Buddhas of Heavens.

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:10.500
 And Vedya sattva is also so powerful, so important.

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:15.500
 Therefore, every Vedya in the teaching has Vedya sattva practices.

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:20.500
 Out of Tantra, in a Tantra, every time we need practices,

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:23.500
 there is always Vedya sattva practices, too.

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:26.500
 So that is the meaning of other Vedya sattva.

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:34.500
 And so, so, embodiment of all the Buddhas have strong devotions.

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:42.500
 And in the teaching said, power of the object has the outer power of object, inner power of object.

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:47.500
 Power of object, outer power of object is the Vedya sattva.

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.500
 We visualize on that.

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:53.500
 Our above all head, transcendent, versus the brand of body,

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:55.500
 with concern or without concern.

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:57.500
 Which even that is.

00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:01.500
 Many times, in a Tantra, it is with concern.

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:04.500
 So, visualize that.

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:09.500
 And the power of inner, inner power is our devotions.

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:15.500
 Our devotion, our bodhicata, our determinations.

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:21.500
 That is really, that we have strong, strong devotions.

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:24.500
 And also strong bodhicata.

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:28.500
 We are practicing of the Jedding and the Mahayana practice, the Vedya and the practice.

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:30.500
 It is not just only for us.

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:41.750
 Every practice, that is to benefit all beings, or to benefit one's own self, and to others, your

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:42.500
 purposes.

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:44.500
 That is the, that.

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:48.500
 So therefore, also have strong bodhicata.

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:56.500
 And the devotions, and the determinations, I am going to clarify this.

00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:02.500
 So those are the teachings here. Power, inner power, object of inner body.

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:05.500
 Now combine that two, toghede.

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:10.500
 Toghede, we are going to cleanse it, and put it through.

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:13.500
 And so with that, that is power of the object.

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:21.500
 Second power of the object is, sorry, second power is, power of the uprooting.

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:25.500
 Uprooting. What we are going to uproot?

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:32.500
 Uprooting the negativity, that obscurations, that we are going to uproot.

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:36.500
 And how many negativities, generally, according to the teaching said,

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:42.500
 how many obscurations? We have two obscurations.

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:46.500
 Emotional obscurations, knowledge obscurations.

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:53.500
 And then furthermore, we have divided, or opening in teaching said, four obscurations.

00:14:53.500 --> 00:15:02.500
 Garment obscurations, emotional obscurations, and knowledge obscurations, habit obscurations.

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:10.500
 So emotional obscurations is divided in one more, which is garment obscurations.

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:16.500
 Particularly this time, we are focused to purify the garment obscurations.

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:18.500
 Garment obscurations.

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:22.500
 Well, actually we did that, we did negative, negative.

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:26.500
 We are going to purify. And then that becomes the stain of the knot,

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:29.500
 caused by the emotional obscurations.

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:32.500
 Of course, it's all effort, it's all effort.

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:35.500
 But we are going to purify the garment obscurations.

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:37.500
 Garment obscurations.

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:44.500
 In the teaching said, if we tend to that, highlight that garment.

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:46.500
 Whatever we did, highlight that.

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:48.500
 Highlight of the time.

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:52.500
 Highlight by the physical thing.

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:56.500
 And that garment is written by the principle, act by physical,

00:15:56.500 --> 00:16:00.500
 or by verbally, by mentally. Mentally.

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:05.500
 And activated that also highlighted to whom we targeted that.

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:08.500
 What did they have preferred?

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:11.500
 You can highlight that.

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:14.500
 And we highlighted that in the teaching said,

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:17.500
 that really meant so begin to uproot.

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:22.500
 We are using the powerful detergent, detergent to clear away that.

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:26.500
 So highlight that. Highlight it.

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:33.500
 Time, time level like this is like month, day, or month, year, month, day.

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:36.500
 And even hours, we can highlight that.

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:38.500
 Wouldn't that happen?

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:40.500
 We are sincerely that.

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.500
 And then if we didn't remember that things.

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:46.500
 And then just said, all that I don't remember in the past lives,

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:50.500
 whatever I did mistakes, whatever that hurt, we needed that.

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:53.500
 That really can strongly highlight that.

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:55.500
 And we have that, that.

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:59.500
 And also same time, acknowledge that.

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:03.500
 That means acknowledge mistake is a mistake.

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:07.500
 Kind of feel, I did one whole something.

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:09.500
 Acknowledge it to yourself.

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:12.500
 It's not something that you have to tell through that.

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:15.500
 I did something mistakes, and I'm going to clear away that.

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:17.500
 Clear away that. Acknowledge that.

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:20.500
 And they have a highlight of time,

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:24.500
 and both physically, verbally, mentally, to whom,

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:28.500
 and what will be performed, all that you highlight.

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:30.500
 Highlight.

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:34.500
 That is known as the power of the uprooting.

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:37.500
 Power of the uprooting.

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:40.500
 And the power of the restoring.

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:43.500
 Now to claim it.

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:45.500
 Claim it, that.

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:48.500
 That nature of the power of the restoring is,

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:50.500
 in the teachings said that, what is?

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:56.500
 That you have the determination that I'm not going to repeat that again.

00:17:56.500 --> 00:18:01.500
 Have some duty of the confirmation of conventions in our heart and mind

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:03.500
 that I'm not going to repeat that.

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:06.500
 By the blessings of the Buddha, and the Dharma, and the Sangha,

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:08.500
 Guru Mooji, and everyone in Vayasatham,

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:11.500
 I may, I never repeat that again.

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:13.500
 And I'm not going to do it.

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:17.500
 Have that kind of determination, conviction is power.

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:22.500
 And it will clearly, it will restore, it will restore.

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:27.500
 With that, then use the power of the undidot.

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:31.500
 Undidot is then practiced with yourselves.

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:35.500
 Practice, so with all that thought, and power of the undidot,

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:38.500
 and joining the mantra, exactly where you like it,

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:41.500
 according to teaching that I'm you, you learn,

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:43.500
 what you're according to teaching in the mud,

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:48.500
 and the bhagalaya, and receiving all the nakras, healing nakras,

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:52.500
 purification nakras, cleve, all the obscurations,

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:56.500
 mistakes, the mistakes, whatever that thing for,

00:18:56.500 --> 00:19:02.500
 or that was intentionally, unintentionally, anything that we did,

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:05.500
 did anything, or even past lives, whatever that,

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:09.500
 now it's cleansing purifying, and everything said that,

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:13.500
 all this went to-do, negativity kind of came,

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:17.500
 according to your practice, it clears everything purify.

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:21.500
 And all went, and that came, and then also that transformed,

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:25.500
 kind of all, it also gives you all those kind of dead honors,

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:27.500
 all those who are expecting something from you,

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:30.500
 they got that and everything was satisfied,

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.500
 happy in the joy of them.

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:37.500
 Any kind, that way, the sattva mantra, the 100 syllable mantra,

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:41.500
 at least 21 times, or 7 times, 21 times,

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:45.500
 and then of course, when the practice is over 100,000 is that,

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:48.500
 that of course, whenever you did this,

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:51.500
 but do the practices, and then that,

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:54.500
 and then at the end, and the various sattva,

00:19:54.500 --> 00:20:00.500
 and our joy, and our children, or our son,

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:02.500
 and our daughter, now you're completed,

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:06.500
 purify your obscurations delightfully with smiling,

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:09.500
 and melted various sattva, and merge to yourself,

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:13.500
 or dissolve to yourself, and then,

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:17.500
 then, again, with the visualization of the various sattva,

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:21.500
 or just one various sattva, and then all various sattva,

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:23.500
 and the entire universe is transformed,

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:26.500
 the mandala, or the purland of various sattva,

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:28.500
 everyone is tiring various sattva,

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:31.500
 all the songs are the various sattva mantra,

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:33.500
 all forms of the various sattva,

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:38.830
 All the conservators are the vast space of the Dharma guy, serious, and he joined the Vaija Sato

00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:43.500
 mantra, continually short mantra. That is what the teaching said.

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:50.480
 All you can visualize, the entire universe has become the medalla of the five Vaija Sato feminists,

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:53.500
 white Vaija Sato, who ever is covered.

00:20:53.500 --> 00:21:00.060
 All of them have said white Vaija Sato, yellow Vaija Sato, red Vaija Sato, blue Vaija Sato, and

00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:04.500
 green Vaija Sato. Entirely the universe is transformed in that nature state.

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:11.500
 Everyone tried the same thing, and the Atrayu or the resounded mantra of the Vaija Sato.

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:18.470
 So those are known as the practice of purification. When you purify that, and then all the negative

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:19.500
 is purified.

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:26.500
 Negative is well purified, as much as you practice it. So it really restores.

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:31.500
 And that's why in the Vaijaana teaching also, every time there is called 'sopjung', 'mata sopjung'

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:38.500
 is called 'restory purification', 'restory of the samayas' every 15 days.

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:43.990
 They do in Vinaya teaching group, they talk about it, they do that ceremony, and Vaijaana teaching,

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:46.500
 there's particularly ceremony sadhana.

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:51.500
 They do these sopjung practices, restoring the samaya practices.

00:21:51.500 --> 00:22:05.220
 And for example, for us, like this, our 10th vaija and 20th vaija is also restored sopjung too,

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:07.500
 because we make offerings, such as offering, and then do the Vaija Sato practice of our goal name,

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:07.500
 Sten's King.

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:14.500
 We join in the practice, it's no time, but we make offerings, we make offerings of the 'hamadana',

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:19.250
 we make offerings of the 'rabda', we make offerings of the 'thoma', we make offerings of the 'light

00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:22.500
', and those are very important offerings.

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:35.440
 And also in a very special samva life, according to Vaijaana teaching, it's very big offering, with

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:40.180
 that offering, and then we make the Vaija, Sten's King, that purification practice, which is also

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:41.500
 restoring, and then also the 'sarnoni' of 'varungki', or the 'sindhoja' practice, which is special.

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:48.870
 Again, our conversation practices that. So, those are, these are so, so beautiful and so important

00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:49.500
 things.

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:56.660
 So, those are generally, again, to maintain our, our kind of restore our, our obscurations, or

00:22:56.660 --> 00:23:01.500
 remove the obscurations, and restart our, our realizations.

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:05.500
 And then it's not just, we purify the negative, we kind of only purify that.

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:11.580
 When we do that, what we accommodate the merit, merit, accommodate the merit, what's the merit? It

00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:16.500
's all really fulfilling, so therefore, what is going out is the obscurations.

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:22.500
 What is gaining is merit, merit. When you gain the merit, that means realization is coming.

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:28.740
 What is the realization? Is that realization of loving kindness, conviction, versus all that is

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:36.380
 really growing, shining, so that is what, you know, practice, this purification is promoting each

00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:38.500
 time that we can do that.

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:51.040
 And then, so that's, that's just, again, part of this poor, poor and no second thought. That's the

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:53.500
 karma, we're talking about the karma today.

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:59.990
 And as I said, there is good karma. If anything activity that we can really always rejoice and

00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:04.500
 happy, acknowledge, and always inspire ourself, ourself.

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:14.820
 Feel happy, acknowledge, we know the pride of arrogance, but aspire and always kind of put it, try

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:23.500
 to put the high levels, always kind of advance the level of the capabilities, always with that.

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:30.500
 I mean, putting, putting that, that, that is what in the teaching said, and we're all so important.

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:35.500
 So now, with those understanding, we again, we go to the top.
