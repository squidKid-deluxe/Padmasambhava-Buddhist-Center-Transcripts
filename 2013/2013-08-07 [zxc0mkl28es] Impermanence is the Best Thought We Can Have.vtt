00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.880
 The Buddha's teaching often said, for example, this world, where we are, is the world. There are so

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.520
 many diversities, right?

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:21.070
 There are so many diversities, ups and the don'ts and so forth, like birth and getting old and

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.920
 sicknesses and declines and that.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.680
 That is, of course, one of the big things.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:33.890
 All this change, generally, in the teachings, it is so, so important, so special, because it is a

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.360
 reminding of where the nature is.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:43.880
 It's not really hiding, hiding too much. It is really converting all of that, and that's why then

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.360
 we have a lot of spiritual opportunities to work out ourselves.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.620
 So, for example, in the Buddha's teaching, there's a God's realm, there's another realm, that which

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:55.680
 is always so happy and so good.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.780
 Everything is really comfortable, but in a way, it's just hidden, everything. It doesn't mean that

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.280
 it lasts forever like that, it's just hidden.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.850
 But here, in our world, there are so many diversity things happening. There is a lot of opportunity

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.720
 of the spiritual waking up there, and therefore, it is really very special.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:23.280
 And for those reasons, many great masters in those great practices always met so many beautiful

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:30.840
 songs, that I'm so thankful to all these obstacles came, and that's why I had this awakening energy

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:31.200
.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:41.390
 For example, the great Master Malarepa had all those difficult troubles when he was young, early

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.120
 young times, or child-born.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:51.530
 And that's why then he became the great Master Malarepa. So, that obstacle, that situation really

00:01:51.530 --> 00:02:01.220
 made him so strong, so powerful, and so courageous, and so determined to pursue something that is

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.720
 practiced, and then become the great Master Malarepa.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:33.470
 And then, as well as the great Master Malarepa, again, Malarepa did not have that many troubles as

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.500
 Malarepa, but however, in the teachings said, he had also a lot of troubles, in particular, when he

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.520
 started in his monastery universe, there's a lot of things went on and on, because that made him

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530
 too strong, that kind of pushed him to do some more, his practice, meditate, and then become the

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.920
 Malarepa.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:41.750
 So, when you read the life story of those great Masters, there's no one enlightened beings, no

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:50.130
 great Master who become, everything becomes, start with La La Land, everything kind of lies, and

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.320
 really, everyone has so many difficult troubles, that's why really they come.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:20.820
 So, for those reasons, what Namjimpa said, I'm so thankful this obstacle came, and that's why I

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:21.000
 found the Dharma, and I'm so thankful all those sickness troubles, and that's why I extend my

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.180
 courage and commitment to the practice, so I'm thankful to the sicknesses, I'm thankful to the

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.050
 obstacles, I'm thankful to all those, what's called, bad omens, spirit of these beautiful songs,

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.720
 really, Namjimpa is a giant,

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:32.840
 that, and it's just, all is, everything met him to come to wake up and bring spiritual qualities,

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:38.720
 so therefore, I mean, it is, and then, for example, our great teacher, the Buddha Shakyamuni, also,

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:46.020
 his final, of course, he's already enlightened, he's already great, but final push, to become the

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:52.720
 Buddha, is by seeing the sicknesses, old man, and then the death,

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:59.710
 the three things, his soul, pulse, and then, finally, he saw the sage or the monk, and so, these

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:06.400
 four things, kind of really met his, the final, to leave the kingdom, Buddha Shakyamuni, and then,

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:16.780
 become the Buddha, so therefore, everyone, we read life story, and their enlightenment comes, that

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.720
 start something with all these difficulties,

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:27.350
 all the situations that both, we're really writing from them, the samsara situation, and that's

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:33.720
 what they really become enlightened, so therefore, impermanent is so special, impermanent is good,

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:41.330
 is reminded us, constantly, how, where things are, and how things, and for those reasons, Buddha Sh

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:48.720
akyamuni also said in the teaching, teaching, among all the conceptions, the impermanent conception,

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.720
 or understand of the impermanent,

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:56.280
 is the supreme, that is it. When you have the samsara realization, or see the situation of the

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:02.630
 impermanent changing, then it settles your, ourselves to more, in spiritual, we can, we are

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:10.200
 grounded more, on the ground, not just hovering in the sky, sky, it makes our heart more subtle,

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:17.910
 warmer, more practical, and then, more also, open, more courageous, courageous, so therefore, the

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:19.720
 understanding of impermanence is good.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:29.720
