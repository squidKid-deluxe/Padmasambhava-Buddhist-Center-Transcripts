Khenpo Tsewang Rinpoche\n\nJanuary 1 @ 9:00 am - 5:00 pm \n33rd Annual Vajrasattva & Vajrakilaya PBC New Year\u2019s Practice!\n\nMorning Vajrasattva fire puja practice:\n9am \u2013 12:00 noon\n\nAfternoon Vajrakilaya and Dharmapala practice with tsok:\n2:00 \u2013 5:00pm\n\nLet\u2019s begin the New Year\u2019s practice with Vajrasattva and Vajrakilaya! For 33 years this is one of the very special practices that we have been able to do in New York City through the open kindness of of our dear Dharma brother John Giorno.\n\nThis Vajrasattva fire puja practice mainly focuses on pacifying negativities and obstacles while increasing prosperity, joy, longevity, peace, and realization. It is a terma of Terdak Lingpa.\n\nVajrakilaya is the embodiment of all the buddhas\u2019 activities and is one of the most famous practices of the Nyingma school. Practicing on Vajrakilaya removes our obstacles, eases the flow of Dharma activity, and reveals the Buddha nature. Daily practice of Vajrakilaya is suggested as it is very powerful. Practice on special occasions is also very beneficial.\n\nMorning Practice:\n\nDaily Prayers \u2013 Opening and Dedication\nMinling Vajrasattva Fire Puja\nRiwo Sang Chod\n\nAfternoon Practice:\n\nDaily Prayers \u2013 Opening and Dedication\nVajrakilaya \u2013 Tsasum Lingpa (short)\nDharmapala Prayers\nKuntuzangpo Prayer\nWhite Umbrella\nGreat Cloud of Blessings\n \nPadma Samye Ling\n(607) 865-8068\njowozegyal@catskill.net\n\nwww.padmasambhava.org\n\nwww.padmasambhava.org/event/2020-new-years-vajrasattva-vajrakilaya-practices-with-ven-khenpo-tsewang-rinpoche",
