00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 "Warriors, Treaty of the Warrior, is not warrior that defeated others with anger and jealous

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 and hated thought and greedy. That is not the release. This warrior is destroying the

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 root of the anger, the root of greedy, root of the jealous. That is what this warrior is.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 Therefore, this warrior-ship nature is hiding for us, all of us. We have that nature. But

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 ours are covered by the many turbulence of the negative energy, negative forces of the

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 emotions such as estimation, jealous and hated thoughts, anger, greed and all that. And the

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 Gesar is one destroying all those roots and then anger and the jealous and bring up the

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 true warrior-ship, true brilliance, which is courage, commitment and confidence, joy.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 The hidden gauntlet, that is what really Gesar is bringing up that gauntlet. Therefore, Gesar

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 is very, very special. He got a golden history when Gesar was king. Gesar came in Tibet,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 a golden teaching came in Tibet around the end of the 9th century and in the 11th century

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 around that time. And who was Gesar? Gesar was, or Gesar is, is the emanation of the

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 direct emanation of the Murapem Masambhava and then as well as emanations of the Manjushri,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 Vajrapani and Avalokrisha. Sure. So, therefore, Gesar is the embodiment of the Murapem Masambhava

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 and all these three principal Buddhas. Buddha of the body, enlightenment aspect of the Manjushri.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 Here is Avalokrishwara and the Vajrapana. Vajrapani all combined as one target, came as Gesar.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 Where Gesar came? According to the history, Gesar came in East Tibet, now known as in

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 the global areas. And there, very famous holy mountain known as Ani Matipong. Close by there,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 he came. How he came? He actually, according to the history and as well as instructions

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 of the great master Moharaju's teaching, that he came as, in a way, a very miraculous way.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 And his mother was the daughter of the Nagas who came to this world, world as to bring

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 talk of this super human beings, emanations, Gesar came. And in the kind of Wharton level,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 who was his father? His father was known as Yatsung. But it is also in the teachings that

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 as many of those great beings, as when you look at the history, the father and the mother

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 all, that's quite mysterious that we know. And every country has that. And similarly,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 at this time, according to the human level, his father was single. But, Manipupa, again

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 in the teachings said, his father was divine gods. Among there's many gods in Buddhism,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 you know that. And the gods such as Brahmins, so forth. And so now, who is he? He is, as

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 he said, he is emanation of the direct emanation of the Mgurupa and Masambhav, and as well

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 as Kiryasak, Manjushri and Vayagapani. These three principles of Buddhism, these three,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 Manjushri, Kiryasak or the Avalokiteshora and Vayagapani, those are known as three Buddhas

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 or three Bodhisattvas. They are totally enlightened beings, but yet they act as Bodhisattvas.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 But according to the enlightened level, they are the three principles of the aspect of

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 the Bodhi speech, mind of all the Buddhas. So Bodhi aspect of all the Buddhas appeared

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 such beautiful, youthful, handsome, the gorgeous looking Manjushri. This is what Manjushri

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 is, so beautiful, so handsome. Even the gods cannot match with him. The gods, according

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 to the considering the most beautiful beings on the planet or on the universe, so beautiful.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 But when Manjushri came with God, it came out of their beauty, and Manjushri is so beautiful,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 so beautiful, so bright, because he represents the enlightenment body of all the Buddhas.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:49.000
 Then the speech of the old Buddhas came as one single state of great compassion of the

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 Buddha, the Jairusai. Jairusai's voice is so beautiful, so soothing, so calming. Therefore,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 for example, we wake up like the Jairusai and join the mantras of the Jairusai, such as

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 Om Mani Pe Me Home, to the animals and to anyone. It really comes down. I feel that too.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 I had that kind of like, kind of, I myself witnessed that. When I joined, sometimes mantras

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 with the squirrels and the cheap moments, they don't pose their own way. But then when

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 I started joining Om Mani Pe Me Home, they really pass, they stop, they become curious

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 and come back Om Mani and look into you, and you join the mantras. It's true, really.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 Jim Mongs, they are really naughty too, but Jim Mongs and, what's it called, the squirrel.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 And as far as groundhouse tools. And we had that also taught one time.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 We were walking in his own Dunyuruddhi Center, upstate, that avenue there is called Osidhi,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 a beautiful center of his own Dunyuruddhi. He blessed that place. He stayed there.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 And one time we were walking on the route of the Osidhi-riti land, Kilmulhi myself.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 And one of our Sangha members there, we were all walking.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 And we saw that total, total, total. This Sangha member picked up that total.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 And he completed that total, completed the drone of his whole head and legs and everything

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 in sight and shell. Kilmulhi started joining the mantras, mostly Om Mani Pe Me.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 And the moment he started joining the mantra, really total came out of all his shells

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 on the head of that person. He came out of that.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 When he stopped the mantra, again when he joined in the mantra, again.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 So I really thought, Kilmulhi said true, true. This is what really the blessings were.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000
 Because these words are not words of the anger or the arrogance.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 The support in all of them. It is words of love, kindness and compassion.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 Calming, soothing, encouraging, encouraging, uplifting.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 Therefore Buddha often said in the teaching, join the mantras to the others

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 when the animals are dying or when you see this, this is it.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 Definitely it has, it has really effect that I can't really experience that.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 So in a way the Jainese symbolize the speech of the old Buddha.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 And then what is?

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 The Vajrapani represents all the power, the versatile mind,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 the mind of the old Buddha's power, the ability that which the symbolizes.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 Therefore Vajrapani always holds the Vajra in his head.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
 That's what is also known as Vajrapani.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 One who holds the Vajra in his head.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 That Vajra and Vajrapani symbolize the power and the abilities of the old Buddha's.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 Power and the ability of the old Buddha is power of love, compassion, truth and harmony, peace.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 That is what represents.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:39.000
 And that all three, that three of these enlightened beings come together as one sign of form.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
 Together with Gurba and Masambhava known as Kesa.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 Kesa, so therefore Kesa is known as emanation of the Gurba and Masambhava

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 and then these three Buddhas.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 And why he came?

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.840
 In the teachings said Gurba and Masambhava saw, Gurba and Masambhava in the as well as all the Budd

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:02.000
has.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
 But particularly in Gurba and Masambhava saw,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 all those negative forces are almost kind of like overcasted.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:18.000
 The earth, earth and then the kind of virtues and truth is completely dimmed out.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 To glorify the truth and virtues and dispel the overcaste of the negative forces.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 Then Gurba and Masambhava ignited or emanated power.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:38.000
 Power, power as Kesa, triggered with these three Buddhas.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:48.360
 And that is the purpose of the Kesa is to destroy or to clear away the overcaste of the negative

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:49.000
 forces

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:55.000
 and bring up the virtues and the goodness solid of the human beings, the human spirit.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 That's what the reading principle purpose of the Kesa emanates.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 So now when Kesa was born in the Kyalawal talk,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.000
 later bring under the history, the breathing that drops.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 And many of you have heard this already, many Kesa.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 There are so many Kesa stories, Kesa stories, Kesa stories.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
 Somebody wrote books and then I saw the article,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:29.000
 Kesa story is much, the biggest, biggest what?

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 What?

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 Epic, is it it?

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000
 Epic.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:40.000
 Epic, biggest epic, biggest play, play books in the world.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
 Really is it.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000
 And of course according to India, Mahabharata is very big.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
 Mahabharata is very big.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
 And also Ramayana is very big.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
 But that's it.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:12:02.000
 The Kesa, the epic or Kesa that play story is so biggest in the world.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 There are so many volumes even before.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 Like when I remember all the kind which always talks,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:14.000
 there is over 30 books, Kesa stories.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 In 18 parties or before.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
 And afterward there are so many stories.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 There are like so many books.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 Now it's coming, Kesa, books are about Kesa, over 100 books.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 When Kesa story tells, when they tell the story,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 it's also so fascinating.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
 Really it's like so fascinating.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 It's just spontaneous and who talks.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
 They are not sometimes educated.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 Educated or went to academics.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:54.000
 Or they are not just kind of only reserved such as male or males,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 females, males, chimes.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 And so many people speak, start speaking about the Kesa.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 And spontaneous, when they speak about the Kesa teachings,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
 talks about the Kesa is so beautiful.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
 It's so beautiful lyrics, so beautiful structures.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
 Boils, sentences, it's all in the colloquial levels.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
 It's easy to understand.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 One nature of this story tells,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000
 tells the courage, commitment, loyalty, peace, truth,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000
 and honesty, and defeat the negative forces,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
 and re-strengthen our one's own identity.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 The gauntlet, gauntlet of nature.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
 That is the most, and how to be friendly,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 how to be good, how to be nice,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 how to stand on the family behind what you say,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 what you say, and stay with that.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 It's all the good things, what we all think.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
 It really tells all those stories.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000
 It's so beautiful.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 But anyway, now I talk a little bit really about Kesa.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:06.000
 So now, mother is a daughter of the Nagakim,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
 and known as Goji Lam.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
 And then, this area of the gessa is called,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
 area is called length.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 L-I-N-D, length area.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 It's ruled by almost the kind of way,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 in a way, democratic, but the chips comes up.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
 It's not just always stays, it kind of comes up,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
 the rules, there is not struggling,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 fighting is inside going on,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
 how to rule the country of length,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 or that area of length.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 But yet, there is always some struggle,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
 powerful, that areas.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
 There is one book in the teachings,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 the book tells, in the future,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 there is one, the woman will come,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
 which is not really human woman, lady,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000
 and she will give the birth of one boy,

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 and that strange boy, this boy will

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
 control that land of length,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
 and not just that, but he will control

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 all of the areas and beyond.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
 Always have that pretentious.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 And according to that time,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
 when gessa was protecting the birth,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 at that time, who is controlling the length,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
 that land of length?

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:38.000
 It's controlled by his uncle,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 the father's brother.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
 Father's brother is known as totum.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 Totum is always so tricky,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
 so tricky and so smart,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
 but also very timid.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 And the teaching said, and the story said,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 totum's mother purposely gave him,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
 to man him timidly, timidly,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 she made him timidly,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
 because her whole children,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
 those boys become so courageous,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
 and they fought, fought, all died on the,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 died out, they died.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 And he don't want totum to die that way,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
 and make him very timidly.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 So in the story said,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000
 she made effort to give totum,

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 when he's a baby or boy,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 the nine times heart of pox.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000
 Heart of pox, nine times.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
 And according to it,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
 pox are, I think, in this country too.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
 But pox are very tricky, smart,

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 and also timidly, timidly.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 So totum become like that.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000
 He's smart, he's timidly,

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
 and also very tricky.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000
 He has quite foxy nature.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 He has quite foxy nature.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 But however he knows, he renders the prediction,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 prediction that strange woman,

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
 they all thought he is that strange woman

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 or the non-unhuman woman, woman.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000
 And if he give the baby, baby,

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
 strange boy, the young one, the last one,

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
 and will become the ruled country

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
 and become the leader in all these things.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 So he's always cautious

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.000
 when this goji thumb was pregnant, particularly.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
 He gave three, I mean,

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
 actually three times, babies, boys, sons,

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
 but really cautious with any others.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 But this one is very,

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.000
 when Gesar is pregnant and very cautious,

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 that in trying to prevent always what he couldn't do.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
 It's like volcano.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 Volcano, are we trying to stop?

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 We can't stop.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.000
 It will come up.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 No matter what you are doing,

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000
 for a short time maybe you can do, but it is.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
 Now the volcano of the caesare is constructed

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
 in the warmth of the goji thumb.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 And then she gave the baby birth.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000
 And he was born with very beautiful miracles, all that.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 But when the moment he was born,

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000
 again his uncle came,

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000
 trying to take away and trying to destroy,

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 but couldn't destroy at all.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 Anyway, there's so many stories, one after another.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
 But anyway, when Gesar is about four or five years old,

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
 he becomes so naughty.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
 So naughty.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 His baby, little boy,

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:05.000
 but he just become, couldn't handle, handled by the old areas.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
 Area includes all of himself.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000
 He's so tricky, he just, in a way, very mischievous.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000
 Mischievous and tricky, powerful and couldn't handle.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 They all thought, now we have to exile.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 Have to put in exile, exile, right?

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000
 Exile, the choro, and mother, choro and mother.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 Also, his mother and him started quite poor.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000
 Poor, so he don't have exile, really father.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 Father, and even though he has human father,

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000
 that we are not exactly staying chogade.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.000
 Chogade, so mother and his little boy, they have to exile.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 And all said that his brother, the elder brother,

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000
 the quesad, elder brother is very powerful.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000
 He's called Jatsa.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000
 And very powerful, very vigorous, and very courageous.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000
 Jatsa, when they say, when he courageous,

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000
 if he get angry, if he get angry,

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 he can destroy whole, whole things.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000
 He's so kind of, it's like drunk elephants.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
 But he's also so gentle and so peaceful.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
 When he's not angry.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000
 And so everybody is very cautious with his elder brother.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000
 But Vicky is not really with his, they're staying chogade.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:31.000
 He's also in the different places, in a way, in the 80s.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:37.000
 And his brother don't want to kick him completely out.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000
 Because he said, no matter whatever he do,

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.000
 he is still the proper of life.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 He is proper of life.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 He belongs to the 80.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000
 But as well as there's another very famous man,

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000
 known as Chikung.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:01.000
 Chikung is like village elder.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000
 Everybody listens to him.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000
 He knows everything.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.000
 Everything.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000
 And he is also, in a way, cheap justice.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 Cheap justice.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
 Everybody comes and listens.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000
 If he decide, he's honest, true, and fair,

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000
 and he don't really swing back and forth.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000
 He just stays in the middle.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000
 So if he decide, then that's it.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.000
 So Chikung also told, I don't think we can kick him completely out.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 Because he also belongs with our 80s,

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
 he truly comes from laying down.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.000
 We can't kick out.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 So therefore, we have to give some edge of the place,

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000
 small edge, land, and let him stay his mother and stay there.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:49.000
 So then they all kind of come together, and what he have?

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:54.000
 He had to give him one horse, all horse,

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.000
 and one cow, in a way, or pimal yaks,

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.000
 and one goat, one goat, pimal goat,

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000
 and one small yak, a tent,

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000
 and then they put in exile.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:15.000
 And not out of the completely land of length, but in the edge of the legs.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000
 So then mother and they stay there.
