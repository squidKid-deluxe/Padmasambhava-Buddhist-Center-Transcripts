00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.560
 "But the mostly, conversely, going to those chakras is 'neveled chakras' in the teaching

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:15.120
 said, 'neveled chakra'. 'Neveled chakra' is also, when we consider the time, the first

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:24.080
 time, this 'neveled chakra' is the first chakra. Chakra is formed. And it's formed 'neveled

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:31.440
 chakra' forming, and then 'neveled chakra' is formed. But 'neveled chakra' is formed

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:37.520
 at the first place, when we concept it in the mother's form. When he is going to break

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:47.680
 down, the first one is the 'neveled chakra'. And 'neveled chakra' means 'break down' in

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:57.040
 the teaching said, then the 'art' element is beginning to dissolve. The 'art' element

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:05.760
 is dissolving to the water elements, so 'art' element is dissolved. And when that happened,

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:13.040
 that happened, in the teaching said, external science, you will feel 'heem'. And who maybe

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:21.040
 will say, 'ask it, please, raise me up, lift me up'. And also, I think, that time, the wind

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:31.840
 energy is known as the pervasive wind is losing its control or its balance, or pervasive wind.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:39.360
 And therefore, your lens starts getting off, individual, that individual lens starts getting

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:51.440
 cold, cold. And those are called the external science. In that science, then, the mind becomes

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:57.760
 kind of also dull too, dull. And the simple science, in the teaching said, there is a

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:10.960
 lot of like, what's called, kind of 'merati' visions come. Merati-looking visions are rising up.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:17.360
 And so, when that happened, then it is affected immediately. The next state, not immediately,

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.520
 I mean, depends individually on how long it takes. Gradually, it could be, it could be

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:30.400
 10, a little longer, but anyway, then, next state is, then, heart chakra. It breaks.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:46.440
 And here, the great, this is Jaxanungasu teaching. Jaxanungasu teaching, I mean, Jaxanungas

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:54.920
 Themmo, Themmo, and his chaturp practices. This is kind of a very, the extra that I didn't

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:02.360
 see in other teachings, so many times, many times, not often. But here, in this teacher,

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.440
 of course, this is the teacher of Mguropa and the symmetry again. But here say, when the

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:15.240
 heart element is begin to dissolve, that what it does, it also break down the functioning of the

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:26.200
 pancreas, pancreas. It break down the pancreas and then, then, the sign is the same, different.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:35.080
 So, it's fine print. In a organ level, it affect the pancreas, pancreas. With this element,

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:46.520
 that, and then, heart chakra now is affected, or sooner than heart chakras. When heart chakra is,

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:56.120
 is, is, the function is dissolving, the inward signs, signs, minds become also now

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:07.320
 come restless, become more shaky, more shaky, and external signs of that individually become

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:18.040
 little short temples, short, short temples. And there's, of course, many signs, but those are the

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:29.640
 high light signs. And then, serious signs. Now, there is, is like smoking kind of, like smoking

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:38.280
 vegans kind of, smoking vegans. Now, this sign, what element is also not functioning? It's then,

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:52.120
 water element is dissolving known as pi to the pi elements. Water element. And when that happens,

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:57.880
 in that individual is, the external signs, more than everything is become kind of a little dry,

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:06.280
 very dry. At this time, in what, in the, in the satsang moments teaching, say, that time,

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:17.400
 then the kidney problems are breaking down, breaking down. So, the inner organ, the kidney is,

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:29.480
 is, is, is affected. Now, when that happens, happens, then gradually legislate is the spit chakras.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:50.520
 Spit chakra is now dissolved, or the dysfunction. Functionally, an element level, that time,

00:05:50.520 --> 00:06:00.760
 the higher element is dissolved to the wind elements. And in science, external science,

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:09.800
 and that is, then that individuals having more short breathing, or breathing,

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:20.200
 become very irregulars, irregulars. At the same time, mind again is, what's called, emotions are

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:31.720
 let a half stop. And secretary sign, that individual is experiencing, like almost like mostly, fire

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:32.200
flies.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:41.560
 Fireflies, right? Yeah, fireflies. Fireflies. In that time, what,

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:53.560
 yeah, so, come on.

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:25.000
 Did I say this satsang was teaching? No. Not this one, right? Not the organ's body. Not, okay.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:38.040
 And it may come a long time. If fire is dissolved to the wind element, at that time, then the liver

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:38.040
,

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:47.000
 liver functioning, is stopped. What's, yeah, is stopped.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:08:02.600
 When, when this, that happened, now the spit chakra is unfunctioning, or gone. And that,

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:13.320
 when that happened, then what is does, does, then the, the next chakra, pit chakra, pit chakra is

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:24.360
 secret chakra. The secret chakra is then disfunctioning. When the secret chakra is disfunctioning,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:34.280
 then that moment, what's happening, the wind element is now dissolving to the consciousness,

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:44.360
 consciousness. With this happened, then the breathing become long, external sound,

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:56.920
 very long, and very kind of hard, hard. And inwardly, this individually is experiencing,

00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:09.160
 saying, what is the sign? Sign is then as like flames, kind of like flame, flame of all, yeah,

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:18.680
 flame, flame looking, looking signs, appearing in the secret hours.

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:30.920
 And that moment, then the water, the organ is disfunctioning, is then the lungs, lungs are

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:47.480
 stopping. Yeah, lungs are stopping. And that moment, generally, according the,

00:09:48.440 --> 00:10:03.320
 then it's called out of breathing. It's actually really stopped.
