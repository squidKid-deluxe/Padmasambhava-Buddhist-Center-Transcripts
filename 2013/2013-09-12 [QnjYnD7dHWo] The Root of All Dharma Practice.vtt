 "This is encouragement, again encouragement, as well as relieving, relief, encouragement, all you

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.360
 can do. You can do. It's not something that you cannot do.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:19.450
 And this is something, again, to condense it, all the instructors in the great Mahatma Mahamud

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.040
 highlight it.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:30.800
 It condenses that all what Nagarjuna taught, he kind of condenses it. You can put this, this, this,

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:41.040
 here, here, here. And you can do that. It's condense everything. That is the fearless one.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.530
 The fearless one, again, to referring to the King. You are the fearless person. I don't have to

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:58.400
 tell many things. But however, with my unreal heart, heart, I like to say one more, something that

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.040
 will become so beneficial to you.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:17.900
 What is that? That is, if you are able to explain, condense your mind, mind. That is the Buddha

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.040
 said. That is the root of all the Dharma practices.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:26.920
 Root of all these teachings, what Nagarjuna went through. From the beginning, tell hunter that if

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:38.790
 you are able to, if you do, calm down like peaceful, our discipline, that is the essence, the root

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.040
 of Dharma.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:48.950
 That, that is so valuable that every instruction, the detailed instruction, what he went through,

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:58.240
 calm down one thing. Display, watch our mind, or watch your mind. Display your mind. Watch your

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.040
 mind.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:09.930
 If you do this, all the teachings are condensed in one simple word, teaching status. And the next

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.040
 one is, again.
