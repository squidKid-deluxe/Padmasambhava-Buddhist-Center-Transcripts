00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.720
 Thank you very much, everyone. Mahi Dalits. Again, welcome, everyone. Again, to be again.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:25.080
 Together, we are going to wrap a letter, a teaching of the hour, a gracious, oh, grando, grando,

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.800
 gracious teacher of the bodhasha javan. And so thank you very much also for participating

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:38.040
 and welcome everyone. Okay, thank you. And then also, we will follow the light, the light

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:45.040
 or torch of the hour to have the new teaching and which is so concise and so precise and

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:51.440
 which continue going on these teachings. The heart advised for the fortunate ones. Truly

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:59.080
 we are all almost in the ones. And His Holiness, Ochabjidunu, which is giving us this beautiful

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:07.400
 instructions and wires so that we can touch and keep in our heart and cherish and glorify

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:14.880
 our teaching of the practices, what we receive, what we learn. So glorify them. And that is

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:23.520
 wonderful. And for those reasons, again, the brain or visual motivations such as your appreciation

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.000
 and as well as vastness, the motivation of the both each other for all living beings and

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.720
 the purity, motivation or the teaching of the very other teachings and trying to activate

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:42.440
 all those beautiful qualities. And then we go in the teaching, teaching itself. And the

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.560
 teaching itself, I'm going to again summarize this, I'm going to talk many other things,

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:54.720
 so I'll talk while we go to the point. As we discuss it all, this practice, when I really

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:02.160
 come to the practices, it's so important to put these three frames. The beginning good,

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:10.360
 middle good, and concluding good. And sometimes I use the terminology, beginning noble, middle

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:19.520
 noble, and the continuing noble. And whatever the terminology is, it is noble, it is good,

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:27.160
 it is excellent, not just for only ourself, but all the living beings. It's good now,

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:35.040
 it's good forever. Ever, it is really excellent. And therefore, again, that is the frame. In

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:42.360
 that frame, again, we went on this first one is the motivation. And if I clearly kind of

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:49.080
 understand the reflecting of the poor training of the mind, and then also kind of close the

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:56.680
 feeling to the Buddha Dhamma Sangha and extending and rising up the enlightened mind or the

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:06.600
 body, together with the devotions. Devotion is the topping, or there is the cream of the practices

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:14.440
 that we are, it's all best on the beautiful motivation. And the devotion is joy, devotion

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:22.560
 is appreciation, devotion is faith, the preciousness. Preciousness of our self, preciousness of the

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:30.560
 lineage, precious all the satisfaction. And also devotion has some determinations that I'm going

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:38.080
 use this all precious opportunity to make some even more precious for me and for all the things.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:47.280
 Those are really known. With that, then we go to the principle noble, middle noble, or middle good,

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:54.560
 and which is according to bodhicitta level, as I say, kind of use the frame, actualizing both each

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:02.960
 other. So that is actualizing bodhicitta. And that actualizing bodhicitta is summarized into six

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:10.560
 paravatas practices. Six paravatas practices. Actualizing bodhicitta is absolutely best upon

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:21.240
 the reaching bodhicitta. That means actualizing bodhicitta is absolutely best upon poor, boundless,

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:30.200
 and the lonely practices. The only practice I'm using that terminology in the Western, that is

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:38.440
 quite popular name. Everybody, almost everybody knows that name. The way the Buddhist practitioners

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:45.920
 I think knows, means equalizing. It only has three different signs. Equalizing, that means all

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:46.600
 living

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:52.080
 beings are equal. And we went those kind of meanings. There will be details, I'm sure you

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:58.130
 remember, and you already know that those things. And the second is then tungli, which is the

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:58.440
 English

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:08.400
 translation, exchanging, exchanging. And third one is others are more important than one

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:16.720
 own self. Those all three are, I'm using as tungli practice, which is best upon, again,

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:23.720
 these four bones, so we can move each other. We knew that is strong. Now we're going to actualize

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:31.360
 physically, verbally, that intuition. That means into practice. We're going to put that into

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.920
 practice.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:39.920
 Now, surely we're going to. And that is then six paramata practices. Six paramata practices. That

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:47.840
 actualizes. And that is then, those six paramatas are generous paramata, morality paramata,

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:58.400
 patience paramata, and your effort paramata, concentration paramata, and wisdom paramatas.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:05.400
 Those are known as the sixth paramata practices that, of course, we all know that. I'm talking

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:11.120
 this not just so that you don't know. I'm just talking as to what we went through. In that sense,

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:18.080
 I'm talking. So, six paramata practices. And among those six, we went kind of really,

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:26.960
 all the details on those three paramatas, first three paramatas, which is generosity, morality,

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:35.360
 and of course, sorry, the patient paramatas. Those three are we went. We went one after another.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:42.480
 And again, as I said, earlier in the teaching of the Buddha, all these paramatas are totally

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:51.360
 connected. One after another, they're not different at all. They're all connected. The first one is

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:56.240
 connected to the second one. The second one is connected to the third, third, and fourth. I mean,

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:04.000
 all connected line. And also, for example, the second paramata is more profound than the first

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:11.840
 one. And third paramata is more profound than the first and second. And fourth paramata is more

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:18.200
 profound than the first and second and third. It goes on and on. I trust the Pandya paramatas,

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:24.440
 Pandya paramata, all that. Because of how the greatest teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni, told that

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:32.800
 "exhiling according to capability, readiness according to that." So he just gradually leading

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:41.080
 us to the deeper meaning of the true nature and exploring the goodness of ours and benefiting

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:48.360
 from all that, all the beings. This is also known as one of the skill means of the way to lead

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:56.360
 practitioners to the path, to the enlightenment or path of enlightenment by the Buddha. Never

00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:06.680
 post, never burst, never burst according to readiness. But stay, stay fast, stay fast,

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:19.400
 continue until goal is achieved, or discover, fulfill. So that is how that is. And that way,

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:24.200
 now today, we are in the fourth paramata. I'm going to look at the fourth paramata.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:31.880
 Fourth paramata is joyful effort paramata. In English, that's what we're translating,

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:39.960
 or at least I'm translating that way. Or another way, this fourth paramata is simple. It is effort,

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:49.480
 effort paramata. I said it's effort. It's effort paramata. This effort paramata is,

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:57.880
 in Sanskrit, named as bhriya. So as we went, all the other paramatas, the three paramatas,

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:08.840
 so we go the whole meaning of the effort paramata, and the nature of the effort paramata,

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:19.240
 and as well as division or the benefit of the effort paramatas. Paramatas are those ways.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:27.640
 And division of the paramatas, or the effort paramatas, those ways. So first is the whole

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:35.400
 meaning of the paramatas. And as he said already, in Sanskrit, it is known as bhriya. And you all

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:42.040
 know that bhriya paramatas. That which is translated into Tibet. Actually, those great

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:50.600
 translators, emanated translators, or masters, and both Indian and Tibetan masters, or translators,

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:59.720
 translated that into as sundru, bhriya as sundru. Sundru means continuation effort.

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:08.440
 That is really the meaning of it. So this sundru is not just a one-day show or short-time show,

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:21.640
 but it is a continuation. The nature of this effort, then it comes joy. Joyful. Joyful effort

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:22.520
 continuation.

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:33.160
 It's not boring. It's not tiring. It's not just a desperate situation, but joyful effort.

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:45.320
 Why? Because it is long last goal that we're going to achieve. Long last vision that we lost it

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:55.720
 without regard. Regained back. What that means? We lost our goal, our ordinal goal, our ordinal

00:10:55.720 --> 00:11:05.400
 richness, our ordinal precious nature. By due to our mistakes of ignorance and duality, for a long

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:15.720
 time we lost it. Really lost it. And that is our ordinal nature. We lost the midst of our own

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:23.240
 creation of the dreamland. Creations. We were wondering that so many lifetimes, according to

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:32.600
 the greatest teacher, for the biggest time, we are wondering on the nightmare of the dreams

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:41.720
 that created by one's own. And wondering, wondering. We went ups and downs and not really went

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:48.600
 anything higher than that. Just in samsara going up and up and down, up and up, down and down,

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:57.000
 just all the time. And creating so much again delusions, so many the cause and the root and

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:04.920
 the branches of the of the dualities and creating and that reflected bouncing back us exactly say

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:12.520
 as a like nightmare. We went through that so many times, so long time, thinking we are doing

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:20.200
 something but we just almost come what's called struggling to come out of them or come out of the

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:28.200
 nightmare yet we couldn't fulfill. We completely lost our point and look in the wrong directions.

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:37.960
 We've been there. And to now by the teaching of the greatest teacher, kindness, compassion teacher,

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:47.000
 wise and versatile teacher taught the clay path, clay technique, how to regain back

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:56.600
 the long lost our beautiful nature richness. To discover this, we need long lost

00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:05.720
 courage, commitment and your combined target continuation. That is really known as the

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:15.240
 joyful effort. Joyful effort in the teaching said very famous Buddha sattara teaching known as

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:23.480
 lord yamsu huba sattaras, sattara that caused by the lord yamsu, bodhisattva lord yamsu.

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:31.480
 In that teaching said, say if you don't have or we don't have the joyful effort,

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:39.080
 no matter how much all the parameters we have is not going to bring the fulfillment.

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:47.960
 The fulfillment of the all the other parameters absolutely depended upon the joyful effort.

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:57.240
 If we don't have the joyful effort, that means we're not going to improve at all.

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:05.080
 That means we're not going to benefit to any ones. That means include one's own self.

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:13.240
 Don't measure the others. If we don't have the joyful effort, we're not going to get enlightenment.

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:26.040
 But at all, therefore absolutely enlightenment is best upon the joyful effort. Or this joyful

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:26.360
 effort.

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:36.600
 Joyful effort, joyful effort so so important. It's just crucial. It's a force, moving force.

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:46.760
 As I said, patient paramata is like bad bombs. Joyful, it's like moving force with the muscle.

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:53.160
 Muscle. If you have just only the skill of alone, it's not going to work.

00:14:53.160 --> 00:15:02.760
 But when we have the joyful effort, then we have that the generous paramata is moving forward.

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:11.320
 Morality paramata is improving and the passion will be steady and then effort will track.

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:20.200
 Truly that truly that will take us to other shows with all the other gratitude paramatas

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:27.000
 which is concentration paramata and western paramatas. So this joyful effort is in the

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:34.520
 teaching said as we mentioned too many times. It's joyful and is vital or in the polls

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:41.720
 to perform all the paramatas. And therefore it's called support of all the paramatas.

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:49.000
 Joyful effort is the moving force of a generous paramata. Joyful effort is the moving force of

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:59.400
 the morality paramata. Joyful effort paramata is the kind of steady moving, stabilizing the

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:07.720
 patient paramata and as well as concentration paramata and western paramata. It's really

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:17.720
 so so important, so special, so powerful. And this is again why we don't have joyful effort.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:31.000
 Because of the laziness. That is laziness. It's struggle. When we are under the control of

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:41.400
 laziness, nothing is going to improve. That we know in samsara. Even samsara activities,

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:50.440
 we don't have the effort. And generally in the Buddha's teaching, we have the effort and the joy

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:57.560
 of the samsara activity. That is not considered as the joyful paramata. Joyful effort paramata.

00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:04.920
 Samsara activity of joyful is in the Buddha teaching. I will talk later. It comes later.

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:12.280
 It's a form of laziness. Excited with the kind of like activities of the

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:19.640
 sargulas, samsara activity. Many times, of course, we think it's effort. It's true effort. But it's

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:27.400
 not what we're talking about in the Buddha's teaching. Paramata, joyful effort. It's opposite.

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:38.840
 Opposite effort. So anyway, again, whatever it is with the laziness, it comes. Then it completely

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:48.840
 overpowers. It slows down everything. Nothing is going to move. Move. It's like tropical depression

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:48.840
.

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:59.800
 Standing in the low levels, there's no wind. It stays. It's just pounding. Whatever the weather

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:09.880
 is, it's just pounding right above us. That means pounding the storm of the duality.

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:17.400
 The nightmare is really pounding us. There's no wind. Opposite effort is moving there.

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:29.000
 You just can create more and more. That is what it is. Therefore, even in teachings,

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:36.440
 even you have the good wisdoms. Wisdoms, if you don't have the joyful effort, that's not going to

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:43.400
 happen. Now, no matter what you are, the great master Jumu Gomparsehi in his teachings,

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:51.960
 for example, there is a boat, there is a sailor, sailor in a boat,

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:57.240
 and everything is ready. But if you don't have the what do you call it? Rolling.

00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:14.440
 Rolls. If you don't have the oars, that's nothing. It just doesn't matter. If there is a sailor,

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:24.760
 there is a boat, it's nothing. It's all. It's joyful effort, it's all. And it stops.

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:34.360
 It stops. And there is again, if you have the skills and the method of relatedness,

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:40.600
 it really won't drop anything. There are stories. I tell the stories. Stories, I'm sure,

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:47.560
 maybe it's a similar story in the West, too. And it's the ancient stories. Ancient times,

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:55.640
 in one area, there is, of course, many things. But there, in that area, there is one rabbit

00:19:55.640 --> 00:20:03.720
 and one total stay. And they stay, they both stay in the same area. They're kind of happy

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:09.800
 and excited with that. And then one time, there's discussions. Discussions.

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:18.280
 And they say, "Who owns these mountains? Who owns this?" I think the

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:25.560
 pro or the rabbit said, one of those said, "I own this rabbit. I've been loner than you."

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:33.720
 And others said, "Also, I've been here too long time. I own this mountain. I own."

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:38.600
 So they both had, they both are friends, but they both started kind of talking that way.

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:46.840
 So they said, "Okay, now, then with the rabbit, sorry, the frog pointed to the rabbit. Okay,

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:53.080
 then, if that's the case, we're going to recapture our ownership of the mountain.

00:20:53.080 --> 00:21:01.560
 Therefore, whoever, God, is taught this mountain, mountain, tomorrow at the dawn,

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:08.520
 when the sun hits on the mountain, whoever is able to come up there at that time,

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:22.840
 that will own the mountain." When frog initiated that purpose, or when he proposed that idea,

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:30.120
 rabbit immediately thought, "Wow, that is just a piece of cake. I can get this so fast.

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:38.920
 How truly, I will be winner. I will be winner." So, rabbit got so much confidence, so much

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:39.560
 confidence.

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:47.480
 And so, then they decided that, "Tomorrow, whoever gets in the wrap right on top of the mountain,

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:55.000
 whenever the sun hits at the mountain, then that time they're going to say, 'Oh, I'm here.' Whoever

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:04.600
 ask that, so then others are just don't get there. I mean, whoever can get post, they're going to

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:12.440
 announce that I'm here." So that's what they made the decisions. So now, rabbit was very happy and

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:16.940
 excited. I will be there, up there in the mountain, top of the mountain, and he just said, "

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:18.440
Whatever

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:26.360
 you do, in many days, I will be up there whenever I'm short of twice." And frog thought, and

00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:26.680
 thought,

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:35.160
 "Now I said already that statement, and if I don't make my effort, I won't be up there,

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:47.480
 and I will be losing. Therefore, I will start my journey right now." So that night, frog started

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:56.200
 the journey, and he climbed up and climbed up all the way there. And now, the sun is almost coming

00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:02.360
 out, and the rabbit falls asleep. He woke up so quickly, and he remembered those statements.

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:08.600
 He ran, and the mountain closed again, and the rabbit on top of the mountain, frog said,

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:16.920
 "I'm here already." He announced, he was the winner. So why that happened? Because

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:30.440
 the joyful effort determined off of the frog, who was the top of the mountain when dawn is,

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:40.680
 and the rabbit fell asleep. Laziness of the sleep completely prevented his ownership

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:49.720
 of the mountain. So that is one of the stories. Stories. Wow, what is really that? Even you have

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:55.720
 that. And there are so many beautiful stories, one after another really, so many stories.

00:23:55.720 --> 00:24:03.720
 Ancient times, again, these are stories. There are two beautiful friends. Both are young,

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:12.200
 and one is a very wealthy boy, and the other is very poor, but they become really good friends.

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:20.040
 But others, the wealthy people, it's quite good-looking. At the same time, he was very smart,

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:27.480
 and the poor people is, that person is not so smart. But they both went to school,

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:35.880
 school, and everybody is honoring that, the wealthy boy, wealthy boy because he belongs to

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:42.600
 wealthy families. Even though he's really not studying, even though he's good wisdom,

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:48.680
 but he's not studying. Studying, but everybody is honoring him. He's, "Oh, you got this and that."

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:58.200
 They're going to make all those different stories. But these poor people, poor boys did not get any

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:06.200
 acknowledges. Even though he's studying so well, he knows so well. So well, but to say he's a

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:06.360
 little

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:14.600
 bit kind of like, not so smart as like that, that rich boy. So because of his poor family,

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:21.960
 not acknowledging it at all, in a way. But then they started continuing, and they see,

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:29.800
 now the poor people is really getting so smart and so expert, so expert on what they're studying,

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:37.320
 become very knowledgeable and understandable. And even the taste when they give, they kind of,

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:45.320
 always those teachers or workers are kind of really supportive that rich boys, not, but however,

00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:50.440
 there's a head of the master, realize that there's something going on, there's something wrong

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:50.840
 going

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:59.160
 on. And that is not correct, because he's so, that his poor boy, the poor family is really so

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:06.280
 educated. He was so strong, even though maybe he's not, not so smart, but he's now because his

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:13.960
 continuation effort, he becomes strong. So then it openly, this head master give them test,

00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:23.560
 test to all of them. And when they give them, among all the students, this poor boy become

00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:34.120
 the first, he got a plus, a plus. And this, the rich people, boy from the rich family,

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:46.280
 he got just what's called third degrees, third levels. So that is because his effort, his effort,

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:54.600
 continuation, he started. So therefore, this is really, if you don't have the effort, no matter

00:26:54.600 --> 00:27:00.600
 whatever, how much smart you are, it's not going to fulfill the goal, goal, what we're looking at.

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:09.800
 So therefore, this joyful effort is so, so important, so special, so, so beautiful. Now the

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:20.120
 benefit of this joyful effort, and it was saved, it has all those benefits as in the great teaching

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:29.160
 of the Sutraalaykara. Sutraalaykara, or the ornament of the Sutra, by teaching of the great master

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:37.160
 Asenga, or the Maite, the future Buddha Maite, is called, there's five trees, three trees of five

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:47.480
 famous books of the, of the Maite teaching, and which is born and taught by the Asenga, the great

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:55.560
 Indian master Asenga taught, among them, no, this one is known as the, was the Sutraalaykara,

00:27:55.560 --> 00:28:04.600
 or an intuitive though the G. In that teaching, said that each of those parameters has four powers,

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:13.000
 and they are, only the one is different, but the rest is quite similar. And I mentioned earlier too

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:13.000
,

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:20.520
 all the last three parameters. I mentioned that about, about, about this four point with the

00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:27.640
 generous parameter, and morality parameter, and patient parameter, and again, I will talk that

00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:34.600
 again, just say, I mean, list the names, there's nothing much to say. The fourth one is, this each

00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:44.760
 parameter, when you bring that qualities into action, it will immediately dispel the opposite,

00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:54.040
 opposite. So what that will do? What is that joyful effort? Movement will bring the joyful effort

00:28:54.040 --> 00:29:02.680
 in an active status, it will dispel the opposite of joyful effort. Opposite of joyful effort is

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:13.000
 laziness. That will be dispelled, dispelled. When the laziness is dispelled, then what it brings?

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:19.960
 Then it is continually procured status, then it will bring realization of the emptiness,

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:27.320
 second is realization of the emptiness, pretty from the subject, object, and activities, also

00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:38.200
 polluted, pretty from the grasping of the dualities, or clingings, that. Then third benefit of that

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:38.200
,

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:43.560
 when that happened, then your love and your completely motivated has grown so strongly, so

00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:44.760
 beautifully.

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:52.280
 Therefore, it will fulfill the wishes of others. It will fulfill the wishes, third benefit.

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:58.840
 It is the same as like other parameters. It will fulfill the wishes of others, and yours too.

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:11.800
 The dual purpose will be now on the fulfilling process. And the fourth benefit, because of our

00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:18.760
 bodhisattva, all the bodhisattva activities, it will also inspire the other practice, other

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:26.280
 individuals who are connected to this, your paramata practices. It will inspire their designated,

00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:35.640
 connected to the path. That means, connected to the path of their, connected to the path of the

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:42.920
 shravokayana, partic bodhayana, and bodhisattva yanas. And then it brings their final hope,

00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:53.880
 realization, finally. Final hope is aha-tahul, and as well as bodhahul, it will break. So those are

00:30:53.880 --> 00:31:04.360
 known as the whole benefit of these, those parabria parameter or joyful effort parameters.

00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:14.840
 So that is. Now we go back to the division of joyful effort. Division of joyful effort is,

00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:28.520
 is known as the first is, is, ah, maybe I just roughly translated this now. It was in my English.

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:39.720
 Roughly translation is, is amore-like parameters, amo, a-r-m-o-u-r, I believe, amore-like

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:40.600
 parameters.

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:50.280
 And, sorry, amore-like joyful effort, amore-like joyful effort. And the second is,

00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:59.080
 is continuation, the continuation joyful effort parameter.

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:13.880
 And then third one is joyful effort, effort never stopping, never stopping, stopping joyful effort.

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:22.600
 Those are the three parameters, oh sorry, three joyful effort parameters. Those are three.

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:31.400
 The fourth one, I say amore-like parameters, amore-like, also is known as the, the,

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:41.800
 just discouragement, not having the discouragement, not having the discouragement, amore-like

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:42.600
 parameters.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:53.640
 Now that means not discouragement. That means confidence, commitment, or the determination.

00:32:53.640 --> 00:33:02.280
 That means you have more patient, more tolerance, more strongman, but then it's continuation.

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:13.560
 And the second is, is, and continue, johra-mako, never pulsing, or never stopping, never stopping,

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:27.080
 stopping, continuation, joyful effort, as like river, as like river, continually flowing, flowing.

00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:36.840
 And the third one is, again, I'm making more details of that. Third one is, never says enough

00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:47.800
 to do the good things, never stopping, never say it's enough, and the good things, what better

00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:56.440
 means practices of the parameters. I'm not going to say oh it's enough, my generous practices,

00:33:56.440 --> 00:34:05.800
 it's enough my morality practices, it's enough my passion practices, it's enough my concentration

00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:14.680
 practices, never going to say, it's never that. All I'm not going to say, never going to say,

00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:21.320
 is enough my starting of the teachings, never going to say, contemplate on the teachings,

00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:28.840
 never going to say, it's always enough my meditation practices, continue with that,

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:36.120
 and to get the vision. So those are known as three divisions of parameters,

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:44.520
 or Briya parameter, joyful effort parameters. Then I will just list three names, but opposite of

00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:44.840
 this

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:54.040
 joyful effort, this as I already said, and you all know that today, it's laziness, laziness.

00:34:55.560 --> 00:35:01.800
 This is laziness, there's three laziness, highlighted by the gracious teacher,

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:07.640
 Buddha saktaman, three laziness. The sloppy laziness,

00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:20.440
 pale, sloppy laziness, self-blaming laziness, laziness of the old habit patterns

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:32.760
 that has no benefits to you, or to oneself, to the others. Those are known as three lazinesses.

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:42.600
 So that is what really about the laziness, laziness, and also really about the joyful effort

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:50.040
 talks, joyful effort parameter talks for today, and now I'm going to start here, here for today,

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:55.800
 and then thank you very much again for participating, and really participating in practicing.

00:35:55.800 --> 00:36:00.840
 Thank you again, thank you so much, thank you, thank you, and now we do the

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:19.640
 very short meditation, and then we're going to do the peeling practices.
