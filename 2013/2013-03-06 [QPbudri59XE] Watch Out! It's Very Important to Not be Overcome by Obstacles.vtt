00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 "To do this, now we have to think of what is really demons. What is a demon? And that, in a minute,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:20.810
 maybe somebody could think, 'Oh, this is just a superficial, superficial of the spiritual or the

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.000
 Dharma.' Superficial.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:35.940
 But what demon here means has many meanings. Demon means obstacles. Whether we have the belief or

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:45.440
 not, whether we have the spiritual or not, whether we have the Dharma or not, every living being

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:52.000
 goes through some degree of obstacles. Nobody can deny that.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:01.930
 This is what obstacles. Obstacles can, maybe we can say, crisis, different crises that we go

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:09.120
 through. Not just only the beginning of the practices or beginning of our lives, but even during

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:15.000
 the lives, during the journey of the spirituals, these obstacles come.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:26.970
 Christ comes, spiritual crisis, financial crisis, life crisis, failure crisis. I mean that we know

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:34.000
 all obstacles. In the Buddha teaching, many major obstacles or in Christianity, there are many,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:43.800
 whether we use the terminology as crisis or the obstacles or the hindrance, but truly, everybody

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:44.000
 experiences.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:54.960
 We will go through them. Therefore, we have to prepare that. Not just ignore and put on sight and

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:03.000
 just blend it ourselves. We have to prepare. That is what the teaching is taught.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.430
 Teaching is done. We have to make sure that we are strong and firm and challenge that we will also

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:18.780
 get. When you enter the Dharma practice, Dharma means it's not something that immediately we become

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.000
 in a lala lens, or everything will be all great.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:32.970
 Here my day is so beautiful, everything is going my way, ho ho. Some will just say that. Maybe that

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:39.000
 could be a few days, a few times, but not all the way. I mean that we know.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.760
 Even the great masters, when you read the life story of the Buddha, Shakta Muni, he is totally in

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:55.200
 like beings. He experiences obstacles, hindrance, but obstacles not become obstacles, not become

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.000
 crisis, overcome, went through.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:06.620
 That's what these great beings are known as, the warriors. They defeat that. Not defeated by anger

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:13.000
 and jealousy, hate and thought, but defeated by understanding nature itself.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:22.410
 They harmonize that. Totally harmonize that. That is what we should do. This is what this teaching

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.000
 means.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.880
 Many times, this is what, for example, in the Buddha teaching, this is, of course, again, where

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.000
 they are teaching, in another teaching.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:41.190
 In the Buddha teaching, every, every, like, you heard five brumis, sorry, five parts. Every part,

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.000
 there is some obstacle comes.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:54.870
 Every brumis, there is obstacle comes. Not just every brumis, but even during the year-end brumis,

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:02.070
 such a high level that there is obstacle comes. Obstacles are not necessarily bad. Obstacles are

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.000
 clear way.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 You are cleansing. You are cleaning your chimneys. You are cleaning, we are cleaning our chimneys.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 We are cleaning our separate sustenance. We are cleaning, really.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:27.630
 It's nothing bad. It's good. It's coming. For that reason, great master, master Tomi Zanggu said,

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:35.380
 in one of his teachings, he said, "How wonderful are these obstacles. Wonderful that I am cleaning

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.000
 now. I am cleaning. Great.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:47.990
 If obstacle didn't come, I am also how wonderful. I can move forward." So it's open. It's not just

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:54.000
 a restricted attitude that you set and like to be set by ego, cleanse, egos.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 We've been doing that forever. Long time ago, the Buddha teaching, from the biggest times, times,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 every time we like to be set in this, that way, but never achieved.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:14.910
 We always punish it by hope and fear, and that is playing ping pong ball, us. We've been the pong p

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.000
ong ball, ourself. Ourself, we've become pong pong ball.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:27.920
 Hope and fear are playing games. That's what we do. Today, we like to come out of this. We like to

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:34.640
 move forward that. Hope and fear become as favorable support for our understanding of the way of

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.000
 the path of realization.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:44.810
 And for those reasons, the Buddha teachings are so meticulous, so designed perfectly so that we

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:47.000
 cannot go any place.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:55.060
 For example, highways, like I-95, every corner, every place, there is science. It tells how much

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.000
 speed you do, what is happening, what is happening.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.630
 It's happening pretty soon, and that's what the old teaching is designed. It's our journey, journey

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:05.000
.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:12.850
 When we take this journey, the voyage, voyages, it's not always just like, like, like as smooth,

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:15.000
 there is traffic games.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 There is speed, what's called, there is traffic games and traffic lights, traffic lights.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 And there is also thunderous, and as well as also secular, or hurricanes, so forth.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 You can see, but what it means, we are moving forward. We are moving forward.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.570
 In that way, these obstacles in the Buddha teaching, generally, what, and of course, there is a

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:54.000
 kind of summarize there, what the Buddha teaching says, there is four obstacles, four demons.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 Four demons. Those are known as the demon of aggregates, demon of emotions, the demon of death,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 and the demon of distractions. These are the four demons.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:23.140
 They are not demon as a kind of individual standing. They, we use them, they are not demon, as

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:24.000
 medicines.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:32.690
 Every medicine is medicines, but if we use our dosage, then medicine, not medicine, medicine

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:36.000
 becomes poison, that we all know.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 So that means, we have to be smart, balance, and move forward.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 Demon of aggregates, that means, these aggregates also can become obstacles.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 What are our aggregates? Our poem aggregates.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:01.000
 Poem means, if we take this personally, as our body, body aggregates.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 Body, this can become obstacles to you. Therefore, we have to take care of this body.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:13.630
 It didn't mean, body is bad, we have to neglect it, or throw this, when body crash comes, we say,

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:16.000
 oh, body is not good, I'm going to leave that.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 We cannot. Body is so important, so speaking.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 Then what is another aggregates? Feelings, feeling aggregates. Feeling is also very good,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:38.930
 but however, we again use the wrong way and too sensitive way, where feeling can be again obstacles

00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:39.000
.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:46.580
 That's what means. It's all how Buddha taught, so careful, so smart, it's not just careful, exactly

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:48.000
 where things are.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:58.170
 Things can turn out, this is not Buddhism, Dharma, Buddhist talking, we can experience ourself, it

00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:00.000
's true.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 Feeling can be also obstacles. And the next one is what?

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 Next one is what? What? Perception? Yeah, perception. Perception aggregates.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:24.200
 Perception aggregates again, it didn't mean perception is bad, but perception means, again, we

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:26.000
 attach it too much.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 Perception again is known as, Dharma text is known as, Dushy. Dushy means is perception concept,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 yeah, I think perception must be, but it also means idea.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 It's idea. Idea, we have so many ideas. Idea can be very good.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 But many times, idea can become so hindrance, so obstacles. That also means believing.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:05.760
 Believing generally is good, but again, believing sometimes becomes so disturbances, disturbance to

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:09.000
 ourself, to the others.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:19.000
 So, therefore, watch out within perceptions. And the next one is what? Conservation.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 Conservation means, again, now, mental states. Mental states.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 We have to again, mental state means, conception aggregate is nothing also bad.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:40.950
 Generally, if we become too much like with mental activities, mental things, then it becomes again,

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:43.000
 obstacle, then demon.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 That's what is named demons. Then, last aggregate, among the five aggregates, is consciousness.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
 Consciousness is the source of all these aggregates.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 If we didn't take care, again, right way, consciousness is simple way, you can say, mind.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 Again, it can be obstacle. Therefore, watch out. Careful. Be balanced.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000
 That is what the teacher means.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 Among those are the really hard aggregates.
