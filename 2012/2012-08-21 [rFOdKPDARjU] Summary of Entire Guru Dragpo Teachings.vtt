00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 Now, again, we had wonderful retreats, and beautiful, and in many ways, and I'm so grateful and

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:19.370
 thankful to you all and as well as the blessings of all great beings, great masters, great teachers

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.840
.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:29.350
 Dear blessings and dear continuing inspirations and aspirations, we had quite good practice and

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.360
 explored the teachings of the according of our capabilities.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.490
 I think we did quite good, I'm happy, and thank you very much for all that our performance and

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.040
 being part of this beautiful things.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:49.790
 Now, again, we're going to do, again, two practices we should remember our home, sweet home, the

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:58.520
 best, which is our very foundation of the practices and the motivation, and mind, that is mind.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:05.090
 We're going to think of the important mind, the strengthening, the glorifying, the beautiful

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:12.200
 motivations of vastness motivation, as well as beautiful motivations of the very inner teachings.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:18.080
 With that beautiful foundation and home sweet home, we're going to look back to the treasures,

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.440
 treasures that what we revelled and what we discussed.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:31.220
 As great master Kinti Badgiromaji often says, "Looking back to what we went through is always

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:31.720
 important."

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:39.820
 It is in the Buddha's teaching, always said, "Lion's Gate, Lion's Gate, you're looking back where

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.480
 you come from, where you are now, and what will be our vision, goal."

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:54.140
 In that context, again, I'm going to look, and I'm going to ask you to look back where we came, for

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.640
 example, two weeks ago, up to now.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.160
 And what we came, of course, is the whole teaching of the Buddha.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:08.910
 We started with the Four Renowned Session Tips, and that is the Renowned Session of the ego-cling

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:16.280
ing, Renowned Session of the attachment, and the Renowned Session of the negative, hapichi pattern.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:25.240
 That's something which is not really helping us at all. Yet, it is always as part of our package.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.800
 We carry that heavy luggage all the time.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:37.950
 Even we don't have the strength, even we don't have the capabilities to handle, yet we are dragging

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.720
 that, and we should renounce that.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:48.020
 That is the what the Renowned Session means. And all that good aspect of the Buddha highlight of

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.160
 that Renowned Session, remember that.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:59.610
 That is so important to starting off our growth and our journey adventure, and therefore, the Four

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.840
 Renowned Session is so important.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:09.400
 That's what we discussed. Within the context of the Buddha's teaching, the First Buddha's teaching,

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.240
 full noble truth,

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:19.710
 suffering truth, cause of suffering truth, and a part truth, and a cessation truth, we discussed.

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:20.920
 We went through it.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:37.480
 We went through footsteps of the mainstreams of the Buddhism, the great awakening practitioners,

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:37.520
 who follow that path and actualize their realizations, their understanding, the fulfillment is so

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.640
 rewarding.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:46.740
 That's what they got. We like to make our journey as rewarding, very rewarding, not as failures and

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.760
 disappointments.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:54.880
 Therefore, to rest our thinking of this Four Renowned Session, towards within the context of the

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.320
 full noble truth, this is what it is, and that is so important.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:07.720
 We followed the path, then we started talking about the highlight of the raffus. We discussed about

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:08.760
 the raffus.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:16.410
 And within that context, we discussed at noble paths. The greatest teacher, Buddha, highlighted at

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:17.480
 noble path.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:27.700
 When we followed at noble paths, we are in balance, perfectly in balance, not extreme, as altering

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:34.920
 this habitual, pathetic habitual pattern, carries way in the drag ass, in the ditch.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:44.910
 We follow with at noble path. That is part of light, part of peace, part of joy, and part of very

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.840
 open and uplifting encouragement.

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:55.080
 That is what the path is. Within that, we follow as taking raffus.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:02.200
 Without taking raffus, then we strengthen, not just taking only raffus, but we expand our vision

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.080
 and goal to all the sentient beings.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:13.340
 Highlight of such a beautiful attitude of the heart, opening our heart, called the Ben-Scented

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:14.360
 beings.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:22.390
 Without any discrimination, without any territories, without divide by the time and spaces, out

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:30.290
reaching, heart feeling, the great unconditional love and compassion, and the wisdom combined

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.440
 together, both each other.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:41.680
 That is what we discussed. With that beautiful context, with these beautiful conditions, beautiful

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.280
 conditions, then we developed.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:53.340
 The true visions of the Vedayana teachings, as great masters, taught, as great masters, Buddha Sh

00:05:53.340 --> 00:06:00.600
akyamuni, Guru Pymma Sambha, and Gung Chingpah, and Indian Mylung Pah, and as well as, the Satsang N

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.240
angpah, and the Tung Chio Dorje, taught.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:11.810
 And as well as, great masters, His Holiness, Guru Pymma Ching, and a great master, Kachibati Shair

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:12.200
an Vais.

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:20.360
 In their voice, in their presence, in their light, we went through. We didn't do any distorts and

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.200
 carried away, destructing in different ways.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:32.200
 We follow the main streams of the exactly straightforward path to discover our heritage.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:40.230
 With that, we went again to develop the beautiful concentriches. Concentration is the foundation of

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:41.160
 everything.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:47.330
 But at the time, we don't find all the great result, as mentioned in the teaching, as great masters

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:52.160
 achieved, great practitioners are mentioned, and they achieved.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:07:01.160
 Because we are, like us, not enough concentriches, or lack of concentriches.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:11.160
 I spoke extensively about how we should be prepared and make clear of our good concentriches.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:20.160
 We all need concentriches. You need concentriches. I need concentriches. We all need concentriches.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:29.160
 We are within as one group. We travel to it, as Sangha members. Therefore, we need concentriches.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:36.090
 We spoke about that quite extensively, eternally, exactly as the great masters highlighted and

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:37.160
 pointed out.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:44.160
 We follow that footsteps. With that understanding, then we went to the Vedayana teachings.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:51.160
 Vedayana teachings, as I said, are within the context of the two stage practices.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:08:00.680
 The creation stage practice of all this is, divine mandala, mandala of the Buddha, mandala of the

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.160
 primordial Buddha.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:12.160
 That Buddha we use as a step in the stones of the Gurutavo, the Pimaheru.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:20.150
 But actually, that mandala is our mandala, your mandala. That's what we started. How to build up

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:24.160
 the total cosmos of the divine mandala.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:30.820
 That is what we discussed. How we started. That is what the Buddha taught. That was the Muropema

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:32.160
 Samma taught.

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:38.160
 This is not mandala of something individual, of strange things from outside. We are pretending that

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:38.160
.

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:46.160
 We are the middle center and center of that column, center of that focus.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:58.800
 From there, we ignite it. We develop the magical illusion, which is the mandala, the whole

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.160
 fundamental system we develop.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:11.470
 Actually, our prison time is duality mandalas. Propose. But to remove, to transcend that duality

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:12.160
 mandala,

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:21.560
 we went through the organ inherited, the mandala, how to even work that power, that energy, that

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:22.160
 god.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:28.950
 Poem, song, and space, everything. We went through that. One very quite thorough and detailed

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:32.160
 within the context of the doctrine status.

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:39.160
 It is all display of the primordial customs, primordial awareness, the organ status.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:51.160
 Within that beauty, that richness, that openness, that is what we capture, what we behold in that.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:59.370
 And with that, then we went, went, and how to maintain, such as to continually maintain the

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:01.160
 complete state practices.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:09.760
 Complete state of the, like as a complete state of the first stage, we did dissolve of the dual

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:10.160
ities.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:14.160
 And once duality dissolve, how to continually maintain it?

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:21.160
 How to continually maintain the prison state of the, of the Dzokhi, Dzokhi status or prison status?

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:28.370
 That is what we discussed. Again, to do this, to maintain the prison status, as great masters, as D

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:30.160
zokhi and Tantaras taught.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:37.900
 Taught, we went through step by steps with beautiful concentrations, beautiful concentrations,

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:42.160
 beautiful kind of turning point of the habit patterns,

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:56.920
 and beautiful knocking out, of each of the habit points, habit point of the six ranges, with syll

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:59.160
ables, with concentric, with mantras.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:05.160
 Mantras, we went one after another. Step by steps, again, went exactly.

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:11.970
 It is, again, it is the concentric practices, it is knocking up the habit pattern or transcendent

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:13.160
 habit patterns,

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:19.780
 instantly waking up to our old and natural status, shaking up the, shaking up the deep of the sams

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:20.160
aras,

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.160
 and it is the practice of the both each others.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:29.800
 It's all that beautiful package of the practice combined together as known as continuation practice

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:30.160
.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:34.160
 That's what we discussed. We discussed.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:39.160
 With this understanding, then we want one after another, again,

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:46.440
 specifically related with our current situation of the body, current situation of the speech or

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:47.160
 voice,

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:52.160
 and current situation of our mind. Again, at the teaching method, one after another,

00:11:52.160 --> 00:12:01.440
 we went how to transcendent our physical habit pattern or notion of the clinging attachment to the

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:02.160
 habit pattern

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:09.750
 of the body and the speech and mind, and then release all that in the absolute state of the prim

00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:11.160
ordial nature states,

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:21.160
 and then relax in that state, without changing, without utter, utter, uttering, anything.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:30.160
 Relaxing that freshness, origin, openness, the natural status, which is zoki, zoki teaching.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:34.160
 That is that, and relaxing that. That is what we discussed.

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:40.160
 So therefore, what we've been discussed, we discussed the whole path of the Buddha's teachings,

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:52.160
 from the day one, the Buddha ghee, at the Sarana, dear Bhak, and that until age 81.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:56.160
 181. What did the Buddha talk?

00:12:56.160 --> 00:13:02.160
 On the open level, in the sacred level, or the mystery level, or the very higher level,

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:08.160
 that all as well by the great masters, their gracious, they continually maintain,

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:16.160
 and we will open their traangles. It is your traangles. It is not just the Buddha's traangles.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:23.160
 It is our traangles. We touched their traangles in this fall, two weeks.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:31.430
 We went through that, and that was our practice, that was our teaching, and that's what we went

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:32.160
 through.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:40.160
 So looking back, we pretty much recovered quite good whole practices.

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:49.160
 Now is your time, and our time, how are we going to apply that practices?

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:55.160
 That is what is in your mind, in my hand, in our hand.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:14:03.160
 This is not just saying something, reading things, and leave that. This will be our practices.

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:08.160
 How are we going to continue? That is, we are going to look for the future.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:15.160
 This is the future of our practice, that started from now, right now, to the future.

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:21.160
 How are we going to maintain and upkeep these practices?

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:29.160
 That is our goal, and our vision, and our plan.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:36.160
 And if you do this, again, as the great masters mentioned, and I said that before too, too.

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:44.160
 And there is five points, whether you do meditation, whether you do practices.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:52.160
 I said that already, many of you already know, the first is laziness.

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.160
 Laziness.

00:14:54.160 --> 00:15:02.160
 That whether you are going to practice the chanting, whether you are going to meditate silence.

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:08.160
 Generally, in the Vedayana teaching, chanting is meditation.

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:16.000
 Chanting is meditation. And we stay our mind with that chant, the meaning of that chant, or with

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.160
 that song.

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:20.160
 That itself is meditation.

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:25.160
 You are abiding with the way you are focused.

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:31.610
 And then, not just only abiding in one kind of scholarly stuff, you open the whole medhara in the

00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:32.160
 Vedaya.

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:37.160
 The whole medhara, which is three Vedya states.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:42.160
 Vedya, form, and Vedya, speech, and Vedya, song.

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:46.160
 That you are capturing in the subcontinues at the same time.

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:51.160
 You are activating your head within that state at the same time.

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:56.160
 So chanting is not just a distraction, chanting is the meditation.

00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:04.160
 Chanting is the practice. And we keep up that, as teachers.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:15.160
 And therefore, whether we silence meditation, or whether we are with chanting meditation.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:21.160
 The ball, the first one, number one obstacle, is laziness.

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.160
 Laziness.

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:27.160
 I'm not going to talk all the difference. I make it, you know what you make it.

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:32.160
 And you must have heard also, I mean, in the book, and you heard from others.

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:37.160
 So the laziness is the number one obstacle.

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:46.160
 The second obstacle of the practices, meditation practicing, is forgetting and struggling.

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:53.160
 Not remembering, forgetting and struggling. Even you are eager to practice.

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:57.160
 Eager to carry, to activate it might change.

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:05.160
 Forgetting and struggling is the second obstacle.

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:14.160
 And third obstacle is, now you start the practices, you start meditating.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:21.160
 But third obstacle will come during the meditation, during the practices.

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:28.160
 That is skater mode, skater. Skater, wandering thoughts.

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:36.160
 Daydreaming. A lot of daydreams coming, coming, and all those unnecessary things.

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:41.160
 Moved from the cushion, moved from the body, moved from the heart,

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:46.160
 and you are carrying some completely different directions.

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:52.160
 And you are not on that cushion. You are not on these big practices.

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:56.160
 That is called skater mode.

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:59.160
 And oh, that wandering.

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:08.160
 That is obstacles of the during, third obstacle, during the practices.

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:12.160
 And there is another obstacle during the practices.

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:18.160
 That is dullness, fogging, sleeping.

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:24.160
 Sleepy and clarity, vitality, and resistive qualities,

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:33.160
 are again robbed with that dullness, that clarity, that fogginess.

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:39.160
 That's sleeping, sleeping in an obstacle.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:49.160
 And those are the obstacles of the during practices.

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:57.160
 Then there is another obstacle, which is known as, then, you are making too much effort.

00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:05.160
 Too much effort, forceful. Make too much forceful, too much intentionally forceful

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:09.160
 during the practices, or the two practices.

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:15.160
 Again, there is another secondary obstacle.

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:20.160
 And third is not applying at all any effort.

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:26.160
 Even you see, even you know, completely can't let that happen.

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:36.160
 Those are the obstacles of our growth of the practicing of the future, from now onward.

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:39.160
 And that is what we should always put.

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:46.160
 That's what all the great masters, the practitioners, experienced, Buddha said.

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:51.160
 So remember those obstacles. And there is more details of those.

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:56.920
 I'm sure, you know, we mentioned in the books, all the different times, and you can highlight those

00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:57.160
.

00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:02.160
 But those are, and then, of course, other books, you can read.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:10.160
 Those are, I mean, principal, hindrance, and obstacles in our future practices,

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:14.160
 future practices, and the growth and the development.

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:20.160
 So therefore, remember those things, and then the practices.

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:25.160
 When you preach the practices, your practice session is finished.

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:30.160
 And how are we going to take care of them during the daytime?

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:34.160
 This is known as the post-meditation times.

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:40.160
 Post-meditation time, for us, is longer than the practice times.

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:46.160
 Any of those great practitioners, practicing is longer than the post-meditation.

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:52.160
 Those who are the different difficulties. For us, the practice is so short.

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:57.160
 Short and not practice time is very long.

00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:04.160
 Therefore, we have to stretch that energy of what you practice in a short time,

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:07.160
 stretch until the next time you practice.

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:13.160
 In a way, that this practice will be our multiple vitamins.

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:20.160
 You know, that is multiple of our tonics, that we are going to maintain that tonic,

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:25.160
 tonic all the way to the next step that you start the practices.

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:32.160
 To upkeep that, how we do? That is known as mindfulness.

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:38.160
 Of course, again, this mindfulness, all that, always necessary, always important.

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:45.160
 But mindfulness, alertness, and caution, coincidence.

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:54.160
 These three are always important, and particularly during we are out of the practices.

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:57.160
 This. And what it will do? It will do.

00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:02.160
 It will come back to our own natural status.

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:08.160
 It will remind us. They will continually see assistance for us,

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:12.160
 which supports that we cannot lose control.

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:17.160
 We have not lost our string of wheels, string of wheels.

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:25.160
 It will bring back us to the trick, trap, trap, and the wrong.

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:31.160
 Therefore, mindfulness, alertness, consciousness is always important.

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:36.160
 That means also, that means you are going to remember of the practice and teachings.

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:40.160
 Remember the teachings. Remember the practices.

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:47.160
 Remember of the great master's legacy, their visions, their advice.

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:52.160
 All that will bring, as it needed, as is required,

00:22:52.160 --> 00:23:00.160
 record and bring up available that immediately, so that we won't lost our string of wheels.

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:03.160
 String of wheels.

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:08.160
 And then, perceiving all this together, as with that, and then you have that.

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:14.160
 Seeing all this as magical, dream, miracle.

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:19.160
 And then performing activity that which is benefitting to others, to yourself.

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:27.160
 With joy, with respect, with appreciation, with calm, with peace, and move forward.

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:34.160
 And always encourage ourself, ourself, and looking back to our activities

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:39.160
 and see, "Oh, I did good. How I am going to do better in life."

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:44.160
 Every time, set up the compromising of the joy, appreciation,

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:47.160
 some of the all good activities that we perform.

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:51.160
 And we see some, that out of that good activities,

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:57.160
 with respect, courage, and commitment, that next time, I won't repeat.

00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:00.160
 May the blessings of the Buddha in the European Assembly, great masters,

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:05.160
 so that I will continue to stay on the right, rightness status,

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:09.160
 so that I won't make too many mistakes.

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:13.160
 Mistakes and hindrance, we can make. We have the ignorance.

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:15.160
 It's not something unusual that is happening.

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:19.160
 But we can acknowledge it and try to change.

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:22.160
 Again, that is our responsibility.

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:25.160
 That is the identity of the practitioners.

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:30.160
 Not just a kind of like, ignore, ignore, and then again.

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:38.160
 Always that's not what is known as purification, forgiveness, excuse.

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:40.160
 And use those.

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:45.160
 And that will to be practiced in such a way as subtle practices, so forth.

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:49.160
 It doesn't purify, forgive, let it go.

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:52.160
 We're not going to keep that shadow and that stain, all that.

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:58.160
 But use as experience, use as knowledge.

00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:00.160
 Then continue to move forward.

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:04.160
 That is what is known as the guru of beautiful activities.

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:08.160
 Activities of the body, activities of the speech, activities of the mind.

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:11.160
 And those are now the ten virtuous activities,

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:18.160
 but great master, Vasudvendu told, and great also Bodhisattva.

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:22.160
 Our Lakshvara told, I mentioned before, but it's all good activities.

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:29.160
 Do good things that related with you, that reflecting your love and joy in the devotions.

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:33.160
 And I said, other day I mentioned also, great master Karmachamma said,

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:38.160
 do sakramath, do pashtak, do service to the others that benefit,

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:41.160
 and help to those who are sick, sick persons.

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:49.160
 If you can help, help to them, accord your capabilities, accord readiness, and help them.

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:55.160
 And those all known as virtuous activities of upward practices,

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:57.160
 all the false meditation practices.

00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:01.160
 So those are what is our future plans.

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:03.160
 Those are our future activities.

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:07.160
 And if we maintain that, then we're keeping good practices.

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:09.160
 And again, I'm going to highlight that.

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:12.160
 With this understanding, every time you practice,

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:16.160
 as great master Karmachamma said, and can keep Karmachamma,

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:18.160
 you often take that.

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:22.160
 That is not just every very master said in his mind.

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:26.160
 First, it's the most important is poor renunciation,

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:29.160
 and bodhicata, rafu, and bodhicata.

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:31.160
 Those are the foundations.

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:34.160
 Second is that with that foundation, you're going to practice.

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:38.160
 Practice and meditate, that practice.

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:43.160
 At the end, then do the dedication, aspiration and dedication plays.

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:47.160
 Those are the three noble ones.

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:52.160
 The first noble, middle noble, and ending noble.

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:56.160
 If we keep all with that practice, what I said already,

00:26:56.160 --> 00:27:04.160
 all that comes perfectly as beautiful practice in the following part of this great master's.

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:05.160
 A great teacher.

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:10.160
 And that is my brief talk and reminding of the teaching.

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:14.160
 And now we're going to do that practice as we do always.

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:17.160
 And thank you everyone again. Thank you.
