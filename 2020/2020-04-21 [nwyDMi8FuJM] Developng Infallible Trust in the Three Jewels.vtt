00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.140
 Again, I'd like to say good afternoon and welcome everyone. Thank you very much. Again, we continue

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:24.180
 to go on the teaching of the greatest teachers of the Buddha Satyamali, but regularly taught

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:31.860
 by Gavri Dudjo Rinpoche. And we are going to continue on this teaching. And now on that,

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:42.260
 at the beginning, line 6, explaining how the importance of contracting to the Three Jewels

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:51.140
 by trusting and asking if you do that, then the result will be the unpalleable. Those are

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:59.620
 the statements or the instructions that His Holiness Dudjo Rinpoche made, or asked that.

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:06.980
 So everyone still has these teachings on the Three Jewels. Three Jewels of that. And today,

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:14.020
 I'm going to conclude with that. Yesterday, I mentioned generally kind of Three Jewels

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:21.060
 of the General Buddhism of the Buddha Dhammasanga. And particularly also in Vedayana teaching,

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:28.900
 there's slightly different terminologies, such as Guru, Yedam, or the deities and the

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:40.020
 Dakini's. And then of course, I mentioned about the chairs, wind, and the essence, the element

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:47.460
 of the body. And then I also mentioned the essence of the nature, the essence of the

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:54.260
 emptiness and nature of the mind, essence of the clarity and nature of the mind, and the

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:03.780
 essence of the display of the nature of the mind. I mentioned those are also like Three Jewels or

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:13.220
 the Three Gaias or the Three Roots and all that. Today, I'd just like to highlight who is,

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:22.660
 of course, the Buddha Dhammasanga we know, who is, who are the Guru. What is a Guru? Guru.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:31.700
 So everything of that way. And Guru is generally Sanskrit Guru, and the Tibetan is translated as

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:41.220
 lama, in English, we translate or people translate as teachers. So that kids who are the teachers,

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:48.420
 and the teachers are Buddha Shakyamuni. And Guru Pemmasambhava are the teachers.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:54.260
 Particularly when we are connected to the very other teaching, open, in the teaching, open,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:01.380
 said that see Guru Pemmasambhava as our teachers, even they have, we have many different

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.100
 connections

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:09.300
 of the teachers in this lifetime, but we can bring all those teachers as within the

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:17.620
 part of the Guru Pemmasambhava. So we do it. And that means Buddha Shakyamuni and all the teachers

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:25.940
 are become as Guru Pemmasambhava. And Guru Pemmasambhava, one who brought the Redi Vaidyana

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:34.180
 teaching to Tibet, or he was the instrumental to bring the Vaidyana teaching, we are practicing

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:42.020
 Vaidyana teachings. Teaching, so therefore, and Buddha Shakyamuni always emphasized that

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:50.420
 teacher is important. Teachers are so important. And for that reason, the Buddha's teaching,

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:57.940
 you know what I said, teachers are the Buddha, teachers are the Dharma, teachers are the Sangha,

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:06.890
 and teachers are all in body mode of the pilates. But this sign that teaches all we see as Guru Pem

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:07.540
masambhava.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:16.100
 So Guru Pemmasambhava is leading example of the teachers. Guru Pemmasambhava is also according,

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:23.540
 generally there is two teachers, we open, I said, when you say, specifically when he's talking,

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.940
 or specifically we go with more kind of practical levels, there's two senses.

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:37.780
 Devotion and seeing the teacher as Buddhas, or teachers are really Buddhas. In that way,

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:46.580
 Guru Pemmasambhava is really Buddha, absolutely Buddha. And as well as then devotional level,

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:55.380
 Guru Pemmasambhava is Buddha. So both devotional level and reality level, Guru Pemmasambhava is

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:04.030
 Buddha. And therefore, all teachers are within the umbrella of the Guru Pemmasambhava. Those are

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.660
 all

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:12.350
 suggested in the teachings, in the new millenniums. So I'm just highlighting that. Then, in that

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.820
 way,

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:21.860
 who are the Yidams. The Yidams, generally the Yidam is very old and from Sanskrit is used

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:31.700
 with Devak, Guru Devak. But Devak is translated, translated in two different ways. One is called

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:40.340
 and the other is Yidam. Yidam, in this case, Yidam means like mind. Dham means supreme,

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:51.300
 supreme or holy. So holy to the heart or supreme to the heart. So that means half condition of the

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:58.580
 practices. That means whose heart connection practice. For example, like who is the Yidams,

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:04.980
 now I will say, for example, Yidam can be like Vaidya Kalyas, Vaidya Satvas,

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:15.060
 Ojaya Giravas, Yaman Thakas. This time it depends. All the Amitamas, Rena Sabavas, all that can be,

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:25.860
 they are all Yidams. Yidams. And they are the supreme or the holy or the noble of the heart.

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:32.180
 Whose supreme or the noble of the heart? For example, Gurbel Masambhava is totally

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:39.620
 enlightening, as we just mentioned to you. Any of you all know that. However, on a relative level,

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:46.980
 Gurbel Masambhava practices on the Vaidya Kalya. So it's become his personal duty,

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:53.780
 the Vaidya Kalya become. It's like supreme heart to the Gurbel Masambhava anyway. So therefore,

00:06:53.780 --> 00:07:01.140
 when he came to Tibet, also he gave many teachings on the Vaidya Kalyas and as well as also

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:08.580
 at Herukas, so forth. So that's the really, really meaning of the Yidam. Personal connection,

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:14.980
 something that we are truly connected, is a personal commitment into the heart center.

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:22.660
 And so that is Yidams really. But also, this Vaidya Sattva, Vaidya Kalya can be also guru too.

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:35.060
 As I said yesterday, guru, Yidam can be guru, Yidam can be yidam, and Yidam can be nakinis too.

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:41.540
 So it's not something that is kind of completely strike the rules and these things. So that way,

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:50.100
 so that is really kind of like identifications of Yidams. And then talk about the nakinis.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:58.260
 Who are the nakinis? Dakinis generally, again in Sanskrit word, it is translated into Tibet

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:08.580
 as palm, row, ma. Palm, row, ma, three words. And what that means? Palm is space,

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:18.900
 row means goal, goal, goal. And ma means goal, goal. So ma is also indicative of the fema,

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:27.940
 fema. So the space of goal, femas. Of space of goal, femas. Yeah, I think that's it.

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:33.940
 But then they translate it also, sky dancers or sky goals, walker of the skies.

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:40.180
 But what that actually really means, that is again in the nimma teaching,

00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:46.980
 or in the teaching, clearly measured on the space of the loving kindness, the compassion,

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:56.900
 or space of the wisdom and the compassion, freely walking, freely travels. Then that's what the

00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:03.380
 dakinis. Dakinis are totally enlightened beings of the pure bullets. So they are

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:11.380
 completely actualized of the realization of great compassion and the wisdom.

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:18.900
 All wisdom of great emptiness and the compassion of the skillful beings completely combined has

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:25.940
 really enlightened the ultimate state. Therefore, their embodiment of compassion and wisdom,

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:34.500
 and for that reason, they are the master of these two matters, skillful beings and wisdom,

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:41.300
 and therefore, they are known as dakinis. Dakinis. So who are the examples of dakinis,

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:50.980
 such as wisdom, dakini, ishin, choyams, taras, Veda yoginis, Veda varahis, Veda yoginis,

00:09:50.980 --> 00:10:00.740
 or all the female bullets. Those are basically known as dakinis. And again, dakini can be yetom,

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:08.740
 dakini can be lama, or dakini can be guru, dakini can be yetom, or the deity, dakini can be as

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:16.340
 dakinis to you. So that way, I mean, it's not something completely like the kind of structurally

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:25.060
 and divided in identifications, but it's all in body. Body is everything. The reality, guru, deva,

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:34.610
 dakini, onguru, yetom, dakinis, all are enlightened beings, all the bullets. And that is what it

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:35.060
 really

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:41.700
 is. And so that is really the kind of that has been reactivating, re-clarifications,

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:49.780
 or re-identifications of the guru, deva, dakini, or the three roots. Now, again, I say one more

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:57.300
 thing about the guru, Buddha, dharmasants. And Buddha is a simple way to know, Buddha is the

00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:04.500
 one who gives the teachings. So that is Buddha Shakyamali in this world. And then what is Gurubham

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:05.140
masan?

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:13.620
 Gurubhammasan is also known as the Buddha of the Vaidyana teachings. And Buddha Shakyamali,

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:21.300
 when he came in this world, 5600 years ago, and when he gave the teaching, on the common level,

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:30.900
 he gave the teachings on the basic Buddhist school, and the sutramahayanas, that basic Buddhist

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:38.580
 schools. Really, that is very popular. Then, when Buddha Shakyamali gave the Vaidyana teachings,

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:46.420
 that depends with many of the great masters interpreting. But Buddha Ghee, well, he was in

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:55.620
 India in that 81 years that he said, according to the common conceptual level, he said about 81

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:56.020
 years

00:11:56.020 --> 00:12:03.380
 in India and gave the teaching. During that time, he gave the teachings of the Vaidyana teachings.

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:12.980
 Where he gave that teachings, not in the common world of the duality, he gave those teachings

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:22.100
 on the celestial world or, if you will use, the Akanishad, or women. Those different areas,

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:30.900
 in the Duhida heavens, pick up the Malaya mountain, or Malayas, or Beno of the Oceans,

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:36.980
 all the different areas. But according to the Vaidyana teachings, it's not just he gave the

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:44.180
 teachings as we used to look at India exactly that time. But he gave that teachings in another

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:51.860
 level, another dimensional level, that he gave the Vaidyana teachings. Well, he was in India

00:12:51.860 --> 00:13:03.140
 two thousand six hundred years ago. He gave the teachings. So then, right before Buddha Shakyamali

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:12.500
 entered Mahapari Narvanas, and some students asked to Buddha Shakyamali, all great teachers,

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:18.020
 now you're entering in Mahapari Narvanas, you're leaving this wall. But you give

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:28.900
 causal teachings so many times, but you did not explain or talk as resortyana teaching.

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:36.100
 That means that resort, we're talking about resort or cause, what you are both are using

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:43.300
 as an object or goal is to get enlightenment, Buddhahood. Buddhahood, very quickly, fast,

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:51.780
 positive. So that is like causal yana means one is being caused to bring enlightenment as

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:59.940
 causing a result, result as enlightenment, resort yana. The result is so fast, within the single

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:05.060
 lifetime, if you have the capability and opportunity and practice the accordion and

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:12.580
 struggle, you can get a result within a short period of time. Therefore, it is the name

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:22.980
 of resort yanas, getting quickly enlightenment. So these students asked great master, you give

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:34.100
 variety teachings on the causal yanas, but you did not explain openly about the resort yanas.

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:42.260
 And Buddha said, I give the teaching of the causal yana, those who are ready to receive

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:49.620
 their teaching or who are connected, but resort yana will come soon after my Mahabharic Naranas.

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:59.300
 That is what Buddha said. As Buddha said, and then all the Vedayana teachings are starting

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:07.220
 appearing 27 years after or 28 years after Buddha checked him on his Mahabharic Narana.

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:15.300
 And then even before that, Gurbel Masamma was appeared right in the middle of the lotus.

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:23.700
 Miraculously, as a born, at eight years after Buddha checked him on his Mahabharic Narana,

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:32.900
 he appeared. And as Buddha predicted, he will come back as Gurbel Masamma. And then he the one

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:39.140
 who also really more actively reversed the Vedayana teaching that which already was a

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:46.900
 guild on the celestial world and a world that may well go to this world and particularly in Tibet.

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:56.260
 Tibet. So therefore, Gurbel Masamma is also considered as master of the Vedayana teaching,

00:15:56.900 --> 00:16:05.140
 Vedayana teaching. So therefore, these two Buddhas are or the Buddha kept many,

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:11.380
 one who taught the teaching and that is the Buddha. And then the teachings already we make

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:17.780
 and all that and the teachings are all those variety of teachings. Sartre teaching and/or

00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:24.980
 kasayana teaching and Vedayana teaching, all those are the teachings. Now, so that means

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:31.860
 Buddha Dharma. And what is the Sangha now, actually? And as he said, yes, two days ago,

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:42.020
 Sangha means they're devoted to the virtues. Virtues. But also same time, what Sangha does,

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:50.580
 what Sangha has realizations. Sangha has a realization of seeing true nature according

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:57.220
 there. I mean, whatever the degree they are, seeing some true naturals and also the same time,

00:16:57.220 --> 00:17:04.660
 removed some really of the obscurations, habit patterns or a process of the child movement,

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:11.620
 obscurations and habit patterns. Those are simple to tell of the meaning of the Sangha.

00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:19.540
 But what is there? Another beside role of the Sangha member is known as older of the teachings.

00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:27.620
 One who hold the teachings. Buddha gave the teaching. So Buddha is the one who gave the teaching.

00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:33.060
 Then teaching is here. But now teaching is here. But who hold the teaching?

00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:43.460
 Who maintain the teaching? This is Sangha members. Buddha came 2600 years ago.

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:50.900
 Gurba Masambha came to Tibet in 8 centuries. And in between there is so many great Masambhas came.

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:56.980
 But who really hold the teachings from the time the Buddha entered Mahaprabhu Nirmala until now?

00:17:56.980 --> 00:18:04.980
 It's all the Sangha members. Many people, many of the individual things, holders of teaching

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:13.140
 is kind of only selected group or few groups, few kind of teachers, particularly kind of Sanjay,

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:19.140
 we think that. It's true. They are the holder of the teachings. But not just the thing or the few

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:27.140
 teachers. Everyone, the Sangha member, who is a very practicing Dharma, who are devoted to them,

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:37.060
 to the rituals, means who are devoted to the teaching. They are the holder of the Sangha members.

00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:46.900
 So that means we all have all have the holder of the teachings. We all have the responsibilities

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:57.940
 of the two upheld teachings. It is authenticness and godliness. And godliness. As it is preserved

00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:06.260
 like that way. What as exotic, authentic, praise, powerful, blessed folk, they kept the Sangha

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:07.140
 members

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:16.020
 from the time Buddha gave the teaching until now. In which manner they uphold, then both

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:24.260
 scripture and the realization levels. They hold healing of that. Both ways, two ways.

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:32.020
 So that means a similar way. Sangha held up the teachings through the intellectual ways

00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:37.860
 and the same time through the practice. And the practice and the intellectuals are combined

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:46.100
 together. Starting with the scripture with understanding, realization. I held together

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:57.940
 to their goal of heart and maintained with love, joy, respect. That's what they practice and that's

00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:05.540
 what they share to the others. That is continuing. So light of the teaching, light of Dharma,

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:12.020
 the Buddha light up there. The light is continually carried by all the Sangha members.

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:21.380
 Whether big ways, whether small ways, whether medium ways. But everyone held up that light.

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:28.100
 This is not just the whole helping of the light, but they illuminated themselves according their

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:36.340
 capabilities. And they also passed their light to the others and smiled and carried on the others.

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:43.060
 So that is really known as the Buddha meaning of the Sangha members. So therefore,

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:51.940
 we all are holder of the teachings. Teachings, Buddha, that we therefore, we are all part of the

00:20:51.940 --> 00:21:02.010
 three jewels. Three jewels, Buddha, Dharma, Sangha. And therefore, keeping up, it is identity,

00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:02.580
 quality,

00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:10.660
 every way, as much as we can do with joy, with devotion, with inspirations, with prayers,

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:21.220
 keep up identity. And that is known as practicing Dharma, practicing the identity of the spiritual

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:29.940
 lineage and helping up the life of love and compassion, kindness to all living beings

00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:36.740
 without any discriminations. And that is the really beautiful, beautiful principles.

00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:46.100
 And that is what it is. So that is really about the Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, about three jewels,

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:53.940
 what we've been talking about. Now we talk about what his own message is. Trust us. Trust us.

00:21:54.900 --> 00:22:02.660
 This is generally what is in the teaching, you say, what is the cause of taking refuge.

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:10.740
 In great master, Bhumala Mathara said in the teaching, his first teaching that he gave in

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:19.620
 Tibet, Bhumala Mathara, as you all know, I think you, yeah, you all know, he was one of the great

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:27.940
 masters in the Buddhist Histories. He was the one of the first among three of them. He is the

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:35.140
 first great teacher of the Dzogki teacher, great Dzogki teacher who came to Tibet, who gave the

00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:42.980
 teaching, Dzogki teaching in Tibet, along with all the other teachings. So in the Tibetan Buddhist

00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:50.260
 Histories, the New Masters Histories said there's two great masters who wore the Dzogki teaching

00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:58.260
 in Tibet. First time in the eighth century, it was Guru Pima Sambabar, Bhumala Mathara,

00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:12.820
 and the great Dzogki teacher, the Dzogki teacher in Tibet. From that

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:19.460
 all these Dzogki teachings, what we have now, came transmitted from them. Of course, all literally

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:26.180
 taught by the Buddha, Chaturbuni in the form of Buddha Sambabar, but that's in Tibet. These are

00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:33.800
 three great masters who ignited these teachings. So this, of course, when he came to the great

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:34.420
 master,

00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:41.140
 Bhumala Mathara, when he came first time in Tibet in the eighth century by invitation of

00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:49.460
 King Chaso Depli, and somehow King Chaso Depli had a little suspicious of the Bhumala Mathara's

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:56.180
 effectiveness of his calling of the teacher, be as teacher, as Buddhist teacher, because he got

00:23:56.180 --> 00:24:06.820
 cylinders or some news, mixed news that he might be as non-Buddhist teacher, non-Buddhist teacher.

00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:13.780
 So he didn't really feel immediately comfortable with the contract to receive the teachings from

00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:20.340
 great master Bhumala Mathara's immediately. Even though he invited, even though he made big effort

00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:29.140
 to invite him to come to Bhumala Mathara in Tibet, and Bhumala Mathara came already in the Tibet

00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:40.420
 capital, but he's not meeting. So therefore, then Bhumala Mathara wrote very condensed, beautiful

00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:48.020
 instructions of how to take refuge in the Buddha Dhamma Sangha. And so this is the very known

00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:57.140
 teachings on the refuge. So there, what great master Bhumala Mathara said, cause of taking refuge

00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:18.100
 is devotion of faith. F-A-T-H. I think F-A-I-T-H. Faith. That's true. Faith. Faith for the devotion

00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:31.700
 and somebody of the like, kind of like, faith. F-E-A-R. Faith. These true are the like cause

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:45.620
 of the refuge. Then great master Jimi Longba added, kind of activated, two more, two more. And that

00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:45.860
 is,

00:25:47.380 --> 00:26:02.980
 is that, and maybe Jimi Longba mentioned it in these ways, this way to bring the cause of devotion,

00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:13.140
 sorry, cause of devotion or cause of faith. Faith. F-A-I-T-H. Cause of faith. They

00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:24.020
 reminded the four different ways we have the cause of the faith or the devotion. First one is

00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:35.780
 contact with the spiritual friend and accompanying a companion or kind of being

00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:44.740
 premature with the spiritual friend. That second, third is, is, and reading the books about the

00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:53.940
 Buddha, Dharma, Sangha or the Buddha and about the Dharma and then have the kind of tired and bold

00:26:53.940 --> 00:27:04.820
 with samsara. So those are the four cause to develop the faith. Faith or the devotion.

00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:16.100
 First again, contacting with the spiritual friend or as teacher maybe and accompanying,

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:27.540
 complaining as spiritual friend. Second, third, reading books on the Dharma or about the Buddha

00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:40.340
 or about the Dharma, Sangha. Paul is tired or the bold with the samsara. Paul, that this four cause

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:50.820
 will develop the devotions or the pain. That's what really great master Jimi Longba mentioned.

00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:59.780
 So therefore, that no matter whatever it is, faith is important. Faith is important

00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:08.900
 and devotion or faith is important. And then what great master, Momamakar said, faith. F-E-E-R.

00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:17.060
 That faith is again, mass grade, mass grade, Jimi Longba mentioned three different faiths.

00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:24.900
 Faith. That means also maybe I can translate it, that faith as tired and bold, bold.

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:33.940
 So tired, bold with the general samsara situations. And then that's the first one. Second,

00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:43.300
 tired and bold with our own self-greeting, self-important. Self-important all the time.

00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:53.620
 Kind of always thinking of this, our self. Tired and bold. And the third one. Tired and bold

00:28:53.620 --> 00:29:03.540
 by these so many conceptions, so many anxieties, so many notions. One apron that this endless

00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:03.860
 coming.

00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:13.380
 I'm now tired and bold and sick of this all the time. There's no ending. So for that reason,

00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:24.500
 those are known as fears become uncomfortable with this. Uncomfortable with this. Therefore,

00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:34.100
 then I'm going to take refuge, refuge. So that means that that's the word we develop. We develop

00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:41.300
 the devotion or the path. Then the path is so important. What the great master Pappaluruma said,

00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:50.420
 fed or the debha in it is called debha. So I'm translating it as a fed or the devotion.

00:29:50.420 --> 00:30:02.420
 Devotion. Fed is a doll of old enlightenment. That is the Pappaluruma said. And that is also

00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:14.420
 what I said that too. Droll is fed is a doll of liberations. And so this is fed is so important.

00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:23.860
 And for that reason, great master Natarjuna said in his teachings and known as the garland of the

00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:33.940
 jewel, garland of the jewel, he said. And because you are in the spiritual, because your devotion

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:43.460
 or your fed, you are in the spiritual. You are with the spiritual. Because of your wisdom,

00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:52.420
 you rely on the true natures. Among this now, the fed and the wisdom which is important. He said,

00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:59.140
 wisdom is more important, wisdom is important. But we call the wisdom fed is important.

00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:09.780
 To have the wisdom, you have to have fed first. So therefore, Natarjuna said, at the very beginning

00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:09.780
,

00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:16.660
 fed or the devotion is so important, even igniting our wisdom, even though wisdom is so important.

00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:24.580
 So for those, I mean, this is what those great master said. But it is not just only what the

00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:33.620
 master said. Fed is so important. Devotion is so important. We talk later too in the teaching,

00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:38.980
 mentioned in the European Union, we teach in talking that song in here. Clearly that,

00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:47.300
 but we talk that. So this devotion is, if we say devotion or the fed, how many there that?

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:54.900
 Devotion is in the Buddha teaching, kind of like intensified in these three ways.

00:31:54.900 --> 00:32:06.260
 Interested devotion or the fed. Interested, maybe I just won't use fed. F-A-T-F, fed.

00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:18.980
 So interested fed. Desiring fed. Trusty fed. So those are three pets. But the great master

00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:23.220
 in Yiminglongba again added another one. I mean, this is not just Yiminglongba adding,

00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:29.460
 but he's intensified as a coded teaching of the Buddha Shakyamuni. Inperioral fed,

00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:42.900
 tortoise, imperium or unshakable fed. So, interesting fed, desirable fed and trusty fed

00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:55.780
 and unshakable fed. Those are known as the fed. Interested fed is when you read the books

00:32:55.780 --> 00:33:00.820
 or when you contract with a spiritual friend, when you're a confident spiritual

00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:07.540
 or company or kind of going with them or alone associated with spiritual friends. Or when you

00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:12.340
 are kind of let's say there's so many chaos things, difficulty in some society in the world, one up

00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:18.340
 another, all that you kind of start that be interested more, some other meaning of the lives

00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:24.980
 in the spiritual or kind of some deeper meaning of these lives. That is known as

00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:32.340
 interest fed. That is the beginning of the dome of life, according to the Buddha said. That is.

00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:40.020
 Because then, now you like to explore more about that, like to know, read more or like to kind of

00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:45.220
 contract with a more spiritual friend or contract with a company more spiritual friend,

00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:50.100
 encouraging, kind of put that and going more kind of understand, understand. And then you really

00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:50.340
 now

00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:58.180
 become more, you feel more desired. Oh, I like to be, I like to be part of this. I like to explore,

00:33:58.180 --> 00:34:04.580
 and I like to know more that. So then you really kind of like, read more deeper. So that is known

00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:12.660
 as desirable fed. Because of that, then you explore more and more. Now you see more kind of

00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:19.140
 important value and benefit of all that things, that more and more it makes sense, then it becomes

00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:25.540
 the trust. So that's what the Dhindjal Muni said, trust. That is very, very important.

00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:32.420
 That is really trust. Now you trust, that is really true. Like that. And I'm trusting,

00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:40.660
 I like trusting, I like to explore, I've explored meaning of that, call it this, it's true. I now

00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:54.100
 trust this. And with that, then the last one is unshakable or unpayable. Trust or pay. Trusting

00:34:54.100 --> 00:35:01.060
 that now become so strong. So develop, no matter what your situation of circumstance that happened,

00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:08.500
 you never like to separate it. Never like to give up that. You like to explore and stay with this.

00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:19.460
 That is then strongest fed or the devotions that individualists can develop. And with that,

00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:26.500
 we have that, then the realization is on the way. Development is on the way. And there is

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:34.100
 so many beautiful stories of the trusty or unshakable devotions. So many stories that you can

00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:41.060
 read in the books, really. So many of those masters or the great beings are so unshakable

00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:46.420
 to the Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, to their practice and principle kept no matter whatever externally

00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:51.860
 things happen in samsara, khandra, like this and that things happening. But they kept so strong in

00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:57.700
 heart and mind and they developed, they maintained their practice in the meditation and get the

00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:04.420
 realization and to perform what they want and go on that. So that is what is really known as

00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:14.260
 unshakable devotions. So the cause of ruffled is devotions. And the cause of the devotion or the

00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:21.380
 pain is that as great master Gimli Lama measured those cause. They are the cause of the condition

00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:31.070
 to aspire devotions, then develop the devotion or the pain. And of course, the pain and the

00:36:31.070 --> 00:36:31.700
 devotion

00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:43.220
 both are the English language, but I thought pain is kind of like just trust and confidence,

00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:50.180
 confidence. And then devotion is now, you recognize, you see the quality and the beauty and

00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:58.420
 importance. And I will not just only trust, but you are enjoying, you are appreciating, you feel

00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:07.140
 in a soul connected with calm and peaceful. So this kind of more intensified or more another level,

00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:14.340
 deeper level of the mental status combined with the quality of the joy and appreciation and kind of

00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:20.820
 calm and peaceful and feel the preciousness of that. And that is I think devotion and debate

00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:29.700
 also has two words, debah and mughu. So debah is like pain and mughu is like devotion. And the

00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:37.700
 devotion is so important in the teaching set. Once you have pain and then devotion, when it comes,

00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:45.140
 that richness feeling, warmth feeling, that calm and peaceful feeling, and that really then

00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:54.100
 activated so beautifully, so faster, all the performance. And that is my brief talk today,

00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:59.620
 and thank you very much everyone again for participating and coming, and thank you everyone.
