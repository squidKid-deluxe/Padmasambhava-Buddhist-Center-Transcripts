NOTE     "synopsis": "Great Terton First Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo\nby Ven. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche\n\nJamyang Khyentse Wangpo [\u2019jam dbyangs mkhyen brtse\u2019i dbang po, 1820-1892]. Often referred to as the First Khyentse, Pema O\u0308sal Do-ngak Lingpa, and O\u0308sal Trulpe Dorje, Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo was an emanation of King Trisong Deutsen, Chetsun Senge Wangchuk, and Vimalamitra, among others, in addition to being a great terto\u0308n and scholar. He co-founded the Ri-me ecumenical movement along with the First Kongtrul, and was a great master of all the Buddhist schools of Tibet. Due to his tremendous realization, the First Khyentse was able to recover many lineages that had been lost over time, and was therefore the father of the nineteenth century Tibetan Renaissance, the lord of the \u201cseven entrusted transmissions\u201d [bka\u2019 bab bdun ldan]. Altogether these include: (1) the oral tradition of kama [bka\u2019 ma], the rare oral teachings from all schools of Tibetan Buddhism; (2) earth terma [sa gter]; (3) rediscovered terma [yang gter], which were previously discovered and revealed again; (4) mind terma [dgongs gter] that spontaneously appeared in the mindstream of Lord Khyentse; (5) recollected teachings [rjes dran], or teachings remembered from former lifetimes; (6) pure visions received from the Three Roots [dag snang]; and (7) the hearing or \u201cwhispered\u201d lineage [snyan brgyud], pith instructions given by an enlightened being or qualified teacher.\n\nAs His Holiness Dudjom Rinpoche explains,\n\nKhyentse Rinpoche had immeasurable faith and devotion towards each of these systems, of which the past traditions have been preserved in unbroken lineages. Therefore, scorning physical fatigue, and with fervent perseverance, he received in full, and without error, all their sequences of maturation and liberation from tutors connected with the sources of each tradition. By reflecting upon them he cleared his doubts; and while experientially cultivating them through meditation he received the blessings of the three secrets and the instructions of close lineages, both in reality and during various visions and dreams, from the learned and accomplished masters of India and Tibet, the peaceful and wrathful meditational deities and conquerors, and the host of d\u0323a\u0304kini\u0304s of the three abodes. In these and other ways he had limitless pure visions at each and every instant.\n\nBecause he was a master of the seven types of entrusted transmission and a peerless terto\u0308n who saved many lineages from extinction, always practicing without even the slightest trace of sectarian bias, Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo is universally regarded and revered as an exceptional master and lineage holder of all the schools of Tibetan Buddhism.\n\nAgain, H.H. Dudjom Rinpoche explains,\n\nDuring the present day there is no one, high or low, with whom he might be compared...because Khyentse Rinpoche had acquired firmness in the twofold precious enlightened attitude, and especially, because he was endowed with the vast power of pure vision and devotion toward all the philosophical systems, and was otherwise totally without bias and bigotry, his students were countless. They included all the well-known holders of the teaching, and great individuals among the Sakyapa, Kagyu\u0308pa, Nyingmapa, and Gelukpa, as well as spiritual benefactors, practitioners of retreat, poor mendicants, and adherents of the Yungdrung Po\u0308n tradition, without partiality...it was as if there was no one who did not obtain, in accord with his or her devotion, a connection [with the master], whether through the gift of the doctrine, the removal of misfortune, empowerment, or blessing. Free from the fetters of the eight worldly concerns, Khyentse Rinpoche eradicated the roots of such human behaviour as saving face and hope and fear, whether found in persons of high or low status. Thus, his career was that of a king among those who had renounced worldly activity and the cares of this life.\n\nExcerpted from Ceaseless Echoes of the Great Silence: A Commentary on the Heart Sutra Prajnaparamita\nwww.padmasambhava.org/chiso/books-by-khenpo-rinpoches/ceaseless-echoes-of-the-great-silence\n\n2018 PSL Shedra on the Terma Lineage\nAugust 29, 2018\nPadma Samye Ling\n\nwww.padmasambhava.org",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.940
 Khyentse Wangpo is one of the great Tibetan students. Khyentse Wangpo was born in 1820,

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:24.350
 in East Tibet. His father was known as 'Arokraksa' family, family or the secretary of the king of

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:24.780
 Delhi,

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:37.700
 Delgi Rekhimwadya. His mother's name is Sosa Sonansu, and he was born in the 1820s.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:50.020
 The moment he was born and that moment that six of Mahakala and Ekachadis are always with him,

00:00:50.020 --> 00:01:00.980
 he was always at that feeling. The moment he began to speak him, he was so smart. He was so smart,

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:13.060
 immediately he understood everything. So he is a genius. And every book or read something in it,

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:22.220
 one time he read and he completely understood the meaning and word of memorization. At age 21,

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:37.180
 then he ordered in the medallic monastery as fully ordered monks. So he was one of the great

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.540
 masters.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.780
 Then he received so many teaching from so many masters, one after another. And the moment he

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:43.340
 received,

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:50.340
 he understood everything. He had what is called a photograph of memories, memories, everything.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:02:00.820
 So in the teachings, he contracted with over 150 masters. And where he learned the language,

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:08.500
 that means grandmas or the Muslim tongue is indicating language means Sanskrit. And then as well as

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:19.540
 geometry and the medicines and the logic and or reasoning that he learned. And then all the Buddha

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.580
's

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:27.340
 teachings such as Vinaya, Abhidhana, Sutra, Mademaka, Pandya Paramata, all that he learned,

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:36.140
 he just become so masters. And so therefore, at the same time, he says, what he learned immediately

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.140
,

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.820
 he really understood that. And also he put that into the practices, according to the teaching,

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:46.700
 that he put practice, so not just to let that. And when he practiced that and when he received the

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:53.580
 teaching, he was also so devoted. So devoted. He don't have any discrimination, anything,

00:02:53.580 --> 00:03:00.620
 any schools of the Buddhism, everything. And even born religions, he respect, he received the

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:09.020
 teachings. So he become therefore, he become the master of all, all the schools of Buddhism. So in

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:16.180
 what he received, he received, really here, this is I'm reading that his own like written book,

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:23.300
 and it is it as new makama in 10 months, and it is it all the teachings of the kadam, new kadam,

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:29.700
 and old kadam. New kadam means, old kadam means that kadam schools start from the atishas, that

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:37.260
 teaching, and new means from the tungkabas, great tungkabas. And then from Sathya schools, and from

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:44.860
 kadams, and kadams, that means that particularly, kind of particular lineage of the kadams. And

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:45.500
 then

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:53.740
 dogong kadams, talong kadams, dokka kadams, and choyar, choyar, every schools that really he

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:54.140
 received,

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:00.980
 and all the other teachings, and everything he didn't kind of left that as insignificant,

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:09.500
 everything took so important, important. So this is a great master of the false chintze. And then

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:16.020
 he reactivated, re-glorified, always in the teachings said that nine, or sorry, at practice

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:22.100
 of lineage. This is at practice of lineage, he re-glorified. And who are they? I will listen to

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:29.980
 that. At practice of lineage. And those are known as first the new mak, new mak practice, new mak.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:41.300
 Second is known as kadam, kadam ba, that is kadam. And third is known as satya or the lambda,

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.500
 lambda,

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:49.340
 lambda is a very famous teaching of the Sathya school, path and the resolve, path and resolve,

00:04:49.340 --> 00:05:01.180
 but is satya schools. And the fourth is marpakadu, kadu of marpak. And then next one is then kadu

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.340
 of

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:08.540
 shampakadu, because why they called marpakadu and shampakadu? Because there's two kadus in the

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:17.020
 practice of lineage. So marpakadu is the old kadu schools. Kadu school is big, old, and shampakadu,

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:25.740
 kadu. And then next one is known as the practice of lineage, of the Kalachakra lineage. Those are

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:31.340
 known as the six different application practice of lineage. And the next one is, I think I hope

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:54.860
 this is it. What I said is seven. What you said is six. Next one is pacifying and new practices

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:55.100
 that

00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:04.620
 mainly comes from the path dambasanghi, famous Indian great master and the magic labra dambasanghi.

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:14.780
 So it's june and shivzi lineage. And the next one is then durgisong, three regular practices. Now

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:15.260
 is it it?

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:24.060
 Yes. No? Yes. Yes. Shouldn't shivzi one or two? I think june shivzi one. Still missing one?

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:32.060
 This one was eight. What? Last one was eight. Okay so it's as they were taken in.

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:41.660
 So then that's it. Those are known as the practice of lineage. So really glorified that

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:49.100
 at practice. That includes entirely like entirely teachings of the of the Buddha, the practice

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:59.740
 lineage. Those are the eight. At lineage. And then the post chenzi is the master of the seven again

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:09.940
 of designated or authorized by seven. And those are the first is known as all the teachings that

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:10.300
 came

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:17.180
 in his memories. All they just one up another. Whether the sutta, whether that and teaching all

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:26.940
 is come as pulgraphic memories. Those are known as post designated or post power. Maybe I should

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:35.260
 use power. Post power of the knowledge is first. Second knowledge is known as then power is known

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:43.740
 as then the old the art dharma teachings. So it becomes the master of the art dharma. That what

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:54.060
 we discover dharma from the earth. And third is that he is known known as the rediscovering

00:07:54.060 --> 00:08:00.540
 dharma teachings of the earth. That means some dharma teachings come early but the teaching

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:07.420
 disappeared somehow disappeared. But according to dharma teachings even they disappeared

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:13.500
 and the reality even they disappeared in the human world. But the teaching will really stay

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:21.100
 in those the spiritual world. That is not disappeared. Also this teaching will remain

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:28.220
 with this pen of the dharma artists. The old human manuscript will remain according to the teaching

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:28.220
.

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:39.740
 So he rediscover is rediscovering dharma teachings. And fourth I believe fourth is known as then

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:47.260
 the pure vegan powers. Power of the pure vegans. And many power again he is one of the master of

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:55.740
 the tirtum with pure vegans that he discovered. And the next one is the power of the riva.

00:08:55.740 --> 00:09:05.760
 Remembering or re remembering. So the recollecting of the memories of that power of the reconnect

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:05.980
ing

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:16.700
 memories. So that is how many now? Five. And the next one is pure vegan power of the pure vegan

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:27.620
 leanings. So that is six pure vegan leanings. Number four was pure vision. Oh I say we knew. I said

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:28.140
 pure vegan. Okay satara.

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:35.100
 Also I said one of those now you put maybe I try to put all that but one of those

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:43.740
 mind tenmas. What's the mind tenmas? Put that mind. What's the mind tenmas? Now what? Now if you

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:44.140
 finish

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:51.260
 six. Finish six. And now I have to put seven. Seven is known as then the whispering power of the

00:09:51.260 --> 00:10:00.220
 whispering leanings. That means again it's part of the pure vegan. Vegan but it is from great

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:00.700
 master

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:07.180
 or great western recognition. So there are other great masters are kind of in a way whispering.

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:18.620
 So those all seven are known as seven powers of the person. So he is the master and who glorified

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:27.100
 at the practice of leanings and who hold the seven powers or cover the knee.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:39.580
 I translate also called the knee as what's called a designated two. So seven designated powers.

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:50.350
 So that is really about the first chances. And then he entered Mahaparin nirvana and Mahaparin nir

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:50.860
vana

00:10:50.860 --> 00:11:01.660
 1892. He entered Mahaparin nirvana 1892. And then now I talk a little bit about the first grade
