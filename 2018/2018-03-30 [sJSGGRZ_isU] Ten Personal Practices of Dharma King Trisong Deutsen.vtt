00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.990
 Now, when Buddhism came to Tibet at Central, beginning to come, all boring of the Buddhism in Tibet

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000
,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 that time, of course, those great three Masters or three great beings come together as gold,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 kind of like joint together, and bought entirely Buddhism in Tibet.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 And "entire" means every teaching, from Hinayana or Theravada teaching all the way to the Vedayana

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 teaching.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 The Vedayana teaching, everything, really, they both have everything.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 So, at the very beginning, then, the great Master Shinda Bhakta and Gurukva Masambhava

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 selected the very five important texts, texts that can be practiced by the King Trisong Deutsen

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 as the personal practices. And later, they also added another five, and all together,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 10 personal practices or sokar practices of the King Trisong Deutsen.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 That means it's not just only the King, but everyone, at that time, they've been practicing.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 So, now, this teaching, Heart Sutra teaching, is as the definitive meaning of the teaching,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 as Second Training Wheel of Dharma. Second Training Wheel of Dharma, as there is six big teachings,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 and eleven small teachings or condensed teaching, all together,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 seventeen different teachings of the Mother and the Children, all together.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 That's the time, during the time, that this period, that century period,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 that century period, but they're oscillated, or the eighth century and the ninth century,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 beginning of the ninth century. So, not these things.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 Those are all listed in the book that the greatest master's kingdom would be,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 and I had the opportunity to also be with him in a book known as

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 "The Sisyllas Echoes of Greater Silence." All those are listed, so I won't go on that.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 Among that, eleven children's of the teachings of the Paniyapara Mother, Heart Sutra, is one.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 One of their teachings. Now, our listed, generally, in the Nyingma teaching,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 always studying and practicing together.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 We are practicing, but at the same time, we are deepening our understanding,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 knowledge about the Buddhist teachings.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 So, I will list those five, and then, again, the other five, ten children.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 The fourth part is the Heart Sutra, which is the Sutra of the willing.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 So, that's the first one, the Sutra, that is the personal practice,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 the personal practice, the personal practice, and then everyone's.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 So, first is Heart Sutra, or Sutra of the willing.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 And then, second is Daka Yishi.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 I think Daka Yishi, we translated it one time.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 It's what's called the wisdom of the moment of death.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 That Daka Yishi is the Sutra of the meditation, Sutra of the meditation.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 So, now, we meditate.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 Then, next one is the three hips of the thirty-five Buddha practices.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 Three hips, or last we were talking about that, and I think whenever you had that.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 But this is a little bit, he said, Bodhisattva is a purification,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 Sutra of the, Sutra of purifications.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 So, Bodhisattva is purification, purification, which is Sutra of the purifications.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 So, that makes thirty-three.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 And, fourth one is, then, Sutra of the, oh, sorry, no Sutra.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 King of old aspirations, king of old aspirations, Sutra of the aspirations,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 Sutra of aspirations, all the dedication and aspirations.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 And it's a very famous phrase, I think it's translated, I saw some things,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 even though we don't have that, but it's very famous.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 Then, next one is, then, Vaidyara vidaya, Vaidyara vichanda,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 or vidaya, Sutra of the cleansing, Sutra of the cleansing.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 This is Durya Namgyu, and it's better, Durya Namgyu, which is, again,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 very famous Sutra of purification, cleansing, ceremonies, monies.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 So, those are the five first parts in the practice of the king.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 And the second parts are, first one is white umbrella practices,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 that which is Sutra of the protections.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 White umbrella, what we practice this day, is a condensate ones.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 But this is Sutra, directly teaching of the Buddha,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 the Buddha, which is not that long, but is let alone long.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 And so, that is Sutras.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:57.000
 Next one is the Amitayu Sutra, the Sutra that brings longevity and good health.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 So, that's Amitayu, Amitayu Sutras.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 And the next one is the Masudarani Norjima, I think many of you know Norjima.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 Norjima Sutra, which is Sutra of wealth.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 That is third.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 And then, the one syllable, one syllable,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:35.000
 Pandya Paramata teaching, which is Sutra of the essence.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 Essence.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 And then, Sutra of the blue jakkari, which is Sutra of the, again,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 protection and cleansings.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 And Sutra of the blue jakkari is the Vaidya Pandya Sutra, Sutra of the teachings.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 So, those are all known as ten personal practices of the characters of the ages.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 So, among that ten, this is the first one.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 And this teaching, in a sense, is so important, so special and so ponderous,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 that when the great master, in terms of the people invited,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:25.030
 in the great master Bhumal Matara, he records, "Please, will you write commentaries on these

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:26.000
 teachings?"

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 And Bhumal Matara, the great joki master Bhumal Matara wrote,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 commentaries on these Heart Sutras teachings.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 That is considered the first commentary teaching,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 the Lord on Heart Sutras, in Tibet.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 There is, then later on, the great master Lord commentaries.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 But then, later on, at the end of the tenth century, or end of the eleventh century,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 and the beginning of the twelfth century,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 there is a very famous master with great scholars, R. Satchamishi, R. Satchamishi.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 And he wrote, then, Kannada Kondran said,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 "Teaching, commentaries on these Heart Sutras,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 exactly what Bhumal Matara wrote, commentaries."

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
 He called with that, and he wrote commentaries.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:24.000
 So that is really his story of these teachings.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 Now we go to the Heart Sutras.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 Heart Sutras, I'm sure you have the text.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 "Please, you open the Bhumal Matara."

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 We're trying to go a little bit in an old-by-old,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 even though maybe we can do all the way,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 all the way, but we do.
