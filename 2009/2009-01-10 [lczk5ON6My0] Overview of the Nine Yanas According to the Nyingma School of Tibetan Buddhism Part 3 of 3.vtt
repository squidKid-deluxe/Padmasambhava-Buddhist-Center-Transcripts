 The question is, how do you feel about the Ten Gouridh?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 The question is, how do you feel about the Ten Gouridh?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 The question is, how do you feel about the Ten Gouridh?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 The question is, how do you feel about the Ten Gouridh?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 The question is, how do you feel about the Ten Gouridh?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 The question is, how do you feel about the Ten Gouridh?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 The question is, how do you feel about the Ten Gouridh?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 The question is, how do you feel about the Ten Gouridh?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.000

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 The question is, how do you feel about the Ten Gouridh?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 The question is, how do you feel about the Ten Gouridh?

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 The question is, how do you feel about the Ten Gouridh?

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 The question is, how do you feel about the Ten Gouridh?

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 The question is, how do you feel about the Ten Gouridh?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 The question is, how do you feel about the Ten Gouridh?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 The question is, how do you feel about the Ten Gouridh?

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 The question is, how do you feel about the Ten Gouridh?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 The question is, how do you feel about the Ten Gouridh?

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 The question is, how do you feel about the Ten Gouridh?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 The question is, how do you feel about the Ten Gouridh?

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 The question is, how do you feel about the Ten Gouridh?

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 The question is, how do you feel about the Ten Gouridh?

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 The question is, how do you feel about the Ten Gouridh?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 The question is, how do you feel about the Ten Gouridh?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 Now again, there is Hinayana teaching, what explaining is the self-egolessness,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 which is the egolessness state, and that is again the emptiness.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 Emptiness, that means ego, is empty.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 So which is, then, that alone explains the Daoi and the Shravaka Ayana teaching,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 or the Hinayana teaching.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.690
 Then the Parthi Buddha Ayana teaching often said, they realized the one-and-a-half-egolessness

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:07.000
 status,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 and which often said, they realized the self-egolessness status,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 and then similarly, they realized the egolessness of the object.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 And so, one-and-a-half-egolessness realization.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 And in bodhisattva realization, both full-egolessness realization,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 the subject and object, and all that, and those are the Mahayana teaching,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 which is the emptiness teaching.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 And then, again, in the three outer Tantra, explaining basically the same,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 that the nature of the self, nature of the others,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 the nature of the sound or the repetition,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 which also explain about the egolessness, emptiness realization, stated, bring that.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 And then Mahayoga teaching, as we already went through,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 that all the purity, state of true nature, very exactly as it is.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 And Anu-Yoga teaching, explaining about all teachings of this,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 the emptiness aspect of the nature, is the samad-bhadri,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 and the ephedic aspect is the samad-bhadra,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 and the union of the emptiness is then the children of the children,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 and of the blissfulness mandala.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 And that is, again, the inner Tantra, the Anu-Yoga teaching.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 And the Dzog-Chin, then, already we're discussing,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 is beyond the conception, beyond any of the mundane ideal thought,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 and that is, again, Dzog-Chin teaching.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 So, therefore, all this, kind of like, the connected,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 but as you go deeper or the higher and higher,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 then the true nature exploration is getting deeper and stronger and more wider,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 and therefore, then those different yanas are named.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 (Singing in Dzog-Chin)
