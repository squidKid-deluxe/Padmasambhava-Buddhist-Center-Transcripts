00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.750
 It is newly developed, and that means what? According to the teaching, this universe, it developed

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:20.160
 many a thousand years ago. It will last 20 years, this world where we are, where we are, it will

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.000
 last 20 years.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:33.130
 Then it will process of the decline or the demolishing that will take 20 years. The end of that

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:43.000
 demolishing, it will be completely distorted by the fire, water, wind.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 It is completely distorted, and then it is spread as a sky. According to the teaching, it will sit

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 in space, like empty spaces, another 20 years.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:08.180
 Then again, it starts forming, this spot here. It will take gradually, forming not immediately. It

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:15.900
 process of the forming perfectly connected to livable of the human base or centimeter, it will take

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.000
 20 years to process.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:30.440
 So altogether according to the teaching, idioms will complete the circle, birth, in a way, our life

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:39.000
, if you will say, our life, birth, existing, death, and then absence, and then again rebirth.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:48.970
 So that means birth, living, death, part of, and a living. Similarly, this earth will do according

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.000
 to the teaching.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.790
 So even it is crumbling, even it is like a demonic, all this happens suddenly then, those people,

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:04.000
 those individuals who are the realization of the true nature, of the ordinary nature, that person

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 don't have any faith.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 F-E-A-R, faith, no faith, because their confidence, realization is so strong.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 And the Doki teaching actually says, when you practice meditation, Doki teaching, very beautifully,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.780
 when you develop, there is poor confidence, I'm sure many of you know those, really poor confidence

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:28.000
.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:36.940
 You have no faith if somebody said, oh, you see, you're going to fail down on the hellerens, no

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.000
 faith.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:48.750
 And when you see, see, hundreds of total of the Buddhas not excited, or they're excited, you're not

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.000
 really hoping to be higher in birth or anything.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.470
 Why? Because this individual, see, everything is a dharmakaya status, everything is sambakaya

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.000
 status, everything is a dharmakaya status.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 What that change, anything kind of will extend and display a period.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 Even that display itself is a display of the primordial wisdom.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 So, for that reason, there is no faith. Faith.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.420
 And then since their realization of this, this unattached to the five octocensorial places, also

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:33.000
 not criving of the five sensorial objects, not criving.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.440
 So, that means completely beyond the house expectations. Five sensorial pleasure object, pleasure

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.000
 object, eye, eye pleasure object.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 And ear pleasure object, nose pleasure object, and tongue pleasure object, body pleasure object.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:01.520
 Pleasure object, but when you have that craving for pleasure object, then you have right at next

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.000
 door.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:09.450
 Then also fears, I don't want, I don't like this, I don't like to see bad things, I don't like to

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.000
 hear bad things,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 I don't like to do unbelievable things, taste it, smell it, all touch it, all those things.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 There is a big, unwell extraction right and left, the attitude of the extremes in the mind.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 When you have this realization, there is none of that.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 Everything is become as dharmakai, as sambokai, tatikai, at this place.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 For those reasons, the fearless yogis in the Dokitis, the fearless yogis,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 who has no partiality, discrimination of the perception of the yogis or yoginis,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 precisely where they see, where they think, they don't make any kind of like, any big deals.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 Big deals, for those reasons, what is in the teaching of the direction teacher,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 the Buddha Chagamun is teaching, when I teach, those realization with God,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 you have no, you don't see any difference between gold and gold-looking stone.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 In the debate, they call it uma.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 Gold-looking, looks like gold, doesn't have any difference, really.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 All is in the enlightened states.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 There is often a story that, when you offer the uma sambok,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 the gold by the 20 messengers, the kings and messengers, they bought gold offerings.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 When they offer the gold, immediately the uma sambok threw away those in the sky.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 The sky has offerings, and all the messengers feel so bad.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 Although it's really pretty, the gold, the uma sambok threw away,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
 they kind of felt that in their heart and mind.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:55.000
 Immediately the uma sambok read their mind and asked to hold their towers,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 when it's really true, I love it, towers, aprons, aprons,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 and they filled with stones and all those on the road, whatever,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 and filled, asked to close that, your time, and then they asked to open it.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 When you open it, all those become the gold.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 Gold and gold borders.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.000
 So that's the way, the reality in nature, there's no restrictions.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 They can change things.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 There's so openness, so flexible, so kind of energetic as a permanent system,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 it's just really vibrating, according to the teaching.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 Only duality mind is blocking.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 And modern time scientists, they are exploring those some flexible qualities.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 That's what so many wonders of the modern science is developed,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 because that is actually Buddhism.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 It's reality, it's everything possible.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 There's so many potentials, so many flexibles, no restrictions.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 Restrictions is the duality creations.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 So therefore, here, next one is also said sub-arising.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 Sub-arising even is free of the discourse of thoughts,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 and solid form, and as well as pipelines.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 That is all explaining, call it of this pristine cognition

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 of the ordinary nature, nature, nature of our own awareness and mind.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 Now, when you've got that realisation, then the display coming,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 this is the following according to the great Master Kigipati Sharamud,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 the highlight point, this is all following the display.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
 What display?

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 When you get the realisation of the Buddha-hood series,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 that all environment is enlightened.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
 Please enlighten.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 Everyone is enlightened.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 Why? Because it is versatile.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 Promote your wisdom.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 Everything is the premote your wisdom.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 For that reason, what is it?

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 Everything is formation of the guys and the wisdom.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 Everything in that display.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 So here, say, when this is nirukvah,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 you sit down.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 How, for example, Buddha summoned the Buddha.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 See everything.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 This is what it is.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 Because Buddha summoned the Buddha, how rich enlightenment?

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
 It is Buddha, false Buddha.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 So every environment is enlightened status.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 Everything.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 So since radiating clarity, evenness increases.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 Or increasing it, since it is not really blocked.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 Radiating is not blocked.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000
 Because this nirukvah is unblockable,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 unstoppable.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
 Our own awareness.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 And the conversant is true.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
 And therefore, then it is now that energy,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
 that quality is the beginning to reflect.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 Reflecting, those are.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
 Then it is a single source, which promotes your wisdom,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 or the ordinary nirukvah.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 And the five four Muslims.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 And the Muslims arise, reflect it.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 And those five Muslims, I mean,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 is actually saying that too.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 But the Muslims are the Darmadatta Muslims,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 Maryland Muslims.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 I mean many of you already know those names.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 You all know the names.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 Darmadatta Muslims, Maryland Muslims,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 equanimity Muslims, discrimination,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
 evenness Muslims.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 And all accomplishing Muslims.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 Those are the five Muslims.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
 These five Muslims, again,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 you say the kind of wisdom, you say that

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 when we think of this wisdom.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
 But wisdom is completely united with the compassion

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 and kindness and loving kindness.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 That is inseparable.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 So it's not just a bright light.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 Light or bright or something.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 It is bright, but it is love and compassion.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 Immeasurable compassion.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 Immeasurable love.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
 That is the power of the rukvah.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 Rukvah is love.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 Rukvah is compassion.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 Rukvah is wisdom.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
 Rukvah is terikaya, dharmakaya, sambokaya, namakaya.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
 These energies, these emanations

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 are also in that state.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 Love, kindness, compassion.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 Therefore, when zoki practitioners,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 as always the teachers,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
 as much as you got the realization of zoki,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 that much the compassion and thoughtful mindfulness,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 common sense are really developing.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 It comes together.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 Not just all developing the realization

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 and the common sense is completely behind some of our participants.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 All comes.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.000
 I want baggage.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
 Become the beauty of beings.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 Beauty of person.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
 Humble, simple, really beautiful.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
 You become the beacon of the beings.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 Light that you can be.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
 Exemplatory for the other beings.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
 So that we all inherit that same qualities.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000
 Holidays.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.000
 So that Muslims.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
 And if that Muslims, we explain it.
