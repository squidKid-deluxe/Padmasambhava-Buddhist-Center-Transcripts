00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480
 This is what we have to listen to. What is the principle cause of our suffering and our

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:13.860
 difficulties, but individually and as well as in the world? World in samsara.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:23.750
 This is known as "Two Egos". We think Hainji Rinpohe said here too, and this is "Two Egos". That is

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:24.000
 what we should remove.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:36.180
 "Two Egos" are the exaggerations. "Two Egos" are the publications of our duality model. It is not

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.840
 realistic.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:46.400
 Even Hainji Rinpohe said that yesterday, but his "Two Egos" are the impure relationship.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:56.580
 They are this great Master Kong. "Two Egos" are the same as "two ears" by the eye of a cataract.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:06.500
 Cataract's eye joins our tongues, or two double images. This is not realistic. It is not true. It

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.560
 is not really existing. It is just exaggerated.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:20.260
 But yet, it has become so fundamental to bring all our troubles, troubles to individualists,

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.440
 troubles to all sentient beings.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:31.320
 This is notion. This is the exaggeration of the mind. Therefore, we have to remove. We have to

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:38.180
 release by the teaching of the Mademakas.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:45.980
 That is what we have to remove. These "Two Egos", what is called? "Two Egos" are known as the

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:51.920
 individually ego and general egos.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:02:01.910
 In the Tibetan teaching, "Chi" said, "Gang za kep da" and "Chi kep da", an individually ego and a

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:13.960
 phenomenal ego, or an individually notion of "I" and a phenomenal notion of the tense.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:28.030
 This is the two egos, or the two eyes. This is the, as I said, this is, but it is deep down of this

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.860
. It is grasping, grasping.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:50.740
 For that reason, the great Master, Master Dushanti Deva said, "Here, we have to remove, remove the

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:56.200
 cause of suffering, which is the grasping."

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:08.960
 He said, then Dushanti Deva said, "Clinging on the clinging, clinging on the clinging is the cause

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.720
 of suffering that should be removed."

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:26.080
 That is, that is what is this. And therefore, this clinging then can be divided, as I said, there

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:38.500
 is two, individually, "I" or the ego, and a phenomenal clinging, phenomenal clinging.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:51.340
 This is the two, two egos. And now, this is again, all the great Masters, one voice said, from the

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.280
 Hinayana teaching, all the way to the Vedayana teaching,

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:08.010
 "Ego is trouble. Ego is problems, problematics. It is problems. And ego is, is, is just grasping,

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:15.700
 but yet, it is so sensitive, so sensitive, it is so fragile.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:27.990
 It can't take any resistance. Immediately, it suffers, even though it is, there is nothing, nothing

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.880
, nothing."

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:38.910
 And this is the one, what it is. And how that developed, and he said, first, and that is what great

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.720
 Master Dushanti Deva said,

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:50.620
 "First, you cling to yourself, that, and second, then you cling to the minds, minds. And then, all

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:57.600
 kind of nets of the grasping is beginning to develop that, that."

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:05.940
 And so, therefore, this ego has to be removed by the Mademaka teaching. It's not realistic. This,

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:12.200
 for example, according to Mademaka teaching, this poem is here.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:22.430
 House is here, earth is here, fire is here, water is here, wind is here, but ego is really not here

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.100
 at all. It's just exaggeration.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:35.640
 Even at a related level, ego is not existing as, as, as other related truths. They just said, it's

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.600
 just a notion.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:47.560
 But as I said, even though it is like that, it is the most problems, from the beginner's time until

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:53.800
 now. Therefore, it has to be released, it has to be removed.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:06:03.150
 And for that, and to do this, is again, again through the emancipation, analyzation of, of, of, of

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:09.800
 this, or again here, the great Master's kingdom you said, as like teaching.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:25.450
 And, and what is the distinction of these two egos? Distinction of two egos is, is, is, one is

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:28.800
 general and the other is particular.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:36.750
 And generally it means the first phenomenon ego, phenomenon clinging, that's it. Clinging is

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:39.800
 general. It's very general.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:50.610
 And then clinging to "I" is particular individuals. So it is, one is very general and the other is

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:53.800
 particular individuals.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:07:02.800
 And, and so now, first word, the individually ego or the "I", that is the word to walk,

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:09.800
 individually ego is the object to remove by all schools of available deserves.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:16.500
 There is no difference. There is no difference between Hine or Harabada, Mahayana and the Vedayanas

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:16.800
.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:27.600
 Even in the Vedayana Gurbia Masambhata says, see, see, obstacle is our mind. Gurbia Masambhata said

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:33.800
, obstacle is our mind, that obstacle come from mind.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:47.800
 So that conception is demon, that that demon come from mind. That's what the Gurbia Masambhata said

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.800
. So in Vedayana teaching, that is.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.800
 So from now on, from the Hine there is no difference.

00:07:54.800 --> 00:08:07.750
 This phenomenon ego is particularly that to remove. This is then special teachings of the Mahayana

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:09.800
 and that's what is Vedayana.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:20.540
 So ego is that all Buddhism accept the same thing, but then this phenomenon ego is that is what the

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:24.800
 Mahayana and Vedayana teaches it.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.800
 And so that, I think we go more closely.
