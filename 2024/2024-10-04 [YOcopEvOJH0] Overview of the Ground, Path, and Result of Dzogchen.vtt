00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.880
 According to Dzogchen teachings that we went through many times, Dzogchen teachings, our

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:16.640
 nature of the mind is totally enlightened being. Our nature of the mind is totally enlightened.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:24.960
 It has all enlightened qualities. Not just only our mind, but every living nature is totally

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.440
 enlightened, totally great natural status. Dzogchen teachings, as we talked about in

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:38.960
 Dzogchen teachings, has three Dzogchens, as I think I've mentioned many times. Again, I talked

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:47.840
 about it. The foundational Dzogchen, the path Dzogchen, and then the result Dzogchen. Generally,

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:58.000
 these three Dzogchens, the ground, path, and result Dzogchen, they're not different, three

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 different locations. It's all teaching, pointing to the one nature, to our nature of the mind.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 But however, we didn't have, even we have the own, Buddhas already enlightened status,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.080
 we've not discovered, not yet discovered. In order to discover that nature, the greatest teacher,

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:30.400
 Buddha explained more thoroughly how to reveal this nature, and to make sure that we're not really

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:39.520
 again lost in the directions. That's the reason Buddha taught this ground, path, and the result.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:49.440
 Ground is, as he said, already enlightened. It is right here. Ground, in that point,

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:58.160
 ground is resolved. Resolved ground is no difference. Path also comes from this ground.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:06.080
 This is no difference, actually reality. This is all here. But for the duality of the mind,

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:13.440
 we sense so distracted by duality, carried the force of duality outside, outskirt. So now we

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:20.240
 are returning back to our dominion, our nature. Then it's good to have this way to explain. That's

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:32.000
 what the teaching makes of that. So, the path. Path is, then what? This path is Dzogchen teaching,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.560
 first you have to receive the instructions. Even though nature is right here, but you should

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:46.080
 receive the instructions, and the empowerment, and the teachings, teachings, those are all we

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.480
 received.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:53.760
 Once we came to the application of the Dzoketi, the path, the Dzoketi, path, path practices,

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:02.320
 and then this Dzoketi has two techniques, that we all know. Gada-tikkyu, tikkyu,

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:09.600
 pure from the beginning techniques, and the thunder-pogol, saplanten is keeping our techniques,

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:18.800
 these two techniques. First, these both are nature of the mind. One is, tikkyu is more

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:25.120
 natural of the emptiness aspect of the nature of the mind, and the togal is more

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:33.440
 emphasizing on the clarity aspect of our own natural mind. Both are nature of the mind.

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:42.880
 But first, since we are so carried by the force of the duality and the destructive,

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:49.440
 therefore the emptiness aspect of the nature of the mind is more practical for us to emphasize

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:55.440
 on that. From that, when we discover the emptiness aspect of the clear nature of the mind,

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:01.360
 that will saplanten is discovering the clarity aspect of the nature of the mind. So that's why

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:08.480
 the great masters often emphasize on the tikkyu meditation. That's the main word, tikkyu.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.880
 Many of you already know tikkyu means cutting thoroughly. What cutting thoroughly means what

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:21.360
 we're cutting? Cutting thoroughly all the duality consultations. Duality consultations

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:30.720
 instantly without any trace, without any laptop, instantly. So cutting thoroughly. And tikkyu is,

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:37.920
 when we practice tikkyu, is any nature of our mind. As in this teaching mentioned,

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:44.720
 all those different teachings, the practice, everything, all is so good. But yet, when you

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:50.210
 look into the point of zuki teaching, this really weird kind of little bit detour, kind of dev

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.960
iating.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:59.200
 But zuki is the most ultimate nature of the mind. And that is our inner nature of the mind,

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:06.160
 your inner nature of the mind. The nature of our mind, or your mind, or my mind,

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:13.040
 the nature of the mind, is free from all the observations. All the observations,

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:21.200
 free from the two egos, phenomena ego and individual ego, is free from those two egos.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:29.040
 Two obstacles, even there are no names of these two egos. There are even no names of the

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:37.440
 observations. It's free from the beginning. That's why zuki terminology used so many times,

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:44.800
 free from the beginning. This is not just storytelling. Truly, our nature of the mind

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:55.840
 is free from the beginning. It's like open billion skies. Yet, this nature contains all the

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:04.320
 enlightened qualities. That also enlightened qualities, all a spontaneous, without any effort.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:11.280
 That we don't have to make any effort. If something that we have to bring with effort,

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:18.960
 that is provocation. That is a component. That is not natural. Then it will become

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:27.920
 impermanent. But zuki realization is truly our last realization when we achieve that.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:38.080
 We return back to our origin domain. We deviated from this origin with duality

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:50.080
 consumption, carried forth by the duality in a far way. Nature is never changed. So it's built

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:59.120
 from the beginning. That status. That is what really led us. We did that and then practicing

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:07.200
 of these two. Those are two practices. Many of you already received a lot of instructions and

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:14.000
 teachings. I had also opportunity many times to write all those teachings. So now, really

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.960
 practice. That to do practices, again, really the same thing. At the beginning time, we should,

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:27.280
 even though it's built from the beginning, the beginning is already here. But to discover that

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:35.200
 in nature, we have to be more practical. We have to follow the exact instructions as teaching. We

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:35.440
're

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:44.400
 full of those instructions, full of devotion, joy, appreciation, and courage, and commitment,

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:52.640
 and practicing with respect and appreciation, and then take raffles and develop the body together,

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:58.960
 and then meditate. Meditation also talking two different meditations. Even the origin nature is

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:05.360
 built from the beginning is totally in life state. We have already here, but yet we don't have that

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:05.360
.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:12.560
 Our mind is because when we start meditating, our mind is always so, so busy, so distracted,

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:20.160
 so easily distracted. In many cases, even one minute, maybe hardly to believe,

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:29.440
 our mind is safe, hardly stay in stillness. I mean, we experience, you know that. How that

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:36.640
 mind, that is how, that means our mind is so distracted. It is always running as like wind

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:44.080
 outside, like wind. Really, so much for that reason. And shamatha is very important.

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:51.870
 Even though shamatha meditation is the foundation of the zoki meditation. Zoki meditation is vipash

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:52.160
ana,

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.720
 the ultimate vipashana.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:06.480
 Vipashana, but shamatha meditation with good postures, relaxing good postures,

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:12.160
 and with good postures, and feel strong presence of the old, the lineage master,

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:17.840
 particularly in Gharbhe Masambhava, is separable with your root teacher, whoever your that may be.

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:24.880
 Really feel in one, in Gharbhe Masambhava, in body, your root teacher. In Buddhism,

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:31.680
 particularly in zoki teaching, already in teaching, always emphasize on that root teacher. Because

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:36.640
 the root teacher, you know, in teaching, is that one who gives you the empowerment, one that will

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:42.960
 explain the meaning of the teachings, or the empowerment of teaching, and give it a bit of

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:51.680
 attraction. Especially, those are known as three levels that you, who matured, or trying to mature

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:58.400
 your, our own beings. And that is called root teachers in the teaching mission. But whoever you

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:05.040
 feel strongly connected, even though that's not happened, that who connected, feel that embodiment,

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:11.360
 Gharbhe Masambhava, embodiment that is strongly connected, do the kind of prayer, such a

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:17.120
 seven-line prayer, and receiving the kind of, so many blessings, and Gharbhe Masambhava finally

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:24.760
 merge, dissolve to you, and then, you know, to you, to your own nature of the mind, and then med

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:25.360
itate

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:33.120
 that with the samatha. Trying to relax your mind, hold, follow the breathing, or concentrate on the

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:41.920
 Buddha images, right, in front of you, and how long we can concentrate on the Buddha image, or how

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:42.320
 long

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:49.840
 we can watch the breathing. How many times? Five times? Ten times? Repeated that. That was also

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:50.000
 known

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:57.330
 as timing the mind. "Tame your mind," the greatest teaching Buddha said. What does that mean? It

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:57.680
 means

00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:05.120
 time for mind, destructive mind, wild mind with emotions, calm down to the subtle states,

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:15.120
 calm and physical states. When the mind is tamed, then we begin to, our soil, our area is really

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:21.520
 perfectly beautiful. Then the Vipassana can grow so beautiful, and the Zokki meditation comes

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:29.480
 beautifully, and meditating, then trying to meditate on the Zokki status, Zokki, Zokkin, or med

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:30.000
itate on

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:37.760
 the Zokki, Zokkin, Zokkin. So this is, and then here he said, "Explain the required

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:42.080
 actualization of the insight and the primordial business."

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:49.840
 It's the Buddha, samatha Buddha, is free from abandoning and attainments. And that means what,

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:57.510
 I think I mentioned already, the enlightenment, the Buddhahood, or the enlightenment is right with

00:11:57.510 --> 00:11:58.080
 us,

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:07.760
 so it's not something that we have to grab. It's free from, as SNA said, free from attainment and

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:18.800
 abandon and attainment. There's nothing went away. And when we regain our own reality and nature of

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:25.840
 the what we gain, it's really achieving that. That is the Buddhahood, so it's really right here,

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:33.520
 here, so it's right here. And then continuing that this is the completion and the essence and

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:37.760
 nature of the path of the samsara nirvana. So this all, like everything.

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:44.800
 Maybe now we stop here, and I think we stop here.
