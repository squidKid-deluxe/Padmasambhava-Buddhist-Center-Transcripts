00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.280
 We all wish to be like Guru Rinpoche. That's our wish for all. Thank you.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:21.900
 Guru Rinpoche, would you tell us a little bit about what happened when Guru Rinpoche appeared

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.980
 for the first time in our world? When he was born, when he appeared, would you teach about

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:36.800
 Padma Samye Ling? In the teachings, he said that 8 years after

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.680
 the Buddha Shakyamuni's Mahaparin nirvana, Guru Rinpoche and Mahasambhava appeared in

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:48.980
 the center of the light, Dhanakosha, in the middle of the beautiful floor, lot or so,

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:56.980
 Oudhamara floors, and actually the upcoming of that, even predicted by the Buddha Shakyamuni

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:03.480
 himself. Before he entered Mahaparin nirvana, or before he was going to pass away, and with

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:14.980
 his announcement that he was going to pass away, many disciples were very upset at the

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:23.480
 news, and particularly in the teachings, Anand became very emotional, very his attendance.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:30.980
 Anand was become emotional. And so Buddha said, "Don't be upset, and I will be back in

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:37.980
 the upper eight years from my Mahaparin nirvana or passing away from me. I will be back, and

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:45.980
 that time even I'm better than what I am now." And of course, there is nothing better than

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:52.980
 the Buddha Shakyamuni, but the Buddha Shakyamuni would like to glorify the importance and how

00:01:52.980 --> 00:02:00.980
 special his reincarnation will be, the Guru Rinpoche. So as Buddha pray lifted, and then

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:09.980
 Guru Pima Sambhava came, appeared in the center of like Dhanapocha. And also Guru Pima Sambhava

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:16.980
 is not just only the emanation of the Buddha Shakyamuni, or reincarnation of the Buddha

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:25.980
 Shakyamuni, but also he is known as the emanation of the Buddha Amitabha. Buddha Amitabha is

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:32.980
 the Buddha of living Buddha now. It's not just the past Buddha, no, it's not future Buddha,

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:39.980
 but this Buddha is right now living. In the Buddha Shakyamuni, his teachings said, "West

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:48.980
 direction of where we are now, this whole, many, many universe are past the west direction.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:55.980
 From here, there is the pure land or the land of the Buddha Amitabha is residing. And the

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:03.980
 land of the Buddha Amitabha is known as the blissful land, peaceful land, harmony land.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.980
 There is no more war, no more sufferings, no more difficulty. Even the names of the

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.980
 suffering and difficulty sickness are never existing, that pure land. Everyone that those

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:22.980
 beings who are living there, places are very happy, joy, peaceful, and also performing so

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:29.980
 many beautiful activities based upon the true love, true compassion, true wisdom, respect,

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:36.980
 appreciation. Because of that, there is not any disturbance at all. So that's also named

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:43.980
 as land of the blissfulness, land of the peace and harmonious.

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.980
 So Gurbi Masambhava is also known as the direct emanation of the Buddha Amitabha, that living

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:56.980
 Buddha to this universe of war. So as is the pre-rendered dimension and Gurbi Masambhava

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:03.980
 appeared, as I said, two, like eight years after the Buddha Shakyamuni's Mahabharata

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.980
 in the run. And then Gurbi Masambhava appeared right in the middle of the Lord was in the

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:15.980
 ticket. He said, like eight-year boys, like youthful as a black boy. And the area came

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:23.980
 on in the Buddha, he adopted as his son, and then grown up, and then Gurbi Masambhava

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:30.980
 performed so many, that Gurbi Masambhava performed so many extraordinary activities that

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:37.980
 benefited so many beings that bring joy, peace, happiness, remove obstacles, obscurations,

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:44.980
 disease, sickness for all their wishes. And he's been there for a long time, for many

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:51.980
 years. After that time, then he also left that kingdom or that area and then went throughout

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:59.980
 India and all different islands in the teachings. So many different islands he went and blessed

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:07.980
 and taught calm and peace and value of the human beings and respect and peace to all

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:13.980
 living beings and those really teaching taught so many years. And then Gurbi Masambhava came

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:19.980
 to Tibet in the eighth century, according to the chronology system. There's many different

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:34.980
 systems, but one of the systems said that Gurbi Masambhava came in 763, around 762. So 762-80

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:42.980
 that Gurbi Masambhava came, and then he was one of the founders of the Tibetan Buddhism.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:47.980
 He bought entirely help to bring the Buddha Dharma in the Tibetan country, along with

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:52.980
 the great Master Shedah Rachidah and the great thinkers of their thing. And so many great

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:58.980
 beings appeared one after another, or take the bird, and those are known as 25 disciples

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:07.980
 or 80 Mahasadas of the region. So many great beings really bloomed there. So many those

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:14.980
 great beings like who bring peace, harmony, and they themselves also become true peace

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:22.980
 and harmony and reach the highest development of the human can achieve or the potential

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:30.980
 offer that all achieved by that, that these great beings. And then Gurbi Masambhava stayed

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:40.980
 in Tibet about 55 years and then he left Tibet and just flew up in the sky. So Gurbi Masambhava

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:46.980
 is considered the living Buddha right now. Gurbi Masambhava is also achieved transcendental

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:52.980
 wisdom, rainbow body, which is beyond death and birth. He transformed his element or the

00:06:52.980 --> 00:07:04.980
 physical element as refined as sub-nuclear rainbow wisdom body. So it's like that power

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:10.980
 is achieved. So elements are not gross as we are. It's transcendental wisdom in the teachings

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:16.980
 say the wisdom, rainbow body, or like the essence of the most nuclear like task, lucid state

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:23.980
 or call it that achieved. So all element that are formed. And not just the element of his

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:29.980
 mental mind is also in the past the full bloom of the enlightened state or the potential

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:36.980
 of the human beings or that nature in completely. So therefore Gurbi Masambhava is a living Buddha.

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:43.980
 Even after he left Tibet and so many of us as one after another, he saw Gurbi Masambhava

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:51.980
 on the direct perspective as we see each other or in the vision, in the dream. And so many

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:57.980
 of us, so many of those great beings throughout generations and from the 8th century until

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:05.980
 now, there's so many really beings are always taught as great living, great master teacher

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:12.980
 in Gurbi Masambhava. And so that is a brief story of the Gurbi Masambhava.

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:13.980
 Thank you.

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:22.980
 And then also, so according to the history that Gurbi Masambhava was born this month

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:31.980
 and this day. And so therefore this consider as what he appeared in the Lord also. Therefore

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:39.980
 this consider is one of the very special days of the old years. That's what I'm going to

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:44.980
 say. Happy Birthday. Thank you. Thank you everyone again.
