 "Mantra, as well as from the Buddha Vajrasattva, emanating large winds of light of compassion

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:18.640
 that lighten up all the three realms and purify everyone's obstacles, obscurations, and

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.520
 difficulties

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:27.600
 such as birth, getting old, sickness, death, and all other frightening situations, whatever

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:33.520
 they experience, everything is completely played in the passive fire. Particularly if you have

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:40.320
 someone that you like to pray, treat them also when so directly, and remove all their

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:47.680
 obscurations, handles, or blockage, whatever they experience there. Asking the clairway

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.880
 and both are part of the joy and the peace. And every devil's person who has received

00:00:52.880 --> 00:01:00.640
 a pass-through, also again the same way cleansing the purify, all the negativities of obstacles,

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:07.520
 whatever it is, is instantly liberated or brought to the Pure Land of the Buddha. And so this

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.800
 practice is not just only for us, but for all the beings and thinking of it, and as well as

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:19.280
 ourselves to remove, cleanse, and purify, so we will have the bright and beautiful

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:26.320
 fulfillment of the future. And those are the same, and I said so many times,

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:32.720
 and a great boss in a kinky part of the ceremony said many times, we have spent this hour and hour,

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.240
 over 25 years. So I think many of you came and you are joined, you are part of this

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.560
 mandala, part of the ceremony, you did remember them. So with this company igniting this beautiful

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:51.440
 motivation, this is meditation, this is practice, this is visualization, this is a complete state,

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:57.760
 and this is zuki meditation, mai mutta meditation, it is rifantana meditation,

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:04.960
 chamahana meditation, all combined together as one simple beautiful practice that touches

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:11.360
 direct heart of enlightenment, and heart of enlightenment to ourselves, yourself. That is

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.320
 what it is, really. So therefore, I'm not going to talk too much again and again, same thing,

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:22.720
 I spoke yesterday, before that, and so you all know, I mean, that's it. So I just want to remind

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:31.520
 you, this is so important, and it is a wonderful to begin our new year with this ceremony,

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:39.360
 with this spiritual, but he didn't call it hours, bravely call it hours, to touch to that quality

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:47.760
 and begin our beautiful region of this year. It's something marvelous, awesome, beautiful,

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.520
 really truly, I'm not just saying that, that is what it is, that is what it is. We're not talking

00:02:53.520 --> 00:03:00.800
 of something kind of bragging and arrogance, but we're touching to our best, humble, simple,

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:07.600
 beautiful, yet magnificent, that's what we're talking. We're making ourselves as beautiful

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:14.630
 impressions, and with that, again, so this is what roughly teaching says, and again, we now begin

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.800
 to,

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:21.600
 again, continue your meditation as yourself, or be in that state, we maybe don't have to use

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:27.680
 meditation, be in that state, be what you are, the original state, and that, let's begin,

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:42.320
 that's the journey and the adventure begins, that's it truly.
