00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.840
 Thank you, everyone. Thank you. Welcome, everyone. Welcome. Welcome. Thank you.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.400
 Now, again, we're going to engage into the teaching of the Buddha.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.360
 The entire teaching of the Buddha is teaching on the low-incomeness, completion,

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.760
 and the doom in appreciation, exploring our beautiful nature,

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:28.080
 and helping also to explore their beautiful nature according to their readiness and capability.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.960
 That is the teaching of the Buddha in time. From the day one he is teaching,

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.320
 until he enters Mahabharata in the run, he teaches.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.520
 Among those teachings, our Buddha is categorized as you all know,

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.480
 and many different levels of categories. Today, we are dealing

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.080
 with the highest teaching of the Buddha Shatamuna.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.600
 Why is the highest? Because it's the teachings of the Buddha.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.480
 The wisdom, the primordial wisdom is not based on the conceptual levels.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.520
 It's not based on the conception to dispel the conceptions.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:09.920
 This is not the conception teaching. This is the teaching of beyond the conception teaching.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:17.760
 We are directly communicating, connecting to our old and natural beyond the conception.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.160
 That teaching says so many times. I said also repeatedly follow the teaching,

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.680
 said so many times. The great master, Kinti, Parthachara, Rumbuji,

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.000
 and other great masters always say that. Think of that.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.520
 This is not conception teaching. This is the teaching of the original primordial

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:42.720
 wisdom teaching which is inherited to all of us.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.840
 It's exploring that beauty, that nature, that goodness.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.440
 This, there's nothing higher teaching and deeper teaching, more profound and

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:59.280
 more direct teaching than this. This teaching, and therefore, again,

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.160
 what we need to do, we should understand our joy and appreciation.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:11.360
 Joy and appreciation, how blessed we are, how beautiful and lucky we are,

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.800
 that we really can connect to this such beautiful nature.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.680
 Very simple, very ordinary, very basic. We don't have to make big loads,

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.080
 speech, and this and that, but something they discover from the inner beauty,

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.080
 the shine, let that shine to the out, and that is the marvelous.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.560
 That is awesome. Is there something big deal, maybe big sins?

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.560
 This is what it is. This is what the great master is always,

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.840
 joy and appreciation. That is the very big best of this nature,

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.640
 and that is our practice. With this, and then recreating the bodhic jhaka,

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.280
 loving kind is compatible to all living beings without any exceptions,

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.560
 without any discrimination, vastness, motivation of the bodhic jhaka,

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.920
 increasing that, and together bring that, the purity,

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.680
 understanding, entire this universe as pure states,

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.440
 in the three kaya states, dharma kaya, sambho kaya,

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.000
 and then narmaka kaya state practice, this is what it is, reality now.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 And so bring up those all, realization, and with that realization,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.920
 we go through these teachings. These teachings are no other than

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.360
 teachings on the joy and appreciation, bodhic jhaka,

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.480
 purity, and how to be in that nature still.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.400
 That is the teaching itself that we went through and you see this.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.880
 So now,
