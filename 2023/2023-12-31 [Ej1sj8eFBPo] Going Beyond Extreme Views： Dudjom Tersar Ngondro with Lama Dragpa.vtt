00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 Thank you, friends. Thank you. Warm greetings. Welcome. Warm-hearted welcome. Greetings. Thanks

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.480
 for joining. Here we are again, another session of Dudjom Tersar Ngondro practice. We'll begin,

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.180
 as usual, with like a short time to reflect or contemplate on the teachings, the Dharma.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.780
 So there's always these three ways we poise our mind and open our heart that we've been

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:41.400
 taught by all the lineage masters, including our own, precious, root gurus, lineage masters,

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.220
 Ven. Kenshin, Palanciya, Rinpoche, Ven. Khenpo Tsewang Dongya Rinpoche, and these three points

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:54.160
 are have joy and appreciation, or refuge, this renunciation mind. And secondly, Bodhichi

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:01.120
 Ta. Genuine heartfelt wish for all beings to be free of suffering and the cause of suffering,

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:08.720
 and I personally will become enlightened to bring this about, to make this happen. Then

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:17.800
 pure perception, kind of relaxing confidently, kind of allowing the kind of natural intelligence

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:26.800
 and brightness and spaciousness of our own hearts and minds to just be as they are, natural,

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:34.880
 bright, clear, and call this divine or pure, to let our body's speech and mind rest, relax

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:42.840
 naturally, say purely. So to kind of just confidently be in pure body, pure speech,

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:50.860
 pure mind, that's deity, mantra, Dharmakaya, and that everything we experience around us

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:59.320
 is mandala. It's like an enlightened world. So with this joy and appreciation, or gratitude,

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:24.520
 bodhicitta, and pure perception, we become receptive to the Dharma. We all do that together

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:47.280
 together. Thanks so much. So as usual, there's kind of like a theme to kind of contemplate

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:56.120
 around. And then this week, the theme is pulling the rug out from under oneself, pulling the

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:03.240
 rug out from under oneself. That's today's theme. And so I thought today I was thinking

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:09.840
 this morning is kind of fitting. It's about to be New Year, just what a couple days. So

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:17.240
 often a good part or practice of New Year, of like allowing space for fresh blooms to

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:26.260
 come out is a little bit clean out the cobwebs, clean house a little bit. So pulling out the

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:33.680
 rug from under oneself. So this is a theme that's like very strong, and I think very

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:44.000
 direct. And as a good Dharma practice, it's actually about one's own mind, my mind and

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.080
 how my mind gets locked into extreme views. So this time is going to be a little bit of

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:58.800
 a survey of all the ways my mind locks itself into extreme views. And I need to pull the

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:05.480
 rug out from under that. I need to kind of dismantle this fixation, need to relax this

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:13.720
 tight grasping egoic, what is it called? Cunning self-important ego ghost. And Kimbo-san and

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.280
 Don Nurembuche's prayer to his Holiness Dujurembuche, which we read together as Sangha across the

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:25.120
 world in different pockets, this poem to his Holiness Dujurembuche is a strong line. May

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.640
 we really mingle our minds and become like these great masters, these really noble ones,

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:35.680
 and to do so we really have to release our grasping. It's the path. So we have to release

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:41.740
 grasping onto eternalism and nihilism, holding too tightly onto something, pushing everything

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:48.800
 else away too strongly. Acceptance, rejection, constantly distorting what's natural, the

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:56.320
 natural flow. Instead, we're locking, freezing, fixating, grasping. So we're the only ones

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.000
 that can really release this. We have to learn to, what does it say, be the master of our

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.800
 own minds, be our own teacher, to pull the rug out from under ourselves. This is kind

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.240
 of what this path is leading us to, so we can actually stand up confidently on our own

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:19.800
 two feet. And so to begin, I thought the natural place for me to begin was to actually read

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.440
 something from Ken Rinpoche, Ken Chipoloshe Rinpoche, and it was a quick little story

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:30.040
 that's online on PBC, Padmasavava.org. There's personal stories about Ken Rinpoche's and my

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:36.400
 brother Andrew, he related a story, and I'll just read it short. He called it, "Look to

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:43.760
 your own mind." And this is Andrew. "One day I was walking with Ken Shin Rinpoche up the

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:49.920
 driveway at PSL during a month-long retreat. Rinpoche's had been giving the most profound

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.600
 heart essence teachings of the clear light great perfection for several weeks. After

00:05:54.600 --> 00:06:00.000
 some time I asked him, 'What makes us qualified to receive these profound and secret teachings?'

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.440
 And he told me that we'd come from all around with a sincere interest and curiosity and

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:12.240
 learning and practicing the dharma. And that was enough for him. Then I mentioned to Rinpoche

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.400
 how it seemed like some of us treated the teachings so casually, leaving precious Zogchen

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.520
 books next to the shoe rack and garbage can with a little mindfulness. Ken Shin Rinpoche

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:28.440
 stopped and looked at me in the eyes, and he spread his arms out as wide as he could,

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:39.200
 and he said, 'The view of Zogchen is like this, as vast as the sky, so big. When you start

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:45.480
 looking at the faults of others, oh, they're doing this wrong, that wrong, your view gets

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:51.280
 smaller and smaller.' And he moved his arms closer until his hands were right next to

00:06:51.280 --> 00:07:01.320
 the side of his head, like a horse with blinders on. That's not Zogchen. That's not even Buddhism.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:08.120
 In Buddhism we look to our own mind all the time. That's the practice, and that's what

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:17.280
 we should do. And Andrew said, 'I never forgot that.' So I thought to emphasize that at front

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:24.800
 because this is a little bit of a direct, I'm going to say some direct things. So this is

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:34.160
 really strong, these strong teachings. Dharma can be very clear reflections sometimes, especially

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:42.240
 when we're pointing out extreme views. And the pointing is going back to me. How am I

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:48.080
 doing this? Because that's the only thing I can really do anything about. My mind, my

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:56.120
 heart, my motivation. At the same time, I also think some degree for myself, and it's like

00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:02.240
 I have to say something now, need to actually kind of like dust this off a little bit. Now

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:09.540
 in the kind of AI information explosion age, it's so easy to be clever about Dharma. It's

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:15.440
 so easy to sound Dharma smart. It's still very difficult to really absorb the teachings

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:24.880
 and let them change you. So when it's a time that's so easy to repeat these profound instructions,

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:34.920
 we need to freshen this up. We really need to freshen this up. So part of my New Year's

00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:40.920
 resolution is I should want to reread a book that was really impactful for me called Poison

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:49.280
 is Medicine, Clarifying the Vajrayana. This is a free PDF download book, e-book, by Zong

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:55.720
 Sart Ken Sidermache. Poison is Medicine, Clarifying the Vajrayana. My resolution is to reread

00:08:55.720 --> 00:09:01.320
 this book this year. So I think I can do this resolution. It's really kind of short 200

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:06.640
 pages. It's so very readable. I'm going to start with some quotes from there to freshen

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:18.840
 the context, pulling the rug out from underneath oneself. Page 173. Only those of you who have

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:24.880
 genuinely set your hearts on learning how to transform how you think should even consider

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:36.900
 setting foot on the tantric path. We really have to be willing to change. Another quote.

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:45.360
 Same book, page X. This is right at the beginning. Zong Sart Ken Sidermache. The Vajrayana is

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:52.120
 the best thing that ever happened on this planet. Not only does it train us to think

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:58.400
 outside of Samsara's box, it shows us how to be inside and outside the box at the same

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:05.620
 time. And although the tumultuous ocean of jealousy, anger, pride, doubt, greed and delusion

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:12.880
 that fills our minds can feel extremely daunting, the Vajrayana tells us it needn't be. The

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:18.880
 antidote to all that poison is not outside us but within. We already have exactly the

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:26.320
 right dose. Not a single drop is missing. Nothing needs improving. Upgrading, customizing or

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:33.200
 adapting. Our innate wisdom is the antidote we seek. It is perfectly intact and available

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:41.000
 for immediate use as it always has been. Is this idea too hard for you to chew? If it

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:48.080
 isn't, why not have a go at tracking down your own innate wisdom? How? By following wisdom's

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:55.760
 footprints which are your emotions. The essence of the Vajrayana's message is that poison

00:10:55.760 --> 00:11:04.060
 is medicine just as it is with nothing added and nothing taken away. I hope and pray that

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:11.400
 none of you ever lose your enthusiasm for and curiosity about this glorious, brilliant,

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:31.160
 incomparable path. How fortunate we are. There's so many juicy quotes from this book. One more.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:41.880
 Message 233. By changing just one word of the Buddha Dharma, by changing just one word,

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:48.160
 you effectively take on full responsibility for the spiritual path and enlightenment of

00:11:48.160 --> 00:12:00.900
 all future practitioners. I, for one, lack the courage to do such a thing. So we're talking

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:13.000
 about lineage teachings here. And this is all around a similar topic that's been debated

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:21.260
 in Buddhism for centuries. What's the essence? What's the expression? What's provisional?

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:28.360
 What's definitive? And so all inquiry into extreme views is trying to ascertain the difference

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:36.840
 between these two. What is definitive? What is provisional? What can be adapted? What

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:43.960
 is unchanging? This is a very deep topic in Buddhism and all these Buddhist philosophical

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:49.880
 schools debate this topic. And we can look at this in fresh ways, which I think is kind

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:55.160
 of needed in some ways. And we just have to be doing adaptive things and not break anything

00:12:55.160 --> 00:13:04.400
 essential. But some basic secular, simple frameworks for boxing up in a really simple way. Some

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:16.280
 extreme views is looking at these few boxes. Pre-modern extreme views, modern extreme views,

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:26.560
 post-modern extreme views, post-modern extreme views. This is not in Buddhism. These words

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:34.600
 aren't in Buddhism. Similar to the Buddha didn't teach in English. There's a lot of

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:42.720
 different communication things we're using now. The Buddha did not use English, internet,

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:49.440
 these nations. There's so many filtering systems we're using that weren't talked about.

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:55.600
 So here's an additional one that's really simple and it totally fits with teachings.

00:13:55.600 --> 00:14:02.060
 So pre-modern extreme thinking. What are pre-modern extreme views we need to kind of dust off

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:08.720
 and open up and relax our grasping mind around? This is just some. It's like a grab bag list

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:15.000
 that I came up with just really quickly, actually. Pre-modern extreme views. These are all the

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:24.800
 ways that we are literalists, fundamentalists. My path is the only path. My teacher is the

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:36.920
 best. My outfit is the right one. My sangha is the best. All the outer features. We think

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:53.660
 this is the essence. Tibetan language is the best. Sanskrit is the best. This is just fundamental

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:55.120
ism.

00:14:55.120 --> 00:15:02.160
 We can value the ways things are expressed and not become a fundamentalist just because

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:08.480
 we like hamburgers doesn't mean they're the best. Just because Buddhism works for me doesn't

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:12.840
 mean it works for everyone. Just because a certain teaching in Buddhism works for me

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:20.000
 today it might not really help me tomorrow. This is a constant shifting dynamic. This

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:28.560
 mind of mine. And this shifting mind of mine, what it's scared of doing is it's basically

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:35.880
 losing control. What it does is it grabs on and tries to stop the movement, the change.

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:45.440
 The most obvious way we do this is with literal stuff like clothing, colors, sounds, shapes,

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:56.440
 the obvious, tangible, sensorial stuff. This is all extreme view. This goes really deep.

00:15:56.440 --> 00:16:02.640
 This is just the very easy stuff to recognize. This is extreme. Anytime we're in a mode where

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:06.520
 my religion is the best and then we say, oh, there's bad things about others, that breaks

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:12.880
 the sixth root downfall in Vajrayana. Oh, my way is the best. My practice is the best.

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:17.800
 Your practice, eh, I tried that for a while. It wasn't so good. That breaks the third root

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:26.920
 downfall. This kind of fundamentalism the Buddha taught very clearly. Don't look at the teacher.

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:34.680
 Look at the teaching. Don't be in celebrity obsession mindset. What's the teaching? What's

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:43.520
 the dharma? Don't obsess with the doctor. Actually carefully consider the medicine.

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:53.320
 This is so straight up bedrock Buddhism. This whole set of extreme views is really something

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:58.960
 to look at, especially as dharma goes into other countries, other times, other languages,

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:05.160
 other configurations. There can be a lot of mistakes made with this. Mis-asserting, what's

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:11.400
 the expression and what's the essence? That's what all of these extreme views have to be

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:18.160
 really careful. What needs to be preserved? What can be adapted? I think that's why we

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:24.160
 have lineage, ongoing systems of checks and balances of actually trying these things out

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:30.600
 over long periods of time and not just recklessly, quickly changing things up either. We're not

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:35.560
 just innovating all these wonderful, valuable things out of existence so quickly. We're

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:43.360
 trying to preserve the root value, the essence of Buddhism without changing a single word.

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:53.400
 But it has to be able to zing, like clearly, crisply ring in people with genuine interest,

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:58.880
 and that's on the skillful means of the practitioner. For my own mind, how do I skillfully make

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:04.360
 the teaching come alive in my own mind? To some degree, I really need to get out of this

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:10.600
 mindset of my way, my teaching, my this, my that, is the only way, the best way, or insert

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:18.360
 some other rigid, reifying, calcifying grasping that says my way is the best way, every other

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:24.520
 way is not as good. I'm right, you're wrong. This is standard black and white binary thinking

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:31.160
 is so obviously not nearly 21st century anymore. I think this is very self-evident at this

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:36.600
 point. Hyperpolarization, maybe it's not that evident to a lot of people, but for Buddhists,

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:44.920
 this should be really obvious. So that's the general bucket of pre-modern literal fundamentalism.

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:51.080
 I can go into this really with a lot of detail, but our time is really short. There's the

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:55.200
 good versions of pre-modern things, and we'll get to this at the end quickly. There's the

00:18:55.200 --> 00:19:01.000
 extreme ways of doing these things. There's the healthy balanced ways of doing these things.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.480
 So then going through the extremes first, the fixation, what needs to be kind of freshened

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:15.560
 up. Oh, extreme modernism. How am I an extreme modernist? If I say the teaching has to be

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:24.080
 logical, has to be rational, has to make sense. Where's the data? I want to see the statistics.

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:32.240
 It has to fit in my box, right? This is a little more subtle because my box now is not just

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:42.760
 the way I look, but it's how I think my system of logic, my sense making, my internal box.

00:19:42.760 --> 00:20:09.800
 So it's not the outer features, the house I'm in, the landscape. It's how my mind functions.

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:13.640
 So we'll get to the view here in a minute. This is all really kind of pointing towards

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:19.720
 the view. But so what are the ways that I can fixate on my logic? Is it has to be linear?

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:28.980
 Same way, has to be non-linear. Does it have to be human centric? Has to be non-human centric.

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:37.120
 These are big pattern boxes we fit everything into. How can I not as human? Well, the great

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:46.200
 Bumi Bodhisattvas, they don't do that. They've given up. That's why they emanate in other

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:54.840
 bodies in other realms. If you go to the Raksha realm, the Naga realm, they don't look like

00:20:54.840 --> 00:21:02.000
 a human there. They look like a Naga. It's not human centric. They're reflecting what's

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:08.900
 actually helpful for the beings that they're in contact with. This is really flexible to

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:13.080
 how can we do this? What's like learning language is a very good example. If you're speaking

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:18.160
 with someone who only speaks French, if you don't know French, the limit of your capacity

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:23.040
 to communicate, to connect with them, to actually share intimate experience, to tell jokes and

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:32.040
 laugh at the same time is severely limited. It's up to you as Bodhisattva to learn French,

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:37.480
 to learn what it's like to be a squirrel, to consider what it might be like to be a Naga.

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:42.960
 What is it like for other humans that aren't in my shoes? This is standard Bodhisattva stuff.

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:48.600
 What's the world like in someone else's shoes? Not just how do I treat them the way I want

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:56.640
 to be treated. I treat them the way they want to be treated. This is a Bodhisattva approach.

00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:03.640
 If we demand, "Everything fits into my logic, my sense making, my way of doing this." This

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:11.840
 is just modernism, hyper rationalism, has to make sense. It always means my sense making.

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:17.960
 There are a lot of different sense making. We can look at that. That's when we get into

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:21.960
 postmodern. Postmodern says, "What are you talking about? Which lens are you talking

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:30.760
 about? Which frame?" Male frame, female frame, non-binary frame, old frame, English frame,

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:40.660
 indigenous frame, Tibetan frame, Indian frame, squirrel frame, animal frame. Which way? Because

00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:47.400
 if we assume there's one frame everyone else has to fit in, that's called hegemony, right?

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:55.400
 I mean, it's just empire. This is a classic colonial move. This is a no-no. Everyone knows

00:22:55.400 --> 00:23:00.840
 this now. You can't just go into some foreign country and just change everything the way

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:10.480
 you want it, even though we do this. I just recently did it. It's called tourism. This

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:18.440
 is a problem with extreme kind of thing that opens up in postmodernism, hypermobility.

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:23.080
 If I have the ability, the luxury, the advantage to move into different situations, places

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:29.340
 on the earth, different fields of exploration, different ideas, different cultures, different

00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:35.560
 online communities, am I playing according to the terms that are established in the community

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:41.640
 or in the culture or in the ecology? Or am I just coming in and I'm going to tell you

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:53.960
 my story, my feelings, my truth, my opinion? Because that breaks living ecology. You go

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:58.920
 somewhere as a tourist and you make everything have to fit according to your opinion, that's

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:10.560
 literally colonialism in the name of postmodernism. It's really funny. And my mind does this as

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:18.400
 we move between different situations more and more as the Dharma is doing now. How does

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:24.840
 the Dharma go into a new culture and not break the culture, but be shaped by the culture

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:34.400
 but shaped in ways that don't break the fundamental essence of the Buddha Dharma by even one word?

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:45.040
 This is the same inquiry of provisional verse definitive. So how do we not break living

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:52.360
 ecology? How do we actually respect a place when we arrive into it? How do we show up

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:58.040
 and listen instead of show up and yell? I mean, how do we establish good faith dynamics

00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:04.600
 in a conversation? These are all so relevant. And for bodhisattvas, this has to be the impulse

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:13.560
 of bodhisattvas. It has to be. They said so many times, Buddhism never forced anything

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:19.920
 on anyone. He just saw what is available to be helped, to be nourished, what's the readiness

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:26.560
 of others, their disposition, their readiness. And then what's my capability? What's the

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:31.720
 communication? What's the shared experience to kind of work within? And then the Buddha

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:38.680
 reflected that. This is so deeply, this is called being a custodial species, as Tyson

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:44.880
 Yom Kippur says. We go to a place and mutually benefit. This is the way of the bodhisattva.

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:53.000
 It's not going to a place and just pushing my thing. One way to go to a place and push

00:25:53.000 --> 00:26:02.880
 my thing is demand everything to not make sense. This is so tricky mind. The hyper extreme

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:10.890
 modernist says everything has to be rational. Extreme postmodern, everything has to be non-rational

00:26:10.890 --> 00:26:11.240
.

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:20.360
 And this is totally against Buddhism, definitely against Nyingma Buddhism. They always say

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:27.420
 it's a union of study and practice. Another way you can say that is merit and wisdom.

00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:33.240
 Another way you can say that is positive grasping and non-grasping. Another way you can say

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:42.100
 that is like helpful concepts called study and contemplation and going beyond concepts.

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:51.320
 That's called wisdom of meditative insight. Always both. We have to include both the rational

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:59.280
 or any way of any sense making, a coherent pattern system of knowledge. In addition,

00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:05.320
 we have to go beyond all patterned ways of making sense because we have to become flexibly

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:11.880
 able to move between them without breaking them. So if you play tennis, I play tennis.

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:16.020
 You play basketball, I play basketball. You speak English, I speak English or Spanish

00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:22.720
 or French or computer programming of many different kinds of computer programming languages.

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:28.520
 Bodhisattvas can flexibly move between games. We often think of it as dreams. That's why

00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:33.240
 they're so skillful. How could they do that? Because they have the prajna, the wisdom,

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:39.080
 the non-conceptual insight to actually see it's just a game. It's just a dream. This

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:44.280
 is just an apparition. It's mere appearance. So they don't get caught with the result of

00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:48.840
 the dream of the game. So then they can give the victory to others, make it a good dream

00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:55.480
 for someone else. But you have to know how to play the game you're in to do that effectively

00:27:55.480 --> 00:28:03.120
 to support someone else. You have to actually vibe with the living local ecology. And then

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:11.880
 this goes into also extreme view of post-postmodernism. Knowing how a game works, knowing how an

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:17.440
 ecology functions, knowing how a company runs, knowing how the history of Buddhism is very

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:24.800
 different than letting the dharma affect you. Just using clever dharma words, studying dharma,

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:29.080
 study, study, study, this one is Deuterim but she said this in Mountain Retreat Instructions.

00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:33.920
 If you become an expert scholar of Buddhism but you don't ever apply the teachings in

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:40.220
 your life, it won't really help much. When you die, you'll have been able to say many

00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:46.120
 things but it didn't really change you. It didn't really make you of much benefit to

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:52.000
 other beings. It's so valuable to have dharma books around even if you never read them.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.960
 But it's so much more valuable to actually read them, try to absorb the meaning. So you

00:28:55.960 --> 00:29:03.440
 become one with the dharma. You let it change you. And that means we can't always hold things

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:09.920
 at a distance and that's something we get really good at. Once we go beyond extremism

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:16.800
 of postmodernism, we start to be able to get a very encompassing bird's eye view. We start

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:23.840
 to see a lot of big patterns. We start to connect a lot of dots between different systems.

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:28.760
 Between different Buddhist schools, for example. What's the perfect example of this capacity

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:35.080
 turning on? The nine yana system. It's a meta framework. It's a meta system. How do all

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:41.040
 the yanas fit together? How do all the Buddhist philosophies fit together? How does one philosophy

00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:46.560
 like Babaśika go into the next one like Śrījāntaka go into the next one like mind only and then

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:53.880
 madhyamaka, then tantra, then zogchen. That's a meta theory. It's a meta theoretical framework.

00:29:53.880 --> 00:30:00.460
 This is a function of healthy post postmodernism. It links up different systems into larger

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:06.960
 coherent holes. This is straight up bread and butter Buddhism. This is like essential

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:15.040
 ningmo Buddhism. Otherwise, if you don't agree to that, you don't have nine yanas. You just

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:20.440
 have a Buddhist monolith, one yana. This is an extreme approach. Some people really take

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:26.320
 that approach. One yana is called zogchen. There's only a single sphere of dharmadhātū

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:32.960
 or something like that. Don't need all these other techniques, concepts, rules, practices,

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:37.640
 nundras and all this stuff. Because I have this single sphere of dharmadhātū, I just

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:44.800
 need one yana. The great master, Vimalamitra, said he would be reborn every hundred years

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:55.840
 to correct exactly that mistake. As if zogchen is mere emptiness. It's not. So a very simple

00:30:55.840 --> 00:31:04.720
 direct way to say this that can be unpacked a lot is zogchen does not equal zen. The ninth

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:13.720
 yana is not the same as the third yana. It's obvious when you put it in a nine yana framework.

00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:22.160
 What's the big difference between zogchen and zen? That's a genuine question. This is the

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:27.160
 question that Vimalamitra comes back every hundred years to clarify. This is what Nyingma

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:31.920
 Buddhism has said in a long time. What's the difference between the third yana and the

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:41.000
 ninth yana? It's called the tantras. What is the primary difference between the third

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:47.400
 yana, bodhisattva yana, which includes wrongtong and shentong? Emptiness of self, emptiness

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:53.920
 of other, emptiness of self-fixation, emptiness of all the adventitious things clogging up

00:31:53.920 --> 00:32:00.520
 our Buddha nature. What happens after that? Pure body starts coming out. We start to see

00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:06.800
 pure body. Pure speech starts coming out. We start to see pure speech. That's called

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:17.600
 deity and mantra, otherwise known as tantra, because zen establishes pure mind just like

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:24.200
 in zogchen. That's what the great Madhyamaka middleweight teachings say. Pure mind is the

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:30.960
 same in third yana and the ninth yana. It's emptiness, great emptiness, but zogchen is

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:37.320
 not just emptiness. It's a union of relative and absolute, just like great Madhyamaka is

00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:44.200
 too, union of relative and absolute. Except the difference in great Madhyamaka, it's not

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:53.640
 pure relative yet. The tantras includes all the pure relative, all the way up to zogchen,

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:59.200
 and that's the big difference. It's quite different, impure body and pure body, impure

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:07.240
 speech and impure speech. Impure mind, sam, is like duality mind, monkey mind, and rigpa,

00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:16.920
 wisdom mind, jhana. It's very different. Zen has pure mind, zogchen has pure mind. What's

00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:24.240
 the difference? Great purity. It's called pure speech and pure body. That's the rubakaya,

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:32.160
 not just dharmakaya. That's why the Buddha taught all these tekpas, paths, yanas. I was

00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:36.840
 just happy to have the tremendously great fortune to be in Mexico, received teachings

00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:44.680
 from Zog's Art Cancer which is so astounding. He said, "If you do zogchen, you can't leave

00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:53.200
 out a single tekpa, not a single yana, not a single path, not a single way of communicating

00:33:53.200 --> 00:34:01.440
 with beings. Can it be the great completion if you leave out a single path?" It's not

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:06.640
 just the ninth path. It includes the eighth path, seventh, sixth, fifth, fourth, third,

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:12.440
 second, first. It includes everything, great completion. Venerable Ken Burmice, he said

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:21.520
 this, "Zogchen is like a dollar. All the yanas are like the coins that make up the dollar."

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:26.880
 That's why it's a great completion. It includes them all. It's not just the outermost ring

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:35.320
 or the single sphere. It's a single sphere that includes it all, all the other yanas,

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:41.000
 including Zen. It's the beating heart. It's bodhicitta, including renunciation mind, refuge.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:48.520
 That's called foundational Buddhism. It has to be included. These are like really core

00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:59.440
 teachings. That mistake has to also be corrected, not just hovering high in the sky saying big

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:04.680
 lofty rainbow-mouthed words, actually being on the ground in living experience, which

00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:08.800
 means you have to see what's my mind doing now, what's actually a skillful way to deal

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:13.120
 with it, who's around, what's available, how do I sync up with things in healthy living

00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:18.500
 lineage ways that actually honor the ecology of the lived what is happening right now in

00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:28.560
 real time. That's called lineage Nyayana Buddhism, not just high-level emptiness only talk, which

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:34.920
 in one simple way is just called anti-intellectualism. All these concepts, they get in the way of

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:39.720
 Rigpa, right? But for the Buddha, they didn't get in the way of his Rigpa at all. He was

00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:47.320
 able to speak, walk, talk, chew gum. Wisdom includes all the other techpas, yanas, approaches,

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:52.000
 skillful means. It's not just the emptiness ones because that's a whole thing in middle

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.720
 way. I'm kind of complaining. I'm not really complaining. These are actually serious things

00:35:56.720 --> 00:36:03.080
 that are mistakes happening in dharma, like they're mistakes, extreme views we can hold.

00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:08.640
 If you really get into middle way Madhyamaka, you don't prefer absolute over relative. That's

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:15.000
 like saying I'm a middle way person and I prefer nirvana over samsara. This is the exact

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:21.920
 thing that's being corrected in the middle way. Absolute and relative are the union.

00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:28.120
 If you actually go beyond all conceptual designation, you can't even say there's liberation because

00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:34.660
 there was never imprisonment. What do you mean nirvana? There is no such thing as samsara.

00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:40.320
 What do you mean many? There's not even one. If we really go beyond conceptual designation

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:46.600
 and we have this kind of wisdom as a stable abiding experience, then we'll include every

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:53.400
 single other dream of every single other being. If we just talk this way and we don't viscerally

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:59.600
 actually experience the utter flexibility or the emptiness, the openness, the fullness

00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:04.280
 of awareness when it's really not locking up and fixating, we're just talking about

00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:10.600
 it being free, but it's so clogged up in there. This is just dream talk. It doesn't help at

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:17.040
 all. It just makes you seem kind of like, you know, when you use your usual jerk habits,

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:21.320
 but you say nice, sweet, emptiness, spacious things. It makes people want to run away from

00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:29.400
 the dharma. Oh, look at this non-dual guy. It's almost always a white guy. It's almost

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:38.560
 always a guy. And they talk big emptiness things. Oh, big anti-intellectual things, which is

00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:47.000
 empty. Don't get so caught up in all these concepts, man. Just be here now, right? And

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:55.720
 then they very conveniently don't forget concepts like, you know, where's my salary? Where do

00:37:55.720 --> 00:38:02.540
 we go for vacation? These are all concepts in middle way, all this of concepts. If we

00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:08.280
 think we're trying to get somewhere for enlightenment, that's a concept. We're like, we're only

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:12.560
 want to hear nice words about ourselves. That's a concept. I mean, there's no even outside

00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:19.960
 out there in middle way. This is all sutra. There's not even an outside. What are you

00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:30.680
 even talking about? How's there even an inside? There's all these concepts. If we're really

00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:36.920
 abiding in that way, you know what we'll be like with people. We'll be so tender. Because

00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:42.760
 all these games and dreams and nightmares we're all creating for ourselves is so preventable.

00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:49.000
 It's just such an excruciating like, see, did you see it in these master's eyes? They see

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:54.240
 all this suffering beings go through and how they're doing all of it to themselves. It's

00:38:54.240 --> 00:39:00.760
 a complete self created mistake. There's no such thing as suffering for these noble ones.

00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:07.440
 They have such tender hearted bodhicitta kindness. And that's actually why they can be really

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:13.000
 clear too. Because when we start doing really disruptive things for ourselves, to each other,

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:18.540
 to the planet, to all these other species, like to some degree, the bodhisattva also

00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:24.400
 has to say, no, you can't just go around and murder people. And you have to go, I'm putting

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:29.640
 you in prison. Okay, it's there is no prison. There's no freedom because there's no imprisonment

00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:37.320
 and all that. But you're going to jail. There are such things as wrathful means that actually

00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:45.240
 stop super toxic, destructive, egoic, you know, obsession. Zrudra obsessions, my power,

00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:56.220
 my story, my truth, only me. There are such things. And that's also a very deep kindness.

00:39:56.220 --> 00:40:06.040
 That these masters like have to do. So that's overcoming extreme post postmodernism, or

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:10.520
 sometimes it's called integral, which I know for a lot of Buddhists are like very triggered

00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:19.800
 by that word. And I'm sorry about that, that you're so triggered. But it's like being triggered,

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:25.520
 you know, when I don't know, someone says something that's like not taught in a sutra

00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:30.920
 or tantra, and you get triggered. I mean, this is really such a fundamentalist approach

00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:37.680
 to Buddhism, that I'm just very sorry for actually, it's very sad. It's really sad to

00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:45.340
 me. Because it's so puritanical. And none of these great masters are like this. His

00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:49.440
 Holiness Dalai Lama has been going to these mind life conferences for 35 years learning

00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:56.160
 from the specialists of all different fields. And he humbly curiously listens to them talk.

00:40:56.160 --> 00:41:01.720
 And almost all the time, they never even there have no interest in what he says. They're

00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:06.840
 not there to learn about Buddhism for the most part. This is what participants say.

00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:10.840
 But His Holiness Dalai Lama keeps coming back. He's so fascinated to learn about all these

00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:15.600
 different ways human beings make sense. How they love, how they grieve, how they understand,

00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:21.600
 how they imagine. Why? Because he's a great bodhisattva. He wants to serve beings, play

00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:28.680
 as many games as you can, learn as many languages as you can. Gurumba Che did this in India.

00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:33.600
 He learned all the languages in India. That was like his time as a scholar in India. He

00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:37.840
 didn't just sit there in the charnel ground doing nothing. He did that too. He was in

00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:44.400
 samsara and out of samsara in the same time. In the box and out of the box. So this is

00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:51.600
 what kind of undoing this extreme habit to always only my box. My literalist fundamentalist

00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:59.680
 box. My rational hyper empirical box. My feelings only. My personal story. Listen to me in my

00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:05.740
 specific way box. My like bird's eye view, big system dynamic thinking, but never actually

00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:13.280
 be held accountable to a lineage, extreme box. Lineage Vajrayana Buddhism destroys all

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:22.440
 these boxes so kindly. Why? Because it loves all the good healthy aspects of those boxes.

00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:31.680
 Pre-modern box, family, integrity, character, hardworking, true to your word, honest, thorough,

00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:40.080
 caring of the land, future intergenerational worldviews, caring about other non-human beings

00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:46.360
 around you, spirits and animals. This is all pre-modern awesome stuff that will, you know

00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:53.440
 what happened? Unhealthy extreme modernism destroyed all that. But what did the healthy

00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:59.040
 modern thing do? It gave us science. It gave us literacy, human rights, women's rights,

00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:07.280
 LGBTQ plus rights. It gave us, you know, weekends and, you know, social security. I mean, modernism

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:13.400
 gave us world centric. We all won kumbaya, a single world vision of common humanity in

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:17.360
 a global view to see the environment as a single system and not just little nodes of

00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:22.960
 weather. This is all modern approach. How amazing. The Buddha taught this as verify

00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:29.720
 the teachings for yourself. The Buddha, I mean, the great Turthans always put back treasures

00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:33.320
 when they took out a term on because they didn't want to disturb the natural balance

00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:38.560
 of the environment. They were like 100% like world centric. We're all in this together

00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:42.640
 way beyond world centric. They're talking about other galaxies. They're loving other

00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:48.640
 beings of other kinds. We've never even seen our thought of. They're so beyond world centric,

00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:55.320
 even global. Just our planet. That's it. They're interplanetary. They're like inter universe

00:43:55.320 --> 00:44:01.640
 cycles. Postmodernism, how do they, the Buddha loved context. He loved plurality of views,

00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:06.360
 multiculturalism, contextualization. He called it interdependence. That's his core Buddhist

00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:13.840
 teaching. Everything depends. Dependent origination. The 12 links that Lai talked about just over

00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:20.080
 these past two sessions. Interdependence, it depends. This is called context sensitivity.

00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:25.760
 There's no one fixed way. There's no one size fits all Buddhism. There's many Buddhisms.

00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:30.840
 And then the healthy post postmodern way, not extreme healthy. How do all these systems

00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:36.520
 of sense making and love making and playing and imagining and grieving, like how do they

00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:41.840
 all fit together in large coherent pattern holes. This is like what the nine yana system

00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:52.800
 is all about. This is just core bedrock Buddhism. It's essential Buddhism. And the Buddha took

00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:57.320
 all the healthy aspects of these ways of making sense. Healthy pre-modern, healthy modern,

00:44:57.320 --> 00:45:02.720
 healthy postmodern, healthy postmodern, post postmodern. And he even went beyond that how

00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:09.800
 he even included all this stuff. Those views are not ready to deal with yet at all. And

00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:18.840
 we know what it's called, called tantra. Pure body and pure speech. And he gave millions

00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:24.440
 of teachings of the tantras. How do these other beings function? What are these subtle

00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:31.640
 ways of interdependence? How do these extra cognitive capacities of the mind turn on and

00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:36.520
 you get all these cities and these extraordinarily expansive, boomy realizations where you can

00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:41.920
 see way back in the past, way far into the future of probability trees of likelihood

00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:48.600
 and like cosmic, karmic habits. And I mean, way out of the box thinking, way beyond rationalism,

00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:54.880
 way beyond pluralism, way beyond big mapping according to what humans know currently according

00:45:54.880 --> 00:46:04.040
 to our science. He went so far beyond science and included science. This is all the tantras.

00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:11.000
 We have not grown into this culturally yet, but Buddha taught this 2,600 years ago. And

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:18.080
 that's just during this universe cycle. He's taught this so many times before. And the

00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:22.880
 because of all the past, present, and future, we'll keep teaching this Vajrayana teachings.

00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:27.280
 This is the best thing that ever happened on this planet. At the very least, it's one

00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:34.160
 thing that has gone way beyond anything we've conceived of yet, evolutionarily, in terms

00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:40.840
 of, definitely in terms of mainstream modern framing, including post-postmodernism or integral.

00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:45.440
 So these are the healthy ways. Dhrjum teresar nundra. This is like, pick a part of this

00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:52.520
 nundra. It pure, perfectly exemplifies this. Instantly, the space changes to be a giant

00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:56.320
 refuge tree with gurumba in the middle. All the Dharma teachings, all the Dharmapalas,

00:46:56.320 --> 00:47:01.040
 all the Dakinis, all the Arhats, all the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas of this whole fortunate eon.

00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:07.680
 Plus, your mom and your dad, your enemies, the strangers, every single. And this is actually

00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:12.960
 the actual lived experience that we're trying to be with right now. We're not trying to

00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:20.480
 paste it on our view, as if we're watching a movie. We're trying to viscerally, in an

00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:28.040
 embodied, totally interdependent way, be in the living mandala of gurumba in the refuge

00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:33.120
 tree with all this enlightened activity happening, with all our parents, and all the parents

00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:38.720
 of the three times, this like, totally in love with the Dharma, and they're just showering

00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:43.560
 down blessings on us. And we're trying to be in a state of mind, an openness of heart,

00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:50.160
 that viscerally is totally surrendered and 100% full on believing in this is the real

00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:57.000
 thing happening. That's called Vajrayana practice. That's so far beyond rationalization. It's

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:01.680
 so far beyond postmodernism. It's so far beyond integral. And there's whole lineage systems

00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:07.840
 of doing this. And none of them break the internal ecologies of one another. You get

00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:12.920
 the dudrum pterosaur nundro, bam, and then you can instantly arise as the karmakagyu

00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:19.720
 nundro tree. Then the long to ningtik nundro tree, in their entire world systems with their

00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:24.920
 own patterns, and dimensions, and shapes, and sizes, and sounds, and mantras, and lineage

00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:31.440
 instructions. And they're these entire vast landscapes, these whole worlds of actual patterned

00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:37.440
 integrity, that utterly perfectly work, and they can flex and flow between one another

00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:50.680
 instantly. This is Vajrayana. This is like way, there's just like open the doors wide.

00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:55.640
 The Vajrayana view is so vast, and this has been taught so thoroughly, and this is what

00:48:55.640 --> 00:49:01.080
 we're doing here all the time. I mean, I love going and being around friends and having

00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:06.280
 a good meal together and talking. I love that, that pre-modern, healthy, pro-social connection

00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:12.080
 humanness. That's good. But Vajrayana does a lot more than that. And I love science,

00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:17.480
 and thoroughness, and logical acuity, and like really going through the rigor. Vajrayana

00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:23.680
 does a lot more than that. And I love the felt sense story making, and genre bending,

00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:29.080
 and mashing up of different songs, and movies, and things. And Vajrayana does so much more

00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:35.320
 than that, without becoming like a total wasteland fragmented mess either. But like actual, these

00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:39.440
 internested ecologies of practice, where you get these internested philosophical systems

00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:45.800
 and these internested practice modalities. It's called the Nanyanas. And there's all

00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:50.920
 these interactive ways we can help beings that we don't know anything about yet, and other

00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:59.800
 planets by communicating them with colored light. Vajrayana, this is core Vajrayana stuff.

00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:03.720
 That's a big difference between Vajrayana and Sutra. We can actually serve beings through

00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:13.400
 light. That's a standard bedrock. That's a like, that's an orthodox Vajrayana view.

00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:19.080
 So I hope this is a little bit of like a fresh, kind of like a little freshness in the room.

00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:23.860
 There's so much freshness to be had. Vajrayana is such a vivid view. I mean, this new year's

00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:31.840
 opening, and it's another cycle. But here, yeah, another quote, and then I'll finish

00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:42.200
 from this poison is medicine. Dzogsar cancerimbiche. 229. "I feel that in the future, a non-Tibetan

00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:48.880
 teacher's single most important quality will be their longing to introduce the Buddha Dharma

00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:57.680
 to every single sentient being on this planet." They just love the Buddha Dharma. Another

00:50:57.680 --> 00:51:02.880
 quote, this is really good one, and then I'll really, this is a good one. You'll like this

00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:11.540
 one, and then I'll stop. Oh, there's so many good quotes in this. An abhishekha empowerment

00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:22.600
 is the one occasion in life that is truly worth celebrating. That's a strong one. Alright,

00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:37.480
 but this is the one I think you're really like. And then I'll be done, sorry. Oh yeah,

00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:45.920
 page 173. "A crystal clear understanding of the view will provide you with an easily accessible

00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:53.120
 safe haven. No matter what expression changes in any way, no matter what has to adapt, the

00:51:53.120 --> 00:52:00.040
 crystal clear understanding of the view will provide you with an easily accessible safe

00:52:00.040 --> 00:52:08.920
 haven." It's still not the final quote. That's the last one, sorry. Okay, here it is. 229.

00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:37.880
 Sorry for the multimedia thing. It's just 21st century now. Now we get to juggle all

00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:46.800
 of that. Okay, here it is. Yeah, good. This is page 229, yeah. This is good. Alright,

00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:51.280
 and then this is a conclusion. Thank you. "A teacher's genuine concern for the Dharma

00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:57.520
 is often their most attractive quality. Experts can be impressive when it comes to presenting

00:52:57.520 --> 00:53:04.600
 facts, theories, and complicated philosophies. But the person who has the most effect is

00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:11.800
 the tireless volunteer who serves coffee after a Dharma talk and then goes out of her way

00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:17.280
 to introduce new people to the expert. Her palpable enthusiasm for and conviction in

00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:23.640
 the Dharma is infectious and most of us respond better to unvarnished, unselfish, heartfelt

00:53:23.640 --> 00:53:31.240
 enthusiasm than to endless lists and definitions. As we try to draw more people's attention

00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:37.840
 to the Dharma, please try to embody the kind of irresistible enthusiasm and concern that

00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:45.280
 others find so attractive. I feel that in the future, a non-Tibetan teacher's single

00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:49.600
 most important quality will be their longing to introduce the Buddha Dharma to every single

00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:54.880
 sentient being on this planet. I have met many practitioners over the years who embody

00:53:54.880 --> 00:54:01.940
 this quality, but they are rarely Buddhist teachers, authors, scholars, professors, or

00:54:01.940 --> 00:54:07.880
 Buddha Dharma-promoting yoga teachers. More often than not, it is the single working mother

00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:14.720
 of three whose longing to connect everyone she knows with the Buddha Dharma is so intense

00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:19.920
 that she willingly goes the extra mile to spread the word. This kind of enthusiasm does

00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:27.080
 more for Buddha Dharma than all the Buddhist professionals on the planet. The luxury of

00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:32.020
 anonymity and not having a Dharma title to live up to or the responsibilities to maintain

00:54:32.020 --> 00:54:37.580
 may also help. Enthusiastic volunteers have the ability to communicate one-to-one with

00:54:37.580 --> 00:54:44.360
 friends and loved ones without seeming overbearing or dogmatic. I always include them in my prayers

00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:53.520
 for the long life of the Dharma holders. We are all a part of this living lineage tradition,

00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:58.350
 but the only way we can love it with enthusiasm and not make it just be another empire

00:54:58.350 --> 00:54:59.360
 fundamentalist

00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:05.940
 religion, which the Buddha never taught, is to love it in a way that is not all filtered

00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:12.960
 to all these extreme views. It's not only the only way for everyone, but it's so lovely.

00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:17.880
 The Buddha Dharma is just so magical and lovely and scientific, rational, such a coherent

00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:23.760
 philosophical system. It's a really rewarding way of life. It's hard. The path is hard,

00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:28.000
 but choosing samsara and all the negative emotions and just kind of splattering them

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:33.680
 around is so much harder. It's endless. But if we do a little bit of the hard work of

00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:39.560
 churning kind of the milk of our own kind of path, we will really get the butter or the

00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:44.440
 cream. We'll actually get the reward of freedom, of happiness, long lasting happiness for the

00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:50.160
 benefit of all beings. This is really possible. It's very actionable. It's super practical.

00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:55.280
 The higher we go into these teachings, the more we include on the path, the more elegant

00:55:55.280 --> 00:56:03.040
 the path becomes. We can include more in these distilled kind of compact, essential nuggets,

00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:06.800
 which are called pith instructions. If we let those pith instructions of these higher

00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:12.280
 tantras, of zogchen and the tantras, if we really let them resonate and change the fundamental

00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:20.160
 ways that we hold ourselves as being so stuck and so fixed and so removed from interdependence,

00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:25.920
 if we really let the power of the blessing of those pith instructions really change us,

00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:31.600
 soften us, challenge us, then we really can become enlightened in this life. All the teachings

00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:37.000
 say that, and this really is so possible. Our great masters are living examples of what

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:42.840
 happens when you really mingle with the Dharma. So thank you. This is a little longer. Appreciate

00:56:42.840 --> 00:56:51.120
 it. Hope it's not too harsh and strong, but it's with love for myself too. These are all

00:56:51.120 --> 00:57:06.000
 hard habits to break, so may I break them in a very elegant, lovely way? Yes. Thank you.

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:14.360
 Could I do a quick summary? Really quick? Yes. So I know there might be really concern,

00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:20.800
 like bringing up extreme views, that I'm like adding my own extreme views by mentioning

00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:26.000
 like non-Dharma kind of categories, like pre-modern, modern, post-modern, post-post-modern, and

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:31.560
 that's a very legitimate concern. This concern is how the Buddha Dharma has stayed like a

00:57:31.560 --> 00:57:39.680
 living lineage for over 2,600 years. The great Kabjai Tinlinor Burmichhe, he said in his

00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:49.960
 book, recent book, the Ruby Rosary, he said to change a single line of the Dharma is worse

00:57:49.960 --> 00:58:00.640
 than intentionally murdering all of the sentient beings in the universe. So I think I can assure

00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:09.680
 you I'm really concerned about not having the Dharma get messed up. This is a genuine

00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:18.720
 concern of mine. So then where's all this coming from? We can really look at the sutras,

00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:25.000
 the Buddha's Theravada teachings, sutra of inexhaustible knowledge. This is where the

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:34.440
 Buddha taught the four alliances. He said don't rely on the teacher, rely on the teaching.

00:58:34.440 --> 00:58:41.800
 Don't rely on the words, rely on the meaning. Don't rely on the provisional meaning, rely

00:58:41.800 --> 00:58:52.060
 on the definitive meaning. Don't rely on conceptual mind, rely on wisdom. If we really look at

00:58:52.060 --> 00:58:58.200
 this, he's showing us the view we need to take and how we refine it by giving up extreme

00:58:58.200 --> 00:59:07.500
 views the same sequence that we went through today. Don't rely on the teacher, the teaching,

00:59:07.500 --> 00:59:12.360
 that's like saying don't rely on the doctor, rely on the medicine. This is giving up literal

00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:19.160
 fundamentalism. Just believe the person. He said no. Look at what they said in terms of

00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:25.200
 the medicine. That's called science. Then he said don't just stay on the surface level

00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:33.800
 of science. Don't rely on the words, rely on the meaning. There's layers of science.

00:59:33.800 --> 00:59:40.400
 There's layers of nuance. Don't be fundamentalist about just the phrase or the word of the rational

00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:47.800
 one system. There's multiple systems. That's called healthy postmodernism. But don't rely

00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:56.100
 on the provisional meaning. Rely on the definitive, which means all the teachings go towards

00:59:56.100 --> 00:59:56.640
 absolute

00:59:56.640 --> 01:00:05.800
 truth are wisdom, the definitive teaching. So definitive teaching absolute is unchanging.

01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:11.680
 It is not a static, oppressive, relative, universalizing structure. That's unchanging

01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:18.520
 wisdom. But we can't just talk about this using conceptual mind. We can't rely on conceptual

01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:25.000
 mind, but actual wisdom awareness. Don't just stay above the teachings talking about the

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:31.440
 big maps. Actually have to be in a state of rigpa. Have to be in post-conceptual, non-conceptual

01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:37.880
 wisdom awareness. And then engage all the suffering nightmares and dreams of sentient

01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:43.320
 beings. This is like going beyond post-postmodern. It actually has to be a lived experience, which

01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:48.240
 then includes the Tantras. And that's how you get the fullness of Dzogchen, the great

01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:54.960
 perfection to include all those that was outlined by the Buddha in the Sutras. This is all straight

01:00:54.960 --> 01:01:02.840
 up. Bedrock Buddhism. And the Sutras, the most exoteric. So it's important always to locate

01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:08.920
 where these teachings are coming from, and with specific examples. And this is really

01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:13.820
 so important, always vitally important to do this. So we're not losing track of what's

01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:19.040
 essence and mixing it up with what's kind of expression. Thank you.
