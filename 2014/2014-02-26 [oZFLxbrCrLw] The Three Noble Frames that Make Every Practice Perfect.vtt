00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.960
 Meditation, vipasyana meditation, or union of the vipasyana, shamatha meditation with visualization

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.640
, completion stages, practices, the teaching we apply now, teaching apply.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:19.920
 That teaching, what we practice is the visualization, Dzogchen meditation, or the shamatha

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.040
 meditation.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:31.600
 What it is, that essence is, is the bodhicappa, essence is love, essence is joy, essence is

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.360
 thinking of all living beings, essence is devotion.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:45.660
 That is what the practice, both the revitalization, the shamatha, vipasyana meditation, Dzogchen

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.460
 meditation, really becomes so special because it starts with that beautiful religion at the same

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.880
 flavor, same quality, same nutrition.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:59.770
 It's with that, that, then it becomes so special. So that is known as the second novel, without

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:06.530
 grasping, without clinging, relaxing on the natural status, or abiding on the natural status, with

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:15.060
 the relaxing atmosphere, with calm, peace, joy, yet not distracted from the points and keeping up

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.800
 that flame, keeping up that light, beautiful.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:28.240
 And then that is known as the second novel, the middle or the medium novels, the principal novels.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:34.480
 And once we're going to concur with their practices, and then is the third novel.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:44.130
 Third novel is commonly known as dedication and aspiration practices. Dedication and aspiration

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.960
 practice is the final novel. It's the Phoenician touch.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.850
 Now you've built up beautiful things, started with the beautiful foundation, beautiful structure,

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:54.960
 beautiful things.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:02.340
 Now we're going to concur with that with Phoenician touch. Phoenician touch is dedication and

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.240
 aspiration practice.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:11.520
 What is that? Dedication and aspiration practice. And again, it's no other than joy, appreciation,

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.000
 and bodhicitta. Bodhicitta.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.160
 And because of that, we think everyone with joy, peace, happiness, what we did.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.590
 Thinking of your practice, meditation, what you did, did, and also meditation practice that what

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.000
 you did in the past.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.170
 Even if we didn't remember now in the Buddha teaching, he said in the past lives we did a lot of

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.560
 good activities, good activities.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.300
 That's what we are now here, like beautiful beings. All those beautiful, bring the past to virtuous

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.200
 activity,

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:48.000
 and gather all the present righteous activities, and the future of what you are going to plan to do

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.000
,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.960
 or what may going to happen, some of the beautiful activities on the next lines, definitely.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:02.000
 Bring up those mentally all protogonal and become that, become the cause.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.720
 May this become the great cause to bring the joy and peace, happiness for all living beings.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.840
 Remove their suffering, the difficult troubles, and cause of suffering, the difficult troubles,

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:20.560
 and have always ignited, always glorified cause of joy and peace, happiness.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.320
 May that. So that, wishing for the cause and the result.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:33.600
 Whether wishing for the, or dedicating for the cause, dedicating the merit for the cause and the

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.080
 result.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:41.040
 That means again, dedicating merit to remove the cause of suffering, and suffering itself.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:47.520
 Dedicating the merit to bring up the cause of joy and peace, happiness to every living beings,

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:53.520
 and for the peace and happiness, happiness. And what is the cause of suffering difficulties?

00:03:53.520 --> 00:04:03.760
 And that is, the all the negative emotions, the all the poisons, is cause of suffering.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:12.880
 All the poisons, ignorance, attachment, anger, jealous, hated thoughts, doubt, and hesitation.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:21.840
 Those are the fundamental, the primary cause of sufferings, difficulties.

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.640
 And what is the cause of happiness and joy and peace? It's both each other.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:37.600
 Simple way to tell. Love, kindness, compassion, detachment, appreciation, rejoice.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:43.920
 And wisdom, intelligence, wisdom that brings up true naturals.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:50.240
 Those are the cause of the happiness, cause of the peace, cause of the harmonious,

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:56.480
 cause of good environments, and cause of the Buddhahood, of course, I mean surely.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:01.360
 Therefore, dedicated that wish, merit to pull those causes.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:08.880
 At the same time, aspirations may become everyone's enlightenment, may everyone have joy and peace,

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.640
 happiness, and may immediately remove their suffering and difficulties.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:18.640
 Wishing all the good thoughts. That is known as aspirations.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.520
 Aspiration in the debate is called monom.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:27.360
 It's your wishing that, you express that, sincerely from our heart.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.760
 This is also known as know that wishing both each other. We had both.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.000
 Both each other has true. Wishing both each other, actualizing both each other.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.360
 Wishing both each other. It's true. It is all true from your heart.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.720
 It's not pretending, not lip services. My father used to say, "From where you're talking?"

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.680
 He said, "From talking here, or talking here, or talking here."

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.320
 That means it's just a lip service. Just talking on here.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:01.440
 But he said, "If talks here, if you talk here, it's true. That is it.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.400
 We're talking here. We're waking from here."

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.120
 Therefore, it's so unique, so special.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.440
 This is known as the three frames of the practices.

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.920
 Three noble frames.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:19.600
 As I said, if we like to make the practice noble, then this is very noble.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:24.640
 If we apply this, his whole teaching with these three frames,

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.920
 which is already that, is not exclusive, is there,

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:32.080
 and add that in those portrait of four wealth of Dharma,

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:37.200
 then truly we will become very beautiful beings on this earth.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:43.520
 We will become one of the some of the shining stars in the beautiful galaxy of the samsara bowl.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:50.560
 Not just only that, but that star that's going to continue to shine along all our journeys.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:57.200
 All the way to the enlightenment, then we become one of the biggest stars, stars.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.240
 And that's how this practice goes.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:04.960
 So that is my, just a reminder, again, practices and now.
