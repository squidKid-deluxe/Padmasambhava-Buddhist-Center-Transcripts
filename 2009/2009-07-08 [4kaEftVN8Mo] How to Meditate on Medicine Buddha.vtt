00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.350
 This means that you can benefit or to cure the disease, as mentioned in the Buddha's teaching, the

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.640
 substance, and the mantra, and the meditation.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:20.870
 Among these three, this practice of Medicine Buddha is the mantra and the meditation topic, and so

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.180
 therefore it is very special.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:29.360
 In particular, this practice is then very special practice that is the blessing, combined,

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.300
 triggered, or blessings from Khyendarachta,

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.440
 as well as from Guru Padmasambha, combined, triggered in one single state.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:45.200
 This was then discovered by a great tekung, Modyotogi, and edited by this another great master, R

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.140
aga Asye.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.790
 So it is a combination of many blessed, blessed world, blessed healing, blessed, really combined

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.980
 with this Medicine Buddha practice.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:00.110
 So it is one of the very, very special practices of the Medicine Buddha, and that existing and in

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.560
 it a bit, and this is now.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:08.840
 And therefore, we should really practice this. Whenever we have time, practice with both joy, and

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.300
 devotion, and confidence, then we should practice on this Medicine Buddha practices.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.450
 And then Medicine Buddha practices, and when it comes to the self, as you see here, that we can do

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.180
 two meditations, as we utilize our self as Medicine Buddha,

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:31.140
 and then we utilize Medicine Buddha right also in front of you, another Medicine Buddha, or we

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.980
 utilize our self as Medicine Buddha,

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:44.730
 the sakhaikala or the laposlajikala of Medicine Buddha, and then the seven other Medicine Buddhas,

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.060
 surrounded by this Medicine Buddha,

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:54.150
 which is your self as Medicine Buddha, and surrounded by the seven other medicine Buddhas, right in

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.100
 front of you.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.020
 And then place where you utilize the meditation, since you have utilized your self as Medicine

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.820
 Buddha or Medicine Buddha is right in front of you,

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.870
 then this universe is the world where we are, is also not just a regular world of the universe, but

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:11.380
 it is land of the Medicine Buddha,

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:19.850
 land of the healing, the ex-Christa pure land, or pure land of upon pleasure to sing, sing the

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.180
 pleasure, that tantra pure land.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:28.210
 Everything is a healing, healing place, everything is completely healed, all the state of the

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.340
 enlightenment, healing energy.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:37.550
 Feel that presence, and then we will utilize our self, medicine Buddha, with all these latinos and

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.420
 all these mandalas, as you mentioned there.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:46.300
 And as we were within that with great confidence and very, like that meditative concentrate status,

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:52.830
 and then you can act as in sadness, from the heart center of the home silver, began to emanate a

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:53.860
 lateral blue light,

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.530
 and as well as all the other latinos, went every direction of the pure land, particularly to the

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.020
 east land, pure land of the medicine Buddha,

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:08.210
 invoked his blessings, all the medicine Buddha, all their blessings, completely triggered them, and

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:09.500
 blessed the healing power.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.940
 All that came as a writing to you, in a way, and pulled to your three places.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:21.260
 Body, speech, mind, or from chakra, sweet chakra and heart chakra, and that moment even your

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:28.450
 meditation or your power is more kind of ignited, more glorified within that medicine Buddha status

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:28.460
.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:34.460
 And with that medicine Buddha, and then you can make all those kind of ritual ceremony praise.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.810
 As it mentioned, the text clearly very beautiful in the colloquial style, we do these ceremony

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:45.750
 practices in order to accommodate and to marry, or to fulfill the completely to marry that which

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.780
 will benefit our self to the old beings through strong persons.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:57.110
 And then the recited these mantras. Mantra, and then as we recited the mantra continually emanating

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.660
, lateral healing light and blessing light,

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:05.260
 then going to all the different directions, and then heal everyone, every sickness, their troubles,

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:13.450
 all their sickness and unbalance of the body and mind, completely cleared with and uprooted, even

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:19.180
 the cause of the disease, as we discussed, ignorance and attachment, anger, all the negative

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.340
 patterns, completely cleared with that.

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:32.860
 So when this blue light comes, the blue light goes, it contains the every healing power.
