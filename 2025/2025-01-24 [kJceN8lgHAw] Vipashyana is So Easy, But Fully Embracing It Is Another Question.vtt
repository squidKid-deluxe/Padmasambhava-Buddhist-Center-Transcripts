00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.440
 And then we go to the bed 11, and the bed 11, and I think it's the last line of the bed 11.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.880
 I think we went through yesterday and this time, so let's let it roughly.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.360
 As I said to you, and you all know, and this is the Haysonden, or Haysonden, do you remember?

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:35.520
 Haysonden was told as a graduation rate with instruction only out of the teaching of the

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:43.200
 how to develop, graduate, and then bring the realization of the Dzogchen.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:50.520
 This is the one that we should practice as. We're all not the highly culpable and instant

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.720
 persons. The highly culpable and practicing, they don't have to go graduation, they instantly

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:06.480
 touch to the goal of the nature. Even we receive the teaching of the most powerful, the mostly

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:12.400
 kind of nugget Dzogchen teaching, but yet, when it comes to the practice, we have to

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:20.000
 follow, follow graduation rates as in the meditation here, with the mindfulness of the

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:31.760
 poor point of the training of the mind, and poor mindfulness. Those are gradually established,

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:37.680
 and those I said, and I'm not just I said, and teaching said, those are shamatha meditation.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:46.160
 Shamatha meditation is a foundation of all the practices, all the meditations. With all

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:54.080
 the good foundation of the shamatha, the meditations won't come. Because with meditation, we can

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:02.400
 resume the teaching, so teaching is all that, but won't click so easily. Really, it was

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:10.050
 difficult to understand it. It's kind of difficult. Even we are following the threats and the

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.640
 teaching

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:17.760
 still couldn't kind of figure out that, that's what the Vibhachana is. It's very

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:24.400
 according to the teaching, and when we will go through the teaching, Vibhachana is so easy,

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:36.880
 so simple, so easy. But yet, when it comes to our, to handle that, to conduct everything that,

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:48.080
 always cannot, cannot be easy. Easy. Why? Because we don't have good foundation of the

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:55.840
 shamatha meditation. Also, we don't have good foundation of the medituri activities.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:05.600
 Also, we don't have maybe, not really like, devotions. Devotions and medituris and Vibhachana,

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:13.440
 sorry, shamatha meditation are the fundamental and essential to actualize the realizations.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:20.640
 Realizations, really in the teaching, all those great masters,

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:32.000
 they've been great practitioners, very great practitioners, full of joy and love and compassion,

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:41.600
 practicing all those accumulation practices, Vibhach, shamatha meditations, and as well as

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:48.000
 all such bundle of practices. Bundle of practices is known as khanu, the translated as

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:57.600
 preliminary practices, but that is just not preliminary, preliminary. It is the practice,

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:06.880
 that practice will lead as a realization of the zochen, our own true nature. Really, it will help

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:14.160
 because we accommodate the medituri. What medituri? Two medituri, accommodate the medituri,

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:21.440
 what's the medituri? Look at the teaching, of course, of zocchi teachings and all those teachings,

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:30.640
 Mahabharata teachings, ah, ah, we listen, it is wonderful, beautiful, but the realization is not

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:43.040
 so easy because our medituri is strong enough, and our devotion is not strong enough, and then also

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.400
 khamatha meditation is not strong enough. Those are the really reason in the teaching method.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:58.160
 We have all those quite good, really quite highlighted scholars. Then,

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:06.800
 realization comes so easily in the great master, Sara, I say, realization of the, after the truth

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:14.400
 of the zocchi, realize that you come to discover, really, from your one's own palm hand,

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:21.760
 one's own hand. Discovery is here, right here. Enlightenment is not coming from somewhere,

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:31.120
 coming, or it is going to be handed by someone. Someone, but right here, really. But why even

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:38.640
 though it's right here, we don't recognize, or we don't discover that because of those.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:48.560
 What I say, why that, why all that need? Because, again, the same answer, because of the dualities

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:58.480
 and obscurations, grasping, clinging, the habit of heaven, that each of us created

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:06.000
 from the biggest times, is completely sealed with that. Now, to claim with that, we have to claim,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:14.480
 we need both, both supporters, medituri supporters. Akumalayhi marriage was the married supporters.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:21.440
 We need, to activate Akumalayhi marriage support, we need shammata. We need devotions.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.920
 Devotions and shammat are relative truth.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:39.840
 Devotions is conception, pain is consumption, and shammata, as I said, and you know too,

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:45.440
 I, is the conception. But this conception is something different.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:54.400
 Consultants that will dispel the unhealthy conceptions. Unhealthy conceptions,

00:06:54.400 --> 00:07:00.960
 obstacle conceptions, hairdresser conceptions, blockage conceptions, illegal claim, and that.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:10.080
 And also, we're already changing. The calmness, even though shammata is a conception, devotion is

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:18.880
 conception. But come next, call it of that shammata, call it of that devotions, aa, drone of the,

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:31.840
 our nature of the mind, drone, d-a-w-n-a, drone of light, the morning light of the enlightenment.

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:40.800
 Even though it is a conception, it is ready. So when we kind of touch to that light and go through

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:48.640
 that light, we will discover the sun of the Buddha enlightenment within from our heart.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:55.680
 Those are in the teaching manual, manual, that all the great masters mentioned. So with this

00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:02.160
 understanding, and now, and following these lines up, there's three lines.
