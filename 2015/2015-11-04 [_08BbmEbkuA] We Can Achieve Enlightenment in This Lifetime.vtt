00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.240
 Rinpoche teaches the highest teaching, the most essential teaching, most powerful teachings,

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.280
 and we have the dedication and joyful effort and courage and commitment, and we really

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.800
 observe this teaching in the heart and not linger in too many different directions. Truly we will

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:19.200
 get

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.960
 enlightenment within this lifetime. That's the teaching. So many people, the individuals reach

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:36.000
 enlightenment in that realization status in that status. And in the teaching said, three years,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.960
 six years, twelve years, those are the reviews of the teaching series. So if you practice it,

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.640
 for example, of course, Longchenpa is highly enlightened beings. I was sovereign when I was

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:55.360
 taught the word in this world. But through his research with the teaching and I dedicated his

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:02.130
 practice to the teaching that what he received from his root teacher, Rizikumar Raza, everyone said

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.160
 he

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.160
 reached enlightenment within six years. Also he said he's going to make the offering of the

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:14.400
 practice and offering to his teachers. In an external level, Longchenpa was not rich. Not rich,

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.000
 there's nothing to material offering to that he can make to the teacher, upper receiver, all those

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 teachings, those profound teaching of Zoki. But he said I will make the practices and practice it

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.640
 and that will make offering for you. And as he did this and he practiced for six years,

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.000
 and three years or six years, and within that he reached enlightenment. And so many people,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.400
 and in Youngchenpa practiced about three years, three years, and then he become one of the great

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.760
 yogi and enlightened beings in the Tibetan Buddhist history stories. I mean, there's just so many

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.000
 people

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.600
 put that because why they really reach enlightenment? Why they because they're because their joy,

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:04.880
 their devotions, their bodhicata, their apohek is siddhala, is the praise, is not heading way,

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.600
 start with something beautiful, nice and kind of excitement, and then just kind of heading way.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:17.840
 That is not every day they're renewed, every moment they're renewed, that sizzling thoughts.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.280
 Read life story as I said the other day, and life story of those great masters,

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.440
 how much they have devotions, how much they have compare of bodhicatas,

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:33.760
 how much they have joy and applications, and courage and commitments, and also

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.520
 nutemity, kind of like so much this and that things alter, but really courage and commitment,

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.240
 confidence. When you are kind of observe the teaching like that, and observe that,

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:49.600
 and preserve that teaching with that, and practice it, then truly it will break the result.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.520
 Even we sleep for one hour, kind of good meditation practice, we see some difference,

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:02.160
 our stop. Even we have so heavy all these things, even one hour, or how hour we could practice

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.880
 meditation,

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:09.040
 kind of good one, sizzling energy, sizzling college, really it makes difference, difference.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.080
 I mean this is not just how we talk it, this is the universal proof, I mean now I'm modern time,

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.750
 and now these days so many minds were meditating, so that's happening, because they see some

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:20.560
 benefit,

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.400
 that work, how much they meditate, three minutes, three minutes, maybe 15 minutes,

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.800
 kind of hands all together, stay quiet and peaceful, even that bread resolved.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:41.520
 I mean these tell us, therefore this joy and respect and appreciation, I mean all this what I

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:48.320
 said, this is so important, with this zobti teaching or the vegayana teaching, we put that together

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.320
,

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:54.670
 truly, really we will get, make the difference, we will get, and as great master Padra Ramayana

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.880
 said,

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:00.720
 if you didn't get enlightened in these lifetimes, truly you will be one of the happiest and most

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:07.440
 contented and peaceful journey of persons in the lives, and leave this world with that same manner,

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:14.720
 same quality, with joy and happy and peaceful, not regret and not feel bad and this and that things

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.720
,

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:24.000
 and truly kind of like looking forward, forward the next one, truly that way, and no fears,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.800
 no afraid, no scared, truly that's what the by the practice, so this all nearly comes, this the

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:36.240
 practice and that teaching, that what these great masters practice, that's what we've been

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.120
 discussed,

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:43.920
 we follow their struggles, one after another, great master, master Shabwa Taururanda, bought the

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:50.560
 teachings of Lomchimpa, teachings of Dhyunbi Lomba, teachings of his root teacher, and applied his

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:50.960
 own

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:58.160
 experience and nuggetly sharing this teaching to us, how we can activate it, boost our realizations

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:58.160
,

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.960
 understand, so that's what the teaching is.
