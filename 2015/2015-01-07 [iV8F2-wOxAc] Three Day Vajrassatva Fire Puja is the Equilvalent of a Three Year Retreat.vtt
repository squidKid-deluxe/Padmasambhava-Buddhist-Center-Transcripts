00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.160
 One of the times, here it is, a great opportunity to really do practice this. It's a very special

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:12.400
 practice we had this year, an opportunity to do three times, I think, three days, actually.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:18.640
 Three days, same thing as a three-day retreat. In Buddhism, they always talk about all the Vedayana

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.400
 teachings.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:27.240
 So the practice is three days, one week, 21 days, one month, and then, of course, a long and a

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.400
 three years, and then 12 years, and so forth.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.400
 I think we are practicing three days, three days, equivalent of a three-year retreat.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:49.400
 It's short and quick, but condensed as an American style. Thank you. Thank you everyone for coming.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:56.080
 Now we get up and going to handhelds together and join the parade, and last night they did what's

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.400
 called a big apple drop, and everybody excited.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.400
 So much jumping up and high, and we do it today, second time.
