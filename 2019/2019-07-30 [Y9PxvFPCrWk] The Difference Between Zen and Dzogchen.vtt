00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:29.080
 I think, of course, I did not really start it about Zen or do it too much, but the Zen

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:40.040
 meditation is definitely very similar with Dzogchen meditations, because it's a similar

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:50.280
 way, I'm talking about the same as the emptiness. Emptiness meditation is very similar, because

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:59.140
 the Zen meditation is immediately pointing out, such as emptiness mind or no mind, so

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:08.600
 going to direct to the emptiness aspect of the mind. In that way, true teaching, true

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:15.440
 teaching and then teaching, and as well as Mahamudra teaching, I think it's close, very

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:23.680
 close, I think it's teaching, I don't see any big difference there, that is my understanding.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:33.240
 So true teaching and then teaching, so maybe it's similar, similar, so that is my, an aligned

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:43.600
 or my understanding. Then, what would the difference be in terms of, because Zen is usually like

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:50.600
 bodhisattva yana, and then the bodhisattva yana, and then Dzogchen is like ati-yoga yana,

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:58.920
 so what's the difference in terms of the practice of it? And the difference a bit of the techniques

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:06.040
 and the way they started this practice at Zen, again I don't really know too much about

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:14.640
 the Zen, started that, but Zen is more purpose, kind of my understanding, of course you can

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.600
 correct me, you all can correct me, but my understanding is more purpose on the emptiness

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:28.120
 aspect, emptiness, emptiness, and that such is like the poem is the emptiness, sound is the

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.680
 emptiness,

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:35.000
 A is the emptiness, every aggregate is the emptiness, which is, I mean the Buddha teaching,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.480
 which is true, true, I mean it's very direct, Mahayan teachings, so it's more purpose on the

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:51.240
 emptiness aspect of that, and according also my understanding, maybe Zen is not purely in the

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.800
 Buddha's teaching, they've always told, according to very Buddhist, they've always told, skill

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:03.400
 means aspect of teaching, and the wisdom aspect of teaching, so Zen is more purpose on the wisdom

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:10.860
 aspect of teaching, more wisdom aspect of teaching, so it is the emptiness, emptiness teaching,

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:11.280
 there's

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:18.800
 no ego, no I, I mean all that, it's kind of more focus on that, and it's very Buddhism, and Zouki

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:25.360
 teaching is also, that is the purpose too, but at the same time, focus on the skill means aspect

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:32.800
 of teaching, which is, if I say what is that, and it is like compassion, companion aspect of the

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:39.840
 teaching practices, because in Zouki teaching, Zouki teaching said, have you practiced only on the

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:48.480
 emptiness aspect, which is true that, but you're in a little bit neglecting that, the skill aspect

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.160
 of nature of the mind, or nature, the art nature of the mind, skill means aspect of nature of mind

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:01.040
 is compassion, flowing kindness, have you neglected that, that then, I mean it's just you focus on,

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:09.440
 but you focus, kind of neglected others, and then it's not full, kind of like as Zouki teaching,

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:17.280
 that is not complete practices, so therefore, the skill aspect of the teaching is more focus,

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:24.720
 according with that, then in Zouki, or to be the general Buddhism, and the Shattarakha pose,

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:30.240
 Shattarakha teaching, then this is called two accumulation practice, that which is really

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:40.110
 emphasize that accumulation, so wisdom and merit, accumulation merit, wisdom merit is then med

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.560
itating

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:50.800
 on the emptiness, that is the wisdom, but this, the accumulation merit is then practicing on the

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:57.440
 all the six, among six parameters is practicing on the generosity, moralities, and concentrations,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:06.160
 and patience in your effort, and all that is the moral, the accumulation merit, so this two merit

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:12.560
 is so important, and that is like the Shattarakha pose, and that is an original pose, and that is

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.880
 also

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:19.120
 in the Buddha teaching, if you don't have the both, two, two accumulations, and then you cannot fly

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:29.120
 to direct the sky or make the enlightenment, because you're missing this accumulation merit,

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:36.400
 which is you're missing one, in order to fly perfectly in the sky, you need two wings,

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:42.480
 and you're missing one big wing, that won't happen, and therefore, that is the great Master

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:50.000
 Jandar Kirti also said in his teaching, there's need two wings to reach or to glide, or to the

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.840
 state of the dharmakaya, so those are the, I think it's a little different, in the zouki teaching,

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:06.960
 that is again, in the two level, that is then similar, but then it's not just only that zouki

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:15.520
 focus, the only that in the focus, also in skillful aspect of the aspect, and which is also clarity

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:22.640
 aspect of the nature of the mind, so then keep bring up more, and that, a colon teaching,

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:31.440
 that makes them very perfect, full, full discovery, full quality of the nature of the mind.

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.720
 thank you okay yeah
