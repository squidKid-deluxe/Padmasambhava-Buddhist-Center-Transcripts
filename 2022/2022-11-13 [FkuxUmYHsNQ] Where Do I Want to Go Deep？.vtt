00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.200
 Thank you, friends. Thank you, friends, Dharma sisters, brothers. Thank you so much. What

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.360
 a special opportunity. Once again, we have the fortune to be together in this way virtually

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:25.480
 or in person to really contemplate and connect to the living Dharma, the nature of reality,

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:31.800
 the nature of ourselves, so kind of bringing that up actively, vividly in my own mind and

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.300
 in our minds, like this deep joy and appreciation. Always, this is like for me to get to kind

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:43.050
 of say something about Dharma, it's like almost is just kind of sometimes excruciatingly

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:43.800
 embarrassing.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:51.800
 It's like I'm really nervous. It's just such a big responsibility. And to just reflect

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.080
 on this vast and profound teachings of the Buddha and the Guru Rinpoche and all these

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:04.440
 masters. So we know, like, there will be good if we just kind of pause to reflect on what

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.480
 they said, even if we just repeat the words of the Buddha, repeat the words of Guru Rinpoche

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:17.520
 of these masters, these living lineage masters, and then there's such great immense benefit.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.400
 So then we're kind of doing that. And then for me personally, it's like really humbling

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.320
 and I think, how can I like be receptive to this? And then I really think of how Venerable

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.160
 Kemper Rinpoche always points us to this. And so did Venerable Kenshin Pauld and Cher

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.880
 Rinpoche and all these lineage masters, these three qualities that we should actively kind

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.720
 of ignite in our own minds whenever we're going to study or practice the Dharma. These

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:50.920
 three qualities we've heard so many times, renunciation, bodhicitta, and pure perception.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.960
 Especially in the context of coming together to practice and contemplate the nundra or

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.920
 the foundational teachings in this Vajrayana view and these teachings taught by the Buddha

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.960
 and Guru Rinpoche. So always we should have these three frameworks as a living experiences

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.040
 in our mind as much as we can. If not just during this brief window, we're trying to

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:15.920
 really reignite them, vividly have them kind of saturate our mind stream, like come to

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.400
 life as a living presence, this renunciation, bodhicitta and pure perception. So renunciation

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:31.800
 can be joy and appreciation, this deep gratitude for the Dharma, for the causes for happiness,

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.800
 happiness to remove the causes of suffering, this deep joy and appreciation that we have

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.720
 this path that was taught to us. We have all these things in our favor to actually take

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:48.000
 steps on this path and get the freedom, the fruit of this path, become free forever for

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.040
 the benefit of all beings. Then bodhicitta, all beings are kind of in this same boat,

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.240
 all sentient beings. We don't want to hurt. We don't want to have pain. We don't want

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:05.760
 to suffer. Just like me, I don't want to suffer. All beings, we have this same situation. So

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.120
 what can I do to help? Even if it's just a little bit, what can I do to not hurt someone

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:17.280
 to help them? So really reactivate this bodhicitta, this big vast commitment, kind of activating

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.800
 the illusory kind of absolute nature of experience of appearance in our minds. And also with

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.400
 that like to really kind of connect to the detailed, the living embodiment and relationality

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:36.360
 of beings, like what can I do right now in this context, in this situation that I'm in?

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.320
 What can I do to better serve beings, to help them connect to their own nature, to help

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.320
 my own nature to more brightly shine out? So really bring this bodhicitta to mind as

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:53.920
 a living kind of living experience right now. And pure perception, begin by seeing the goodness

00:03:53.920 --> 00:04:00.080
 in oneself, seeing the goodness in others. Kind of this big open view that kind of doesn't

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:06.240
 hold so strongly onto forms and sounds and kind of movements of mind, emotions and thoughts.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.700
 Kind of a much more kind of open, like in a way playful, kind of light touch kind of

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.440
 experience of what's happening right now. To connect to this goodness, this kind of

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:21.720
 sizzling quality of this bodhicitta in my heart and other beings' hearts. To like kind

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:29.120
 of really see this nature first and have this nature kind of like fill our vision and illuminate

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.720
 to bring to light kind of this, have this glowing nature of bodhicitta really kind of

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.800
 be part of our living experience. That this is actually kind of the mandala or the world

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.160
 that we're in now. There's this beautiful Buddha nature shining in all directions, outside,

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:50.400
 inside, up, down, all the ten directions everywhere. So try to just to become receptive vessels

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.000
 of the dharma and just that means actually to become a living presence of dharma. We

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:23.720
 activate this together, renunciation, bodhicitta, pure perception for a moment.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:53.160
 Thank you. So kind of the topic for today which is just we have a little short time to reflect

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:58.360
 on the dharma together then we'll go into the complete dujum tersar nundra practice.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.560
 The kind of topping today is more of like an inquiry. This is like kind of really open

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:09.440
 question for myself and just for you too if you want. The question is where do I want

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:22.220
 to go deep? Where do I want to go deep? So that's kind of the question. So the opening

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:29.600
 of space you get to be in together. There's so many things we can explore in life. The

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:41.320
 time is just passing. Really yesterday's gone. Earlier today's gone. Things really more and

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:47.760
 more quickly seem like they're just becoming these memories and yet we have this whole

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:54.400
 vast world outside and inside that we can explore. There's so many amazing things that

00:06:54.400 --> 00:07:02.440
 we can put our time and energy into. There's also so much of this kind of distraction.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:14.400
 So that's a real question especially for Buddhist practitioner. Where do I want to go deep?

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:20.760
 And it's a real question in the sense of we have to answer this for ourselves and we have

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:25.800
 to keep asking ourselves this question and keep answering this question and we do that

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:31.000
 every single moment whether we're aware of it or not because we keep choosing what we're

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:41.040
 doing with our mind. We keep placing our mind somewhere. We keep filling our days with activities.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:48.520
 We're choosing where we want to go deep every day. Whatever habits we cultivate that's where

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:54.240
 we're going deep. This is the habit we're growing. So it's kind of in one way. It's

00:07:54.240 --> 00:08:00.960
 an unavoidable question. What do I want to focus on? What do I want to get really good

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:07.560
 at? What do I want to fill my time with? Where do I want to place my energy? What am I going

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:26.040
 to spend my wealth on? Where am I going to have my Buddha nature really be present with?

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:30.000
 Because every moment we're really answering that question for ourselves by what we do

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.800
 with our mind and what we do with our speech and what we do with our bodies. And I say

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:41.840
 that as a real question for myself. What am I cultivating? What am I opening into? What

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:57.040
 am I closing away from? What am I exploring? What am I growing? And so this is just a kind

00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:02.000
 of big opening question because now it's information age and it's always been, you know, there's

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:10.120
 always been so many things we can explore. And to get really good at something and to

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:15.480
 really go deep, to get some real nuance and flexibility with something, to really grow

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:24.160
 a skill, to really deepen a relationship, to deepen trust, to really kind of enrich

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:32.280
 connection. All these things take time. We keep having to choose them to really get good

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:39.700
 at Dharma, to really have our, you know, going for refuge, to really have that become stable,

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:45.640
 to really have bodhicitta beyond more of the time, to really see everything as an offering

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:53.160
 we're making to the three jewels, to really actively take on experience as a purification,

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:58.480
 to really keep connecting to the living lineage blessings of the enlightened beings here and

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:07.100
 everywhere, to keep dedicating the merit so that I can be more effective, so that my bodhicitta

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:16.080
 can be more bright, more stable. All these take time. This is just the nundra. And these

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:22.160
 are just qualities of being a really a bodhisattva on the path. These are all choices we have

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:30.480
 to keep making, and no one can make them for us. No one can make our mind do anything.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:36.080
 We have to keep putting our attention where we want to actually grow and go deep. This

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:45.200
 is really up to each of us. So as a bodhis, this is kind of a big opportunity because

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:49.680
 really for like really healthy bodhis, and according like following the teachings of

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:56.120
 the Buddha, this is 100% in our power and our control. What am I doing with my mind

00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:06.800
 right now? This is 100% up to me. How is my heart now? This is 100% up to me. So Buddhism

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:13.000
 has responsibility right at the just the beating center of the whole path of Buddhism. No matter

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:19.360
 what's happening outside, good things and bad things, gain and loss, praise and blame,

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:26.640
 all these things like I still comes down to my decision of what am I going to do in response?

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:36.480
 What am I doing with this moment now? Because we can't get good at everything. We can't

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:43.520
 learn everything. There's always going to be more to know. There's always going to be

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:52.160
 more to do. It really literally is endless. So that question of what am I where am I going

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:59.360
 to go deep? It's a very real question. It's definitely active for me because when I choose

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:04.880
 to go somewhere deep, that's actually pretty shallow. It doesn't make me feel really good.

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:16.560
 It doesn't really help much. Then that taste in my mouth is it gets, it's not very pleasant.

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:27.400
 But then I'm overcome with all these bad habits, laziness, distraction, complaining. Why me?

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:36.480
 I want vacation. All these, you know, basically trying to avoid actually dealing with the

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:42.000
 present moment. There's so many ways to avoid that and just say, put the blame somewhere

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:49.320
 else. If only something, something was changed, then I would really, wow, then my, I would

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:54.480
 really practice. Then my path would really open up. But this is really not way of Buddhism

00:12:54.480 --> 00:13:03.040
 it should be because it's some sorrow. It's never going to be perfect. There's always

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:08.760
 going to be something wrong. Pervasive, the pervasive quality of conditioned existence

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:15.080
 of conditioned grasping mind, duality mind is suffering dissatisfaction. This is always

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:22.280
 going to be a part of duality mind. This is never going to be all right. When we stay

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:35.120
 in the realm of duality mind, it's just not that's kind of effect. So in terms of this

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:38.640
 topic, kind of the interesting way this is open for me just today, this is like kind

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:43.680
 of thinking, Oh, I should, I really want to look at his only doodramache. He has big commentary

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:49.800
 on the didgerim chairs are none grow, torture lighting the way to freedom, complete instructions

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:56.080
 on the preliminary practices. So this is a gold is like really invaluable. This commentary

00:13:56.080 --> 00:14:01.280
 by his Holiness is so precious. And then I'd really thought with this question, because

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:07.840
 it was more actively in my mind, where do I want to go deep? Because time is going.

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:13.200
 And whether I really develop a capacity or not, it's really the opportunity is shrinking

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:17.960
 each day. I have to choose, I have to consciously make this choice, what I'm going to put my

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:25.880
 time and energy to, because the opportunity is escaping every day, impermanence, right?

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:32.120
 So I thought in this book, I should really look at this book. So I turned on the back.

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:36.920
 And there's a beautiful quote on the back. And I read it, and I was like, Oh, this is

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:41.360
 so beautiful. So at the very least, can read a quote of his Holiness doodramache, and this

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:47.280
 will be a big benefit. And no matter what else I say right now, and then we'll practice

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:52.720
 the nundra together, that's really a big benefit. So that makes this time together meaningful,

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:56.240
 even if nothing else is meaningful during this time. And then to have heard the words,

00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:01.160
 the Vadra speech of someone like his Holiness doodramache is exquisitely important. It's

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:11.320
 so special. So this is just from the back of this book. Okay, so it's all in the context

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:23.040
 of where do I want to go deep? So as Holiness doodramache says, unless we have faith, however

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:28.760
 many other good qualities we might have, they will not be of much use to us, as though we

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:35.560
 were very beautiful but blind. So we have to make an effort to develop faith by meditating

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:42.560
 on impermanence four times a day, by reflecting minutely on actions and their effects, by

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:43.040
 reflecting

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:50.480
 on the positive aspects of everything, by reflecting on how rare the Dharma is, by thinking

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:58.120
 of our teachers kindness, by thinking of our spiritual brothers and sisters with pure perception,

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:03.000
 and by thinking of the excellent qualities of the Buddha. It is important to consider

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:10.120
 that other people are, all of them, marvelous, and to be free of partiality and notions of

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:23.200
 high or low status, thus making a habit of faith and taming your own mind. So in terms

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:36.600
 of this question, where do I want to go deep? That's a Buddhist. This is really just such

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:42.960
 a treasure. It's really saying not only where I could go deep, but how I could go deep,

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:47.720
 how to get there. So then I thought, read this quote, and then I was looking a little

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:56.160
 more in this book. I was like, really? Where can I go into this question? And so then I

00:16:56.160 --> 00:17:01.640
 randomly flipped through the book this morning, and I randomly flipping, and I just opened

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:09.640
 the book, and I opened to this same quote. This is truly random in the sense of trying

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:18.560
 to do this, okay? Cause and condition random, huh? So page 154, I'm going to read the same

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:24.960
 quote because this is literally of this whole big book, 350 or so page book, then I opened

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:30.520
 and it's the same quote. So I want to read this quote again, because at least for me,

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:34.720
 then I need this quote. This is really kind of something that I need to put more time

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:45.320
 into to go deep with, okay? So here's the same exact quote, "Unless we have faith, however

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:52.440
 many other good qualities we might have, they will not be of much use to us, as though we

00:17:52.440 --> 00:18:00.160
 were very beautiful but blind. So we have to make an effort to develop faith by meditating

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:08.810
 on impermanence four times a day, by reflecting minutely on actions and their effects, by

00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:08.880
 reflecting

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:16.200
 on the positive aspects of everything, by reflecting on how rare the Dharma is, by thinking

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:21.480
 of our teacher's kindness, by thinking of our spiritual brothers and sisters with pure

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:28.940
 perception, and by thinking of the excellent qualities of the Buddha. It is important to

00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:36.280
 consider that other people are, all of them, marvelous, and to be free of partiality and

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:42.720
 notions of high or low status, thus making a habit of faith and taming your own mind."

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:52.000
 Then it goes on to say, "The omniscient Dharma Lord said," this is Longchampa, "Unless you

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:59.040
 do all you can to develop faith, you will never attain perfection, but will wonder constantly

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:05.360
 in cyclic existence. Therefore, whomever you are following, make every effort to cultivate

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:15.600
 faith." So for me, part of the answer to this question of where do I want to go deep, it

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:23.480
 really has to involve faith. So we can open this a little more together, but on this next

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:30.280
 page in the same book, page 155, there's a section, the next section, "The Causes and

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:36.840
 Conditions That Make Faith Grow or Decrease." And so here I'll read this, "C causes that

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:49.880
 make faith grow." How can we increase our faith and devotion? By sincerely following

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:57.560
 a sublime being, a qualified teacher. By relying on special companions who have blended their

00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:08.720
 minds with the teachings. By studying the profound sutras and tantras. By reflecting

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:17.920
 undistractedly on death. By reading or listening to stories that illustrate the law of cause

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:28.640
 and effect. And by doing longer sessions than before of meditation and practice on the profound

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:47.440
 teachings. So these are a few of the conditions that will make faith grow. And then I'll go

00:20:47.440 --> 00:21:02.920
 back to page 153, the same section on faith, on categories of faith. The essence of faith,

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:13.160
 this is again his Holiness, his words. "The essence of faith is a clear, untroubled mind,

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:20.680
 aware of what should be adopted and what should be avoided." So again, the essence of faith

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:29.240
 is a clear, untroubled mind, aware of what should be adopted and what should be avoided.

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:36.080
 And for this, there are three categories of faith. Vivid faith, eager faith, and confident

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:46.220
 faith. Vivid faith, this is the clear, fresh state brought about by the feeling of joy

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:52.640
 and devotion untainted by guile that results from seeing or hearing of the wondrous qualities

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:59.760
 of sublime beings. It is like the water purifying gem that renders turbid water limpid and

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:08.480
 it clears away all negative thoughts. Then eager faith, with this kind of faith, one

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:14.400
 yearns to be rid of the suffering of cyclic existence. One yearns to attain liberation

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:21.520
 and enlightenment. And to those two ends, one is eager to give up what is wrong and

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:28.580
 adopt what is right. Eager faith induces us to devote ourselves to the sublime Dharma

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:38.640
 in much the same way that desire for wealth is what makes people pursue riches.

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:47.720
 Then thirdly, confident faith. Confident faith implies confidence that cyclic existence and

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:56.920
 its causes are to be eliminated. Confidence that nirvana and its causes are to be adopted.

00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:03.840
 And confidence that indeterminate states are pointless. Just as confidence in the future

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:09.800
 harvest induces a farmer to till the soil, confidence that the sublime Dharma will never

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:18.000
 fail us gives us the necessary conviction to practice without doubting and hesitating.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:28.200
 I'll read the final line again. Confidence that the sublime Dharma will never fail us

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:44.400
 gives us the necessary conviction to practice without doubting and hesitating.

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:49.400
 So where do I want to go deep? For me, I mean, really, if I could get to the point where

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:59.400
 I had confidence that the sublime Dharma would never fail me, which would lead to the necessary

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:09.040
 conviction to practice without doubting and hesitating, then I want to go deep there.

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:17.520
 That the Dharma is unfailing. That kind of vivid, eager, confident faith, the Dharma's

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:25.940
 unfailing can clearly, in my mind, clearly know what to adopt, clearly know what to avoid,

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:34.280
 and to eagerly choose what to adopt. Happiness and the causes of happiness are here, nirvana

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:41.720
 and the causes of attaining nirvana, and eliminating suffering and the causes of suffering. So

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:48.520
 eliminating being trapped in endless samsara by actually removing, doing the work, really

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:58.640
 the work of not planting more seeds of suffering, and truly choosing that.

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:04.520
 And so for Buddhists, this is really comes down to, it is a question of faith, but defined

00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:20.640
 in this way. This is very clearly not a blind faith. It's a very clear definition of faith.

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:30.800
 And for Buddhists, this is kind of what we need to have. Where do I want to go deep?

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:40.000
 We really do need this faith. And then how do we get this faith? I mean, this is so clear.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:47.520
 To really look at suffering, to really investigate what is the cause of this suffering? Is it

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:57.440
 possible to stop this suffering? If it's possible to actually pursue the path, the treatment?

00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:18.000
 To actually grow, to deepen what stops suffering? This is very scientific.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 So I don't know, this is an open inquiry. There's not some big final point I'm trying to get

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:34.880
 to here. Time is really running out. We have such a good support right now. This body, the

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:42.320
 living dharma, is living teachers. We can do anything we want to do with our mind. We can

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:47.840
 choose to grow and deepen whatever we want to grow and deepen. And we know how to. Even

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:53.840
 just what I was reading here today, that's enough to know. That's a full path. Just in

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:58.480
 these few little quotes, kind of randomly pulled out of this big book, this treasure

00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:05.840
 trove of teachings, this is all that we need. So how much time do I want to waste dabbling

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:12.480
 in this and that? That's a really personal question. Because if I'm drowning in samsara,

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:21.680
 I can wish upon a star to save all beings, but I can't really help much.

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:27.440
 And I should aspire to save all beings. I should aspire until every single being is

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:32.880
 free from suffering that I will remain to do whatever it takes to protect them, to care

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:38.960
 for them, to love them, to nourish them, to defend them. In whatever way is actually helpful.

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:44.480
 Like to have that level of bodhisattva vision. It has to actually be helpful, which means I

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:50.320
 really have to tune into what is helpful. And that's very context dependent. I really have

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:55.440
 to show up and tune into the situation. Not the way I want it to be, but the way it is,

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:58.800
 what's going on with someone else, what's actually available in the situation.

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:04.000
 I really have to develop these abilities to be able to do that. It takes a lot of,

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:09.120
 there's a lot of deepening in that process, but really to get, to have that beast, you know,

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:17.280
 kind of like deep enough to really have that dream come true for all beings to be free of suffering

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:17.280
.

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:24.560
 I definitely have to get more free myself. There's no question. And we know this path.

00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:31.440
 We know how. And that's really why at Nundra, the foundational practices, this is in one way. It's

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:37.040
 like a lot of different ways to list the four common Nundros, you know, how to turn the mind

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:43.040
 towards the Dharma, how to turn the mind away from samsara, presciences of human embodiment,

00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:49.840
 impermanence, causes and conditions and effects, the suffering of conditioned mind or cyclic

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:55.440
 existence. We really have to, this has to be like permeating our, our being, our mind state

00:28:56.400 --> 00:29:02.320
 all the time. That's the path. And this is the foundation of every Nundra session of every kind

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:07.600
 of as a Dharma person from the ground up from Theravada into Sutra mayana into tantra mayana

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:12.880
 into Zogchen and these higher level teachings. They all have this bedrock. The four thoughts

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:20.560
 that turn the mind towards the Dharma. And if we really turn our mind towards the Dharma,

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:25.520
 this is kind of the definition of faith. Once we really turns our mind towards the Dharma,

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:33.840
 these four points, that is faith. Because we're just clearly seeing how reality functions,

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:38.720
 how cause and effect functions, what leads to happiness, what leads to suffering,

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:46.720
 the precious opportunity we have to actually take steps on this path to freedom.

00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:07.760
 So that's kind of it. There's a million ways that the world is on fire.

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:15.680
 The generate age, and it's just some suffering, suffering, cyclic existence, it's always going

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:21.920
 to be breaking. It's just how it is. And I say that with like a tenderness of heart. This is,

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:31.760
 I'm so sad. This is always how it's going to be. But if I just constantly am thinking about what's

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:38.480
 wrong, what's broken, this is broken, that's bad, this big thing, how to do this. And I don't

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:45.840
 actually put in the time and energy to deepen my own experience of bodhicitta, my own experience

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:54.480
 of freedom by actually planting the seeds for the causes of happiness and removing the distortions,

00:30:54.480 --> 00:31:00.320
 the distractions that cause suffering, then I'm just kind of fooling myself. I'm really wasting

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:00.640
 time.

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:10.880
 It's just like an entertainment, doom scrolling, you know. Oh, this, it's like seeing more ways

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:16.560
 that samsara is suffering. Oh, this is, it's still suffering today. The samsara is still suffering,

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:22.240
 but not actually doing anything about it. Just kind of like, it's like, oh, suffering still,

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:28.160
 more suffering. See this, honey, there's more suffering today. Who wants to hear the list of

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:33.680
 suffering? Not if you're, if you're really not going to do anything about the second noble truth,

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:38.800
 third noble truth, fourth noble truth. What are the causes of suffering? Can they be removed and

00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:43.440
 removing them? Just listing suffering is what does it really do to help anything?

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:52.640
 So in our own abilities to like actually really clearly see with discernment and with curiosity

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:58.720
 and with compassion and love and tenderness and really open-mindedness, how this suffering is

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:03.600
 working. And then personally, like with my own mind, what I'm choosing to engage in with my

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:04.240
 awareness

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:09.920
 right now to connect to this bodhicitta. So like we said in the beginning, renunciation,

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:15.360
 bodhicitta, pure perception. These are three ways that no matter what we're experiencing,

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:23.600
 no matter what's happening around us, these will hold us on the path. They'll brighten our faith.

00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:31.840
 They'll help us keep going deeper into something that's endlessly deep, the dharma. They'll help

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:37.600
 us grow the conviction that the dharma really is unfailing because it's just talking about how

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:43.680
 cause and effect works. And then we have a bigger span of what we talk about when we mean cause and

00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:51.280
 effect. Bigger and bigger, wider and wider. So this is just about becoming more and more inclusive,

00:32:51.280 --> 00:33:00.960
 having more of the nature be on our radar, being more tuned into more interdependence.

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:08.080
 That's what the path of dharma leads to. And that's where freedom is, to be completely

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:13.920
 perfectly in tune with interdependence. That's called freedom or enlightenment.

00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:22.880
 So I pray for myself, really, where do I want to go deep? I really want that. I want to go deep to

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:29.440
 have this unfailing conviction that dharma will never fail. And then to take that resolve and to

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:34.610
 put this time, this moment, this moment of mine again and again and again, to line it up with dh

00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:34.880
arma,

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:39.600
 to turn my mind towards the dharma, to open my heart towards dharma, to put time on the cushion,

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:44.320
 to have that goodness be present in my mind, my interactions, my relationships,

00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:51.360
 to really keep with really enthusiastic joy, keep turning my mind towards the dharma until it

00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:51.600
 really

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:57.040
 saturates my being all the time. That's really a prayer I have for myself, for all beings. We

00:33:57.040 --> 00:34:02.880
 can really be free in that way. By tuning into interdependence, by tuning into our own goodness

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:07.760
 nature, by seeing that in others, and by really actively doing that again and again, that's called

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:16.880
 the path. So that's kind of a little bit of an inquiry into where to go deep. And that's just,

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:23.120
 there's all these different ways to answer that. And we each have full responsibility and power to

00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:28.960
 answer that for ourselves. And we keep answering it every single moment with what we do with our

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:36.400
 mind and our speech and our body. So that's kind of a brief little reflection. And then we'll go

00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:38.800
 into this, "Dhudjima, here's our nundra practice."
