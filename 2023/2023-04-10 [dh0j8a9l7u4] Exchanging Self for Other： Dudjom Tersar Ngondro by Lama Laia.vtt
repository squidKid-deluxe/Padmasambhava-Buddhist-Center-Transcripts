00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.240
 So, again, thank you and welcome. Thank you for taking the time to come together and practice

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:21.120
 and reflect a little bit. I don't know, I hope, if anyone was expecting Lama Drakpa here today,

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:28.840
 I'm sorry. I was supposed to go to New York City and Lama Drakpa stay here, but kind of

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:35.640
 at the last minute we realized we had to swap. So I'm here today. Lama Drakpa is in New York

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:46.360
 City at our monthly meditation there. And right now, I don't know how many of you were

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:59.120
 here last week, but we did a little bit more extended kind of review of the 18 freedoms

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:17.840
 and endowments and kind of went over those and then also these kind of 16 kind of circumstances

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.080
 and kind of propensities we might have that if we don't watch out for them, they can really

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:32.160
 kind of make our freedoms and endowments diminish. So we went over that a little bit last week

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:47.840
 and a couple people wrote with some questions. I thought before we begin again, you know,

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:54.880
 all of us before we start anything, again, connecting with our real purity motivations,

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:03.840
 our true joy, appreciation, bodhicitta, pure perception, devotion, you know, really especially

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:14.200
 re-strengthening our bodhicitta and our openness awareness, our wisdom awareness, really just

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:25.140
 tapping into how open our situation is and really connect with, you know, with that joy

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:35.480
 and appreciation for our beautiful situation. Just really let that sink deep and just vastly

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:42.480
 splash, you know, really extend our bodhicitta to every living being, including ourselves,

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:49.800
 you know, as sentient beings by definition, right? Sentient beings pervasive as space.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:59.360
 We're all experiencing some kind of challenge due to just our basic ignorance of our situation.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.380
 In big ways and little ways, we're all struggling with our emotions and our, you know, our

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:06.280
 ignorance,

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:12.800
 our hopes and our fears. And so just really, we're going to just again, taking the time,

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:20.040
 we'll all just each reconnect with that motivation that we can truly with our practice, with

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:26.360
 our study, our contemplation, our practice, both on the cushion, off the cushion, we can

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:34.120
 really truly be a benefit to other beings. Again, as vast as space in temporary ways,

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:40.240
 as well as eventually that we have the ability to help lead them to enlightenment, to realize

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:47.710
 their own beautiful nature. And then in particular, you know, really connecting with this bodhic

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:48.000
itta

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.520
 that we're connecting with now and reflecting on these, the Vajrayana, the teachings of

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:59.400
 the Buddha, and in particular, connecting with the Vajrayana teachings and these beautiful

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:05.820
 essential foundational teachings of the nundra practices, which embody all the Buddha's teachings

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:11.840
 and practices. And then in particular, are the ground and the essence for our Vajrayana

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:19.920
 and Zoktian practice, which means also our Vajrayana and Zoktian realization, which is

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:25.720
 again falls right back to bodhicitta, the heart, the heart of enlightenment, the heart

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:51.960
 of the Dharma, the real heart of our practice.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:05:07.540
 So I thought this precious human birth, always calling to mind within the outer nundra practices,

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:14.600
 the precious human birth is the first one we come upon. And it's just so vital. Again,

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:21.600
 these four thoughts that turn the mind were encouraged to do not just with our nundra,

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:28.220
 but before any practice we do, whether we verbalize it, or just internally reflect on

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:35.600
 them. And so again, both within our, our formal session, as well as just throughout the day,

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:43.240
 taking time to study, to read, to truly contemplate, both maybe with a book or listening, but also

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:50.080
 just as we're in the world reflecting on what we remember, really bringing this to heart

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:56.960
 and home, you know, not just our precious human birth, but what else, right, impermanence,

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:03.640
 the law of karma, the defects of samsara, just really bringing them in. And we can see

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:10.100
 how in each one, kind of their elements of those other four. And why? Because we tend

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:17.640
 to forget. And like Kenpoche says, reflecting on these four thoughts, it just helps kind

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:24.360
 of bring some more warmth and moisture softens our hard heads and brings some warmth and

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:31.000
 moisture and openness and warm hardness and appreciation for our situation just by looking

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:39.960
 at it. So this precious, you know, the freedoms and endowments of this human birth are extremely

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:46.920
 difficult to obtain. That's what we talked about last week. And again, we just went over

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:55.000
 kind of a little more detail what these freedoms and favorable conditions are. And we know,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:02.560
 right, there's eight freedom states, eight freedom states where we were free of situations

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:11.880
 where we wouldn't be able to study or practice Dharma. And we have, we're totally endowed

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:20.300
 with these totally favorable conditions for actually practicing and realizing the Dharma

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:26.040
 for the benefit of ourselves and others. So again, just kind of quickly reviewing what

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:32.600
 those things are. The eight freedom states that we find ourselves, right, we're free

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:38.880
 of being born in the hell realms. We're free of being born in the hungry ghost realms.

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:46.960
 We're free of being born in the animal realms. We're free of being born in the God realms.

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:53.680
 We're free of being, we're born human. And yet we are born human. We're free of being

00:07:53.680 --> 00:08:04.000
 born human in a world where a Buddha never appeared. We're also free of being born human

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:11.560
 in a world where the Buddha appeared, but we're free of being born in a part of the world

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:22.080
 where the Buddha's teachings don't exist. And we're also free of being born in a human

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:30.320
 world where the Buddha's teachings have come and where they're around us, where we were

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:36.320
 born and where we live. And we're free of having all those conditions, but we're also

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:41.820
 free of having wrong views, which in this case we could think of like just really not

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:50.400
 having any true trust in the law of cause and effect or any real interest or devotion in

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:55.880
 the three jewels or the Buddhist teachings. We're free of that. Obviously we all have

00:08:55.880 --> 00:09:04.620
 some degree of interest in the Buddhist teachings, which means we're aware of them to some degree.

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:10.560
 And then also kind of similar, we're free of being born human in a world born to the

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:17.120
 Dharma in a place where the Buddhist teachings are around us. But then also we're free of

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:23.440
 a situation where to do the circumstances of our body or our mind, we're unable to actually

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:28.840
 connect with them. So we're free of all those. And then we have all these beautiful outer

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:37.040
 circumstances where we are born, which are then these 10 freedoms, five that are referring

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:42.800
 to the outer circumstances we're born and five that are connected to the inner kind

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:51.480
 of proclivities and kind of circumstances of our mind. And again, to review those quickly,

00:09:51.480 --> 00:10:00.420
 we're born where a Buddha has appeared. We're born where the Buddha taught. We're born where

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:10.600
 those teachings still exist. We're born where those teachings are still practiced. They're

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:18.760
 still followed. They're still able to be understood. And we're born where those who do follow them

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:27.200
 and do understand them have the great kindness to share them. And then these five inner qualities

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:51.680
 we have, we have interest in the in the teachings, we're able, we're able to connect with them.

00:10:51.680 --> 00:11:02.360
 We have trust and faith in the Dharma. We're so it's, it's a beautiful situation, but we

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:07.240
 want to guide that. We want to guard that. Because like Kim Porem Pashay says, and what

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:12.640
 we kind of spent more time talking with last week was, you know, while we might have all

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:20.040
 these freedoms and endowments, sometimes these last two kind of waiver. So that's why it's

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:28.040
 so important we really pay attention to our mindfulness, our alertness, our conscientiousness,

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:34.000
 really don't let our negative emotions get the best of us and try to purify when they

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:41.280
 do. And be careful about, you know, why we're tender young ones. You know, the influence

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:49.640
 we have, the influences that we subject ourselves to, you know, as far as, you know, other people

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:55.880
 we look to and trust in for advice and guidance and reaffirmation, you know, just being careful

00:11:55.880 --> 00:12:03.320
 of that. And really watching our authenticity and being careful with our actions. I don't

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:07.960
 know. That's what it kind of boils down to. So I want to kind of get to the questions.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:17.680
 I just thought to quickly review those. So Kristin asked one question. So it's especially

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:28.680
 regarded in regard to like this fourth freedom, which is, so she said, we're fortunate not

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:37.400
 to be born in a time or place where the culture is barbaric, where violence and ego are glorified.

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:45.280
 Yet it seems there is such an acceleration of these qualities. Can you address this?

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:56.920
 How do we make sense and understand and work with this? So I guess one thing, I think I

00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:01.320
 understand the question and there's different ways to answer this. And of course I'm no

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:11.600
 big expert. I'm just another Dharma sibling. So I'm sure by all of us hearing people's

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:17.800
 questions, we have our own kind of can turn our mind to the richness of our understanding

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:23.160
 of what some of the answers of that are. But here again, we're particularly talking about

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:31.960
 this in the context of being practitioners. And we're also particularly really connecting

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:38.160
 with how each one of us as practitioners are addressing this for ourselves, how we're working

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:44.520
 with our own mind and our own circumstances. And of course, as we can help others, but

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:51.720
 we're really talking about ourselves here. So, you know, sometimes this word barbarian

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:59.880
 came up and I was talking about that. Forgive me, I'm a little, I just want to kind of parse

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:07.360
 that out a little bit because right when we say these prayers, how, you know, the soul

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:13.920
 refuge and the soul source of refuge is the Buddhist teachings. Of course, in the big,

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:23.560
 big, big picture, we all have this beautiful connection with Dharma and the Buddhist teachings.

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:31.320
 But what are the essence of the Buddhist teachings? I think we could say loving kindness,

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:33.080
 compassion,

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:39.480
 and wisdom, and understanding. So I think it's safe to say wherever those qualities

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:44.440
 exist in some degree, that's getting close to the Dharma, right? Because the Dharma isn't

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:53.760
 this foreign element. The Dharma is the essence of every living being. And so even if, you

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:59.200
 know, there are vehicles, even in the Buddhist teaching, the Buddha points out, yes, there's

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:05.560
 the teachings, the vehicles of the nine yanas, but there's also worldly vehicles. And when

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:13.120
 it's in those vehicles, especially that can recognize cause and effect, but not necessarily

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:20.280
 looking for liberation or freedom from samsara, but doing good things in order to have good

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:27.780
 circumstances in this and future lives. And that means there's some degree of especially

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:36.520
 loving kindness and good thoughts towards others and compassion and some degree of wisdom,

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:43.160
 at least the wisdom to kind of believe in cause and effect. And that's okay, we can

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:51.320
 be reborn in good circumstances, you know. But what's so special is then wherever a Buddha

00:15:51.320 --> 00:16:00.040
 appears is giving the teachings for exploring deeply the nature, both how it functions and

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:12.560
 appears, but also the essence and the nature of that. So I think that's important to remember.

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:18.400
 And then in particular here, again, when it's talking about sometimes these mentioning barbarians,

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:27.000
 it's meaning a place like I mentioned here, a place where born in a world, we can be born

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.760
 even in this world, maybe now the Buddhist teachings are very quite pervasive. But you

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:38.800
 know, there were times when the Buddhist teachings weren't available, where they were maybe

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:39.320
 thriving

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:44.840
 in little pockets of the world, but not available to a bunch of people. So that's kind of also

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:48.480
 what it's indicating is when wherever we're born, we could be born in a world where the

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:53.680
 Buddhist teachings exist, but just due to where we're born, not have ever have any contact

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:59.520
 with them. So that's one thing. But then of course, as sentient beings, we're working

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:07.640
 with our negative emotions. And I think that's also what Kristin was more kind of asking

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:16.200
 about here. You know, how it sounds like she's just reflecting on how maybe it might appear

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:23.560
 that there's an acceleration of self, you know, kind of culture of self involvement,

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:31.040
 and violence, kind of being glorified as well as who knows all kinds of other things we

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:39.830
 can get wrapped up in. And I know in the Buddhist teachings on the gross level, this is a degener

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:40.240
ate

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:48.640
 age. This is a time where we have more challenges come up more inner turmoil and imbalance more

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:58.860
 outer turmoil and imbalance in all kinds of ways. And the important thing to remember

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:08.720
 here is again, like the teachers always point out to us, these circumstances aren't random.

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:23.320
 They're all the effects of our own individual and collective past actions. So we're Dharma

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:29.240
 again, we're Dharma practitioners. So we maybe what we're talking about here, we may not

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:36.710
 necessarily share with someone who's not interested or you know, but here we're Dharma

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:38.080
 practitioners,

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:41.840
 you know, we're thinking about these things. That means we're taking responsibility for

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:53.440
 our own experience. So in the teachings, these big cycles happen of golden ages, degenerate

00:18:53.440 --> 00:19:00.960
 ages, you know, rising and falling, you know, really pristine, easy times even in human

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:09.160
 worlds, but then also really rough times. And that's all again, that's all just the reflection

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:21.440
 of the inner views and actions and motivations of ourselves. And of course, like we always

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:28.520
 hear what makes all the difference is how we move forward, what view we take, what intention,

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:35.740
 what motivation we have as we move forward. And that's again, what in these teachings

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:44.400
 even on the 18 freedoms and endowments, so rare to find, you know, like we can read about,

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:51.360
 you know, the examples of how rare this human birth is to find and comparisons and things

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:58.080
 like that such as, you know, very famous, the sea turtle, the blind sea turtle that comes

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:07.520
 up only surfaces once every hundred years or every, even sometimes every aeon, you know,

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:13.040
 not only surfaces on the ocean, but happens to surface where there happens to be like

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:19.520
 a wooden yoke, a wooden ring bobbing on the surface. And this blind sea turtle happens

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:29.400
 to surface once every hundred years to, to take a breath. That's the famous classical

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:36.080
 example of the Buddha gave for how rare this precious human birth is. Or another one that

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:42.160
 like Patra Rinpoche mentions is the chances of being born human are as rare as if we had

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:50.640
 a bunch of dried peas and toss them at the wall, the chances of one sticking, you know,

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:56.520
 or like the numerical comparisons. You know, if, like, if we look at all the stars, if

00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:08.160
 it's a totally moonlit, you know, moon free night, sky full of clear, full of stars, the

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:13.360
 mount in the teachings, right? The sutras, the Buddha says the vastness of all those

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:20.000
 stars at night, if we were to say those were all the hell realm beings, then the comparison

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:27.240
 of all the other beings in the six realms would be like how many stars we see in the

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:37.320
 day, right? One, maybe two in the morning. And then likewise, we could say and then for

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:44.360
 the hungry ghosts, if they were the amount of stars in the sky, you know, the, the animals

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:51.480
 and the other higher realms would be as vast as would be as in comparison, just like the

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:58.520
 day star, and so on we could go. Or like also another comparison was like with grain with

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:06.560
 like particles of dust and snow. Like if we were to look at it just to give comparisons,

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:20.640
 I think the Buddha said things we can kind of begin to imagine at least the hell realms,

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:28.160
 the amount of beings born in hell realms is as vast as however, how many particles of

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:37.240
 dust there are in the whole world. And then in comparison to that, all the hungry ghosts

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:45.080
 are about as many grains of sand there are in like the huge the Ganges River, or like

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:56.120
 any huge big river in the world, the Mississippi River.

00:22:56.120 --> 00:23:11.440
 The number of animals. I want to make sure I have my the number of animals are how many,

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:19.680
 like if we they use the metaphor of like a barrel of of barley, or like we could say

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:30.680
 a silo of barley or a big giant barrel of rice or grains, how many animals there are.

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:40.160
 And then the asuras, the demigods, there is as many of those in relation to these proportions

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:47.240
 as snowflakes and a blizzard. And then how many gods, how many humans and kind of other

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:56.360
 gods is as much dust on your fingernail. This precious human birth is very rare in the teachings

00:23:56.360 --> 00:24:02.120
 and there's all kinds of other ways we could look at how rare it is. And like we know,

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:13.920
 it is very rare. But then what's our second our second thought that turns the mind impermanence.

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:21.400
 It's not here forever. And what's going to make all the difference for the future is

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:29.120
 again, our beautiful circumstances are also due to our past actions and beautiful connections

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:34.400
 and the merit and wisdom we have accumulated. How beautiful and we want to nurture that

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:42.320
 and protect it and grow it even more. And so that's why, you know, as practitioners,

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:54.360
 we're meeting the situation we find ourselves to develop our bodhicitta. And what is that?

00:24:54.360 --> 00:25:09.920
 I mean, of course, the six paramitas. And I want to read the second question someone

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:13.840
 wrote just because it is beginning to fit in here too. And I'm not going to be able

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:20.000
 to answer all this because we have to do our practice. But this was from one of Reap's,

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:27.080
 one of our Dharma brothers in Nashville, who as we know, there was this tragedy last week

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:34.800
 or the week before of the shooting. So he was asking that in that context of, you know,

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:43.840
 these shootings happening. It was good to be reminded of our Buddha nature and the proximity

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:49.560
 of enlightened beings of the tradition. It was good to recite mantras of compassionate

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:56.960
 beings and to remember their and our commitment to all beings. But then what he's asking about

00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:04.360
 is I'm still wanting to know how to hear more about how practitioners in the raw moment,

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:12.240
 how should we approach tragedy? And how should we speak to others affected by tragedy? I

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:17.080
 think in a way that kind of goes back, kind of is connected with Christian's question

00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:22.880
 about, you know, oh, maybe it might seem like there's this big acceleration of self-importance

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:36.080
 and violence and distraction in the world. I guess that's all relative. I mean, I'll

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:41.640
 make one little side comment about that is I think we have to really kind of look, investigate,

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:48.160
 you know, that kind of thing when we were looking for the good old days or something.

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:52.400
 This isn't a perfect time. Of course, there is a lot of these things happening and things

00:26:52.400 --> 00:27:00.880
 to be careful of just as ordinary beings, not to mention Dharma practitioners. But I

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:08.320
 mean, for example, it's kind of rare right now that our big entertainment is to go watch

00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:16.860
 someone pulled apart at the county square, you know, or I mean, there's all kinds of

00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:23.160
 other examples we could have. And maybe they've been a little bit transformed and commercialized

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:29.320
 now. I don't know. But anyway, I think that's just one kind of little side note. I thought

00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:36.720
 reading it is yes, it can seem that way, but it's good to to reflect on. Samsara is samsara.

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:43.480
 And there is tragedy, whether it's the tragedy that ourselves or others get caught up in

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:51.620
 these big distractions and actions that just lead to, you know, heavy karma. And also those

00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:58.080
 of us, you know, who are grieving, who have had loss and are faced with confusion and

00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:04.600
 just overwhelming kind of not knowing what to do or loss, whether it's the climate or

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:11.920
 shootings or losing a friend, or there's so many things, right. But we're practitioners

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:18.700
 again, it's what it comes back to. And I know you all know that. But something I find helpful

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:32.120
 to remember is that bodhicitta is the heart of our practice. And what is bodhicitta? But

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:42.520
 often bodhicitta is loving kindness, bodhicitta is compassion. But it's again, as we're addressing

00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:48.240
 ourselves and our own challenges, as well as trying to nourish others and help support

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:56.160
 others going through their challenges. Bodhicitta isn't just the love and compassion, the loving

00:28:56.160 --> 00:29:11.620
 kindness we're evoking. Bodhicitta is love, compassion, and wisdom. And so, especially

00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:19.600
 for ourselves, our bodhicitta practice is equally as much as it is connecting with kind

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:33.440
 of accumulating merit through patience, through generosity, through kind of proper conduct,

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:40.960
 through joyful effort and merit. We're accumulating those yes, but right, but we're also

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:41.620
 accumulating

00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:53.400
 wisdom, which means that in the biggest, most direct sense are emptiness awareness. Even

00:29:53.400 --> 00:30:01.480
 in the foundational vehicles, there's emptiness awareness of at least one thing, right, of

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:11.640
 the self. And then in different degrees of awareness of emptiness of other. And as Vajrayana

00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:21.800
 practitioners, at least the view we're starting on is in great emptiness. But great emptiness,

00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:26.760
 as we know, and what I think these questions are also getting at, and like with especially

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:34.240
 Reese's question and I think Kristin's too, is yes, you know, this is all an illusion,

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:42.640
 this is all empty and open. But by no means, again, it's not just wisdom. There's love.

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:54.320
 There's compassion. That means we want to still feel. We don't want to shirk away from

00:30:54.320 --> 00:31:03.280
 our challenges, or our hopes, or our fears, or our sensitive spots, our blind spots, you

00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:15.920
 know, our growth edges. But as much as we can kind of keep that open mind, open heart,

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:24.880
 emptiness awareness, that nothing is singular, nothing is independent, nothing is permanent,

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:30.480
 and know that negative emotions aren't going to, engaging and following through with them

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:39.520
 habitually, or intentionally, isn't going to help ourselves or others. And realize we

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:48.400
 need to tame our own minds, refrain from harm, engage with good, tame our own minds and feel.

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:58.000
 So right, that's a big part in our bodhicitta training of like Tonglen is about feeling

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:05.760
 equally with our emptiness awareness, with the open mind, open heart, kind of that big

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:14.240
 view, also having a big heart and really embracing as much as we can challenges, you know, so

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:20.960
 like for example, even with ourselves, when we bump up to our emotions, when we bump up

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:27.000
 to our sorrow, when we bump up to our grief, when we bump up to our shame, when we bump

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:33.720
 up with our anger, when we bump up with our jealousy, when we bump up with our arrogance,

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:39.600
 you know, when we bump up with our doubt and hesitation, when we meet those things, we

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:47.760
 want to, you know, a wisdom isn't just like numbing out to them or looking the other way.

00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:52.480
 With wisdom, we're rooted in the great openness of things. And again, we're developing our

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:58.760
 wisdom too, right? I know, but that's why they call it practice. But my point here is,

00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:09.120
 as much as we can be open, just even with ourselves to those things and really feel them and try

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:14.720
 to release them. And then like with Tonglen, where we're feeling those feelings, and just

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:19.880
 think how many other beings are going through the same things, and take that in and try

00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:26.240
 to connect with peace and the antidote, the, you know, the satisfaction and fulfillment

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:33.520
 and give that to every living being, right? This is all on the intention way, aspiration

00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:41.480
 way. But that's so fundamental. That's a big part of our bodhicitta training. And then

00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:46.240
 thinking of all the situations, trying to understand what others are going through to

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:52.840
 at least begin to understand. But if we can touch base with our own challenges and our

00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:59.800
 own grief, and think of all the others going through that too, and the mistakes we've made,

00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:05.720
 I mean, all of that, and purify, but also just kind of think we're not alone, think

00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:10.720
 of all the others, you know, going through that. So that's kind of very simple, I hope

00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:17.680
 it's not too patent answer. But I think it's an important one, just as good human beings,

00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:26.520
 not to mention Dharma practitioners, again, connecting, feeling, having an open mind and

00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:34.920
 an open heart, being able to witness our own jagged broken places, and those of others,

00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:41.640
 and then have some understanding, you know, that love and compassion. But then, more importantly,

00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:51.360
 as far as liberation from samsara goes, this great roar of the lion is the great emptiness,

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:57.840
 the great openness of the situation. And that's why we're practicing. And I'm sorry, I think

00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:13.280
 I'm running out of time, as far as I hope that's helpful. There's more to say. I'm sure if

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:20.840
 you were all here, we could have a big discussion. But within the time we have, I think that's

00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:32.360
 where I'll leave this now. Wisdom, love, compassion, blended together in our practice, as

00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:34.440
 practitioners,

00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:42.600
 really feeling, being aware, having the courage to lean into those kind of unwelcome situations

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:53.040
 and scary situations and, you know, to the degree, you know, that is within our capacities.

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:57.600
 And then in the world, I think, you know, there's all kinds of different people we can

00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:06.000
 meet who have their own availability and capacities. But the very basic thing we can do is, again,

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:11.320
 keep our own practice, keep our prayers for this world and all worlds, keep our bodhicitta

00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:20.480
 strong. And then as we're interacting with people, we don't need to, I think, just being

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:30.360
 present and open and kind is the thing, the most cross the board thing we can do, you

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:36.680
 know, for helping people through hard times, especially here, kind of relieving, talking

00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:43.000
 about this question about how to be with these raw grief, for example, with ourselves, but

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:49.480
 then also to help support others was part of that question. So, again, we all each individually

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:55.920
 have different capacities and familiarity with dealing with that grief, for example.

00:36:55.920 --> 00:37:03.440
 And also other people have different, you know, availability and ability to receive

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:11.880
 what we can offer. But we all thrive in an environment of openness, of like gentleness,

00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:17.960
 of just being present and centered. If we can each, it's amazing how medicinal, just

00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:24.120
 like, right, being present and centered can be. If we're ever with these great beings

00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:30.120
 who are or even another good friend who's centered and present, just that's healing.

00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:37.280
 And just being, having them available to us, you know, to share with. And then, of course,

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:43.280
 as Dharma practitioners, reminding each other of our practice. So I guess that's all I can

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:52.160
 really say, simply in a minute, about helping others in the immediacy of things. But, yeah,

00:37:52.160 --> 00:38:02.680
 so thank you. We'll do our practice now.

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:09.760
 Kindness and, again, connecting with motivation. If we have the presence of mind to reconnect

00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:17.000
 with our true wishes for the situation, we may not be able to change them, but sometimes

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:25.440
 in that confusion of strong emotions coming back to seeing what's the alarm bell going

00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:32.560
 off there. What is my true intention, especially my true motivation that's joyfully aligned

00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:43.840
 with Dharma, with love, compassion and wisdom, right?

00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:53.700
 Thank you. Thank you very much for coming. And then, if you don't mind, I just wanted

00:38:53.700 --> 00:39:01.840
 to add kind of review and a couple of small points around, that I meant to mention as

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:07.340
 answers to the questions that came up, which maybe I'm going to focus more on the aspect

00:39:07.340 --> 00:39:14.320
 of what do we do with rough emotions? What do we do with the rough circumstances outside

00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:24.080
 and rough turbulence inside and around us? Whatever one of them there are, whichever

00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:34.560
 one of the five poisons or the five emotions are roiling and boiling and sloshing. We're

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:45.100
 Dharma practitioners. So, in the sense of as Dharma practitioners, we have to remember

00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:53.640
 that yes, the world may be having what might seem like accelerated challenges and imbalance

00:39:53.640 --> 00:40:02.240
 and turmoil in the environment, in the minds and actions of beings in this world. We're

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:11.760
 Dharma practitioners. And the good news is we do have these five, these are 18 freedoms

00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:18.640
 and endowments. We do. And again, and again, and again, we really should not forget this

00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:26.440
 is not random. It's not co-accidental, as Rupasi says, this is due to all kinds of precious

00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:36.680
 causes and conditions that have come together. And this is our life. This is everything right

00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:44.040
 now. And we have that beautiful connection with the Dharma. And we have a beautiful connection

00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:51.320
 with not only the foundational teachings of the Buddha, but Mahayana and Vajrayana. And

00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:58.880
 that means too, this is the perfect playground for continuing to develop our merit and our

00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:07.340
 wisdom. This is the perfect playground to engage, really sincerely take to heart the

00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:17.880
 four boundless and really activate the six paramitas, really engender our love, our wisdom,

00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:24.040
 turn our own ego clinging upside down. And then of course, through the skillful means

00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:32.520
 of the Vajrayana, purify our rough emotions and our perceptions. So this is the perfect

00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:38.160
 playground for that. That's maybe part of the beautiful causes and conditions. That

00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:45.480
 is the fulfillment of our long standing bodhicitta aspirations and actions of past lives and

00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:51.740
 our connection with the Vajrayana teachings. So that's beautiful. And that's why we want

00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:58.680
 to, again, this precious opportunity doesn't last forever. We have some degree of knowledge

00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:06.880
 of the laws of karas and effect. And to some degree, we have some vision of all the challenges

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:15.600
 of samsara, either through our own direct perception or the words from the omniscient ones. And

00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:20.840
 we've taken refuge in the three jewels and the three roots, we're doing practice. The

00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:28.240
 answer to these questions is, I think, keep practicing and looking into the rich meaning

00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:42.360
 and depth of our practice. Keep practicing both meditation, silent meditation, some formless

00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:48.120
 meditation, just resting in awareness, following the pith instructions, looking to our own

00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:55.680
 mind, generating bodhicitta, and all of it, keeping with our nundra practice. But again,

00:42:55.680 --> 00:43:03.560
 all these conditions are here due to past actions and views. And by connecting with

00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:10.680
 our practice, by continuing to connect with our joy, our appreciation, our bodhicitta,

00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:15.920
 and our devotion, and following through with those things, we really, according to the

00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:24.920
 teachings, we don't have to worry. We just maintain our mindfulness, alertness, conscientiousness,

00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:31.960
 and follow through. Try to keep as authentic as we can, purify our mistakes, bring out

00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:41.320
 the beauty. So thank you. That's all I'll say for now. And we're going to take a break

00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:50.720
 from the weekly nundra now for about four weeks, at least. So we'll probably restart

00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:56.320
 towards the end of May. But we'll send out an announcement to let people know what the

00:43:56.320 --> 00:44:04.120
 schedule will be for the early summer. So thank you. Have a good evening. Happy spring.
