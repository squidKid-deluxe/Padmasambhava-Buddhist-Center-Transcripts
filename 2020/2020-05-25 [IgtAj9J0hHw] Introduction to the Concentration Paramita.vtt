00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 Thank you very much everyone for participating and helping and supporting to part of the whole

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 and we're happy with that. And now I'm going to continue again talk about what we're going

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 through, the sixth part of the essay and within the frame of the Jyabjib Duneulam, the teachings.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 So therefore, again, we're going to extend our beautiful motivation, the motivation of

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 the yoga and the applications, and as well as the vastness, the motivation of the bodhicata,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 for all sentient beings. But I'm going to reflect the teaching and the study and the listening

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 and the practice in order to benefit for all living beings. I'm going to get enlightenment

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 and help with those sentient beings, continually. From now on, until everyone reaches enlightenment

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.000
,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 may I be able to do that, really having those wishes and intentions very strongly from the

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 tip of our heart. And then we begin to practice this, or follow the teachings. So, and then

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 purely understand realization of the very inner teachings and together with the devotions.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 All those are very important. And with this thought, and then now we again go with these

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 three frames of the practices. And those are the three noblities, all three goodness and

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 beginning good, middle good, and concluding good. Those are the three. Among those three,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 we are now in the middle, we're going there. But even though it's middle, we're divided

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 like that way, but middle also has all that package, good intention, good motivation,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 bodhicata, joy and appreciation, and then practices. And then ending that with beautiful

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 aspirations, and good thought or good heart, their intentions. So everything is really

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 all completed, it's just beautiful, mud or vitamin, catch sauce, it's just everything

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 is completed. And that is how the religion, the old Buddha taught, gracious teacher, Buddha

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 taught, and all those great masters, the lineage orders are cured and put to us so that we

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 can use, it's already prepared in a way, prepared the delicatation, that we can really use and

00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 eat and then nourish our self, and heal our self, and benefit one's own self with others.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 So therefore, really also thankful, grateful for all the lineage masters who kept the teaching,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 exactly as my gracious teacher, Buddha taught, through their courage and commitment, and

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 through their compassion and the wisdom. And because of that, they are so humble, they

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 are so simple, and so daunting. Ah, so beautiful. When you're in the world, in the regular

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 world, they are perfect citizens, perfect, beautiful, ever and human being citizens,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 but who are really completely clear, woke up in their inner goals, they are truly beacon

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 of the peace, harmony, kindness, compassion. Vestos, understanding, and also respect and

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 appreciate everyone's humility, their humility, what they shared to us is just so marvelous,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 so beautiful. That's how I felt. So therefore thankful, and then really apply the teaching.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 And with this, again, we will now go into bodhicitta. It's truly what we went through,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 all these bodhicitta practices. Bodhicitta is essence. For that reason, the great master

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 of our problem will say, "Have you had one thing that will be enough to reach enlightenment,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:34.590
 that our goal in Buddhism, particularly Mahayana Buddhism, always, okay, that you get enlightenment

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:35.000
."

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 That's really always, "Oh, ah, ah, ah!" One thing that we have enough, that is bodhicitta.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 And we don't have that, this bodhicitta, no matter whatever we practice at that,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 it will not reach our goal, what we are longing, what we are enthusiastic to reach or to get,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 like to get, it won't knock at. That is bodhicitta. If we don't have that, we won't get it like

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 that.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 For that reason, bodhicitta is essence, essence of the practices. Bodhicitta can summarize

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 that in the teaching itself, compassion and emptiness. Compassion and emptiness is the

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 essence of the practices. Compassion and emptiness are no separations.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 When you got the realization of the emptiness of true nature, our compassion will be bursted.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 There is no distractions. It just bursted beyond the directions to all the living beings.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 Therefore, compassion and emptiness realization goes side by side or it goes target.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 They just stroke it, stroke it, and that is really the bodhicitta.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 First of all, our bodhicitta is kind of long, small, limited, trapped on all our ego-cling

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 activities

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 that we accumulated from the bigness times. It's trapped, it's completely locked in,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 it's coming out a little bit to guide ourselves, surviving, surviving purposes,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 incredible purpose in the society of the human world or some other. Without that, we won't get very

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 small duty.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:35.000
 Without love and compassion, we won't prescribe in this human world. Don't mention bodhicitta.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 Bodhicitta. Bodhicitta love and compassion, we already discussed, is boundness.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:51.360
 This compassion and love that we have, what we call normally, is with bound, with border, with

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.000
 limited.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 But that is also light of our coordinate nature.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 Without that, we will not survive. We will not have any premise.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 We will not really kind of nourish it or we won't have any happiness or peace at all.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 Think of that. That is bodhicitta.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 Now if you go, the cheeky Buddha teaches that discover the whole bodhicitta,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:26.000
 the one whom you have, without any border, without any walls, distractions.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 When we are completely open with that, then we need the Buddhahood, enlightenment.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000
 Then our love and compassion is limitless, boundless.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 So that is what, for those reasons, the greatest teacher, brother, gentleman,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 lay out so beautifully those six parabola practices.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 This is all practice of bodhicitta. All practice of bodhicitta.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:00.970
 To benefit ourselves, to benefit all the beings, without any discriminations or bi-healing

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:02.000
 attitudes.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 Open like sky, shining as like sunlight.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 Every direction dispels the darkness, the coldness, that ice-cold attitude of the ego-cling.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 Melting those waves gradually and bring up beautiful nature, gentle, peaceful.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 Then we become the friend of everyone, everyone.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 One of the greatest teacher, brother, chairman, his name,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 the one who is friend of all, friend of all, means all living beings.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 Buddha is a friend to all beings, whether it is introduced or not introduced.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:09:01.000
 He is a great, great friend, the permanent friend that we can realize all the time.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 Always kind, always peaceful, always caring, always concerning, and very, very practical.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 We don't ever use the word common sense, the common sense. Full of common sense, beautiful.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:31.000
 But every reason, every activity is leading us to open the door of our trailers.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:38.000
 The Buddha is teaching. Every teaching is how to open the door of our inner trailers.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 Our own kindness, completeness, and purify, or heal, remove the old obstacles.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 That's really what the greatest teacher, Buddha, is.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 So that's what I'm generally talking about. We all know that.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 But I guess, again, today is the Salah Deva.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 Salah Deva, to glorify, remembering the greatest kindness of the Buddha.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:05.000
 Shakyamuni is really marvelous. It's beautiful. It's very appealing, soothing, soothing.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000
 And so therefore, I'm really kind of talking. We all know those things. You all know them.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 So now, we go to the teaching of these amongst, again, the sixth paramatas.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 Again, the sixth paramata is the generous paramata, morality paramata, and passion paramatas,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 and joy for effort paramatas, and the concentration paramata, and burst paramatas.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 Those are the six paramatas that we all know. Again, I'm just saying that, but we all know that.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
 That was terminology. That helps me know.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 Among those six paramatas, we read the four paramatas, post-folds.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 And particularly post-three paramatas are mainly designed to help to delight our body and speech.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:12.550
 Oh, the generous paramata, morality paramata, and passion paramata is more kind of external

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:14.000
 practices,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:23.000
 external practices, outer practices, and practices of the body, practices of the speech, mainly.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 I'm talking mainly. It's a mainly. What that means, cools of mind is always there. It's no matter.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 Everything what we do is completely connected with mind.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 But it appears that generosity, morality, and the patient practices are more outreach practices.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
 Outreach, I would call it practices.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
 And joy for effort is supportive to everyone.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 I've mentioned this so many times, and it's supportive to all the paramatas.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 So it's effort. As I said yesterday or the other day, it's a moving force.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 Joy for paramata is a moving force of all the paramatas.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 We act as what really moves. So that is support.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:21.650
 But now, the concentration of the paramata and the wisdom of the paramata is more related with the

00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:25.000
 momentum, mind.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 So it's something that has to do more inwardly.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
 That's what the gracious teacher, Vrata Shakyamala, is teaching.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 Teaching is going deeper and deeper, deeper,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 and then go all the way to the ultimate level of that.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000
 So concentration of the paramata is more mental states.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000
 It's the teaching of the mind. And then wisdom too.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 Wisdom is mind. But of course, wisdom is the eye of all the paramatas.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 It is the eye, wisdom, of all the paramatas.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
 So now, today is the concentration we talk about again.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 Then is it about the mind?

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
 And now, again, we're really talking about the mind, and we all know.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:17.000
 Mind is the rule of the samsara and the nirvana.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 Both the samsara and the nirvana are ruled by the mind.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
 According to the Buddha teaching, produced by the mind.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:35.000
 Both are real. Both the samsara and the nirvana are displayed

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 and ruled, displayed and ruled, maintained by the mind.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
 So mind is the ruler of everything.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 And that's the thing in the samsara levels, how mind is so important.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:57.000
 When we say I'm happy, who is really identifying the same?

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:05.000
 Reality is mind. It's true or not, you can reflect that.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 And when I'm sad, will I say, again, fundamental,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
 who is identifying saying that? It's mind.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 Or I'm really, everything is good. When I say, who is that?

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 It's mind. And I'm all not good at everything.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
 It's also mind. So samsara levels.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:38.000
 And then all the cause of samsara, cause of samsara, duality is mind.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
 Think of that. It's true or not.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000
 Corrected teacher, Buddha is so open.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
 It's so open.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000
 He said, what I said, Buddha said, what I said,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 you don't have to trust, you can examine.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 You don't have to say, oh, because Buddha said, I have to believe.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000
 This is not believing. This is an analytic.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 And this time, we're not doing big analytic things in a grade,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
 those philosophy, which is a school.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
 They do a lot of analytics, debate, back and forth things,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 but we are doing more approach, more kind of easy way to do practice,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 easy way to reach the goal and prove.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000
 Prove. But still, somebody, we need confidence.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
 Confidence and all certainties.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000
 And for that reason, we should also to analyze this simple way.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 This is not big analyze, analyze.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:46.000
 So when we say duality is the cause of samsara.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 And what it produced?

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000
 It produced the gross level of ego cleanings.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
 It's also mind.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 It's produced result of the dualities.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:06.000
 When we have the ego cleanings, then it has all the emotions coming,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
 such as I'm talking negative emotions.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 Ignorance is right there with the egos.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
 It's just a trigger that they have.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 Shadow and body, they trigger them.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 Most when you have the ignorance, immediately there is attachment,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
 then comes.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 Attachment, those are outcoming emotions, now negative emotions.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
 Attachment, that noticeable, that comes.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:37.000
 And then anger, ghettos, heavy thought, doubt and hesitations,

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 all that variety emotions come from that.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:48.000
 And the great teacher, Buddha pointed out there is six root negative emotions.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 Twenty-some negative emotions, those are just like gross.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000
 Gross, otherwise what in the teaching said.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 The eighty, twenty, twenty-one thousand of the attachment emotions,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000
 twenty-one thousand of the anger emotions,

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:20.000
 twenty-one thousand of the ignorant emotions,

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:27.000
 and twenty-one thousand of the all three emotions, or three target emotions.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000
 Those are basically eighty-four thousand different negative emotions

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.000
 in order to subdue, in order to dispel, in order to last form.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 Those eighty-four thousand of the emotions would have gave eighty-four thousand of the teachings.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 Those are the teachings said.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.000
 There are so many emotions, but the root of this, the troublemaker,

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 the root troublemaker is ego clinging, or the jwari thought,

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 the clinging, grasping, clinging, that's what teaching said.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:09.000
 But that jagantra, that troublemaker, that such an enormous troublemaker,

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 of the all lifetimes, not just the one lifetime, but whole lifetime.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:25.000
 Where is that? Again it's mine. It's all the star of our mind.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.000
 The whole troublemaker, what the great Master Shanti Deva says,

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:36.000
 it is this ego, this eye knocking the cling on the eye of the ego,

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000
 is the troublemaker, so many troubles.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 It is the greatest demon, demon, this is great demon.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:53.000
 So why can this demon, demon who is making so much trouble to me,

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 to my friends, to my fellow citizens of the sentient beings,

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000
 why I should keep that?

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:06.000
 That's what really is so great, clearly, loudly important.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 It's true. It's the ego clinging.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000
 But that's the mind, again.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:19.000
 And then it's bodhicitta, which is loving kindness, compassion, bodhicitta,

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000
 all those beautiful things, which is the cause to the nirvana,

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000
 cause to the enlightenment.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 And the Muslim, again, why is that? It's the mind.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:39.000
 So both the enlightenment gauntlet of the old nirvana, or the path truth,

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 and the necessary truths coming from the mind,

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:51.000
 and all the suffering truth and the cause of suffering coming from the mind.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:59.000
 This is the reason, so important to deal with direct to the troublemaker,

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 or direct to the source, or direct to the boss,

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.000
 instead of going to the different branches in this and that.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000
 Go to the boss, boss.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:17.000
 That is what this concentration is, is really going to the boss.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:25.000
 We turn that boss right direction, that boss will help us and bring our enlightenment,

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000
 the beautiful goal, the realizations.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000
 And we continue, clearly, with the same old habit, same thing,

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.000
 this boss is making unending troubles, difficulties,

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000
 challenges, one after another, to myself.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.000
 We talk with that, as we talk, we go cleanly with myself and my friends,

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 my family members, my loved ones, my fellow citizens, and my sentient beings.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.000
 It's making all that trouble. So who is going to handle that?

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000
 No one else is going to help you with that.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000
 Gregor Chicha, Buddha Kya Kya Manu said, "I show you the techniques."

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:13.000
 Now, you, the one, have to put on the skills, you have to put in actions.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:22.000
 I cannot choose to take away or clean away your cleanings, your obscurations.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000
 You create it, you have to clean it.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 For example, Buddha Kya Kya Manu, he did obscurations, also he cleaned it.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 All that practice and meditations of the three countless ills, same way.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000
 And all that this great Bodhisattvas, great enlightened beings,

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000
 great masters of the India and activities, when we read life stories,

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:55.000
 they become great enlightened beings because they clean way, all that obstacles.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000
 By themselves, they've got the skill and the techniques and the methods

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:05.000
 from the teacher and the Buddha's teaching that I showed them how to clean,

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:12.000
 how to purify, how to make that rejuvenating from their own mistakes.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 They did it. And we have the same capabilities, same opportunities.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000
 Now we have to click ourselves.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:28.000
 This is the time to wake up. This is the time to get up.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:36.000
 This is the time to bounce back to our tracks of the path to the enlightenment.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000
 Path to the enlightenment, we should do that.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:51.000
 That is known as the attitude, the willingness, motivations, determinations of the practitioners.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 That's what we do.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:59.000
 How we do this is not just a classic song, but we are going to bounce back

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:05.000
 to our old, natural status and bring such a beautiful, really intentional thought,

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:10.000
 change from the fundamentals, as I said, from the boss.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 The boss of this mind is thinking all the time, ego thinks, me, I, minds, and all that things.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:24.000
 But now at least with this, I'm going to think of all the living beings.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000
 Every living being is mine. Every living being is so kind.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.000
 Every living being is up because their kindness I'm going to get enlightened.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000
 Buddha showed the path in the teaching of the great masters,

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000
 asked us to talk to the reminder of the practice,

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.000
 but actually who's going to put us on the practice and who's going to put us training,

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.000
 that training, and who's going to help us is sentient beings.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:54.000
 Sentient beings are going to help us to reach the enlightenment.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.000
 Sentient beings are going to help me to fulfill my generous parameters.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:05.000
 Sentient beings are going to help me to fulfill my morality parameters.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 And sentient beings are going to help me to fulfill my goal of the patient parameters.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.000
 And sentient beings are going to help me to my portfolio

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.000
 of the giant parameters or concentrated parameters.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:28.000
 Therefore, they're all so kind, so supportive for our goodness, for our good goals.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:34.000
 We know the sentient beings in the teaching said, we will not reach enlightenment.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:39.000
 There's no place but to learn and improve.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 So therefore, we will train for attitude and then we lead the practices.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:53.000
 So now, we discussed already all those three parameters earlier that we've done,

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000
 but now, the unparameter.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000
 The concentration, as I said already, you all know.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.000
 I'm not talking that because you don't know.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:06.000
 I'm just talking in a way reminded to all of us what the great teacher,

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000
 Brother Jackman told, what is the concentration requirement.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000
 So now, the mind is so important.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:17.000
 Again, in fact, therefore, we need concentrators.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000
 We don't have the concentration in the teaching.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.000
 No matter how much you do good things, it's all scattered.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:30.000
 If we don't have the concentration, that means all the emotions

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:35.000
 are just waiting to get the opportunity or chance.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000
 They're just waiting.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.000
 That we have the good concentration we can pursue.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000
 These emotions are just kind of naive in a way.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.000
 They're portrayed as naive, naive and kind of hiding behind the bushes.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000
 As soon as they got the chance, they will attract us.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000
 But if we are vigilant with good concentrations taught,

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000
 then they have no strength.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000
 They will go away.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:08.000
 And therefore, concentration is so, so important and so special.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000
 For that reason, the great teacher, Brother Jackman,

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:18.000
 taught the patient concentration requirements, the young requirements.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 So that is my kind of great talk about concentrations today.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000
 And now I'm not going to – you all know, Jan, that is all this.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:31.000
 And then I'm going to continue this when we resume the next time our retreat.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000
 I will continue to talk about the paramatas

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.000
 and all these other things and follow the teachings of the Japatunu,

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:45.000
 which is teaching this hard advice for the 14th ones.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000
 I'm going to continue.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000
 So that's really that I'm going to stop here.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:55.000
 But because why I'm stopping here early, five, ten minutes early,

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000
 and because I really like to talk.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.000
 Again, this is Sagada. Sagada practices.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:06.000
 Sagada is, again, so important, according that you all know.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000
 And you can read so many books.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000
 And I'm sure you know so many, many great masters of Tibetan.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:18.000
 Everyone respect and honor and recognize this one of the really important practices.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000
 All the Tibetans really do, do.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:26.000
 And so therefore, I just really like to talk again about the Sagada one.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:31.000
 Actually, I will mention about taking the perceptors, head perceptors,

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:35.000
 which is the shortest perceptors in the Buddha teaching.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000
 It's 24 hours a day.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:42.000
 And then traditionally, that also merges with traditional lineage teaching

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000
 of Geollam or Pang.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.000
 Geollam, a very famous Buddhist nun,

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000
 the enlightenment or the practice of Avalokini Shora.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000
 And head lineage teaching,

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:59.000
 it becomes so popular and innovative that it is known as "nuni" practices.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:05.000
 So these 24 hour practices that become the nuni lineages,

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:12.000
 they use the practices for 48 hours, I think, two days.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000
 So that means how they do that.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000
 And of course, many of you already know,

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000
 but a few of you don't exactly familiar with that.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.000
 They do practice, for example, taking the vows,

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000
 and let's say this morning, morning,

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:30.000
 and then keep that vow and eat the lunch, keeping that vow.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000
 Eat, have the one lunch, the vegetarian lunch,

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.000
 and then have continued practicing on the Avalokini Shora.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.000
 Geollam is cultivating the compassion, allowing kindness,

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.000
 bodhijana, basically, bodhijana, deciding and practicing.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000
 Geollam continues to see.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:55.000
 And then they do practice, continue, and whole night.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.000
 And the next day, then even they don't eat any food,

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.000
 they don't eat any or drink anything.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000
 And, for example, sorry, I forgot.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 And this aprono, for example, you take the vow this morning,

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:12.000
 aprono, they're also stopping, they're talking or communicating with them,

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 and just only practicing.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.000
 Reciting a month of practicing, and just continue doing that,

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:24.000
 and whole day, afternoon, and whole evening, as much as you can,

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000
 and until the morning.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:35.000
 And the morning, again, you take, renew your vows one more time.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:40.000
 And then, tomorrow, you won't eat anything, you won't talk anything,

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000
 and even you don't drink anything,

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.000
 unless you have the advice from the doctor,

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000
 or if you feel you need it for the health reason,

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000
 then, of course, you can.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 But otherwise, won't eat, won't drink,

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:00.000
 won't function or talk to anyone, so speaking, talking,

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000
 except to practice, reciting the month.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:07.000
 So that means, that practicing is what I call a tiki.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.000
 The whole poem is transformed into our lokrihora,

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.000
 and the whole song system is transformed

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:18.000
 on the mantra of the karese, our lokrihora, our mānipipiho,

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 and all mind, and thought are transformed

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000
 upon a loving kindness, compassion, wisdom,

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:30.000
 and a great emptiness, and continually meditate.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.000
 And the following day, so that means tomorrow,

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000
 day after tomorrow, 8 in the morning, then they get up,

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000
 and do some practice one more time,

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000
 and then they come out of the pasting,

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000
 and then they complete the uni practice.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.000
 That's called uni practices, uni practices.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:55.000
 So that is like, as I said, 48 hours.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.000
 48 hours, they practice it, but you take a while,

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:04.000
 it was renewed a while, after you finished it, 24 hours.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.000
 So that is uni practices.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.000
 Then, just generally, uni practices,

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:15.000
 uni, and uni is slightly different, but it's the same,

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000
 and that is 24 hours.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000
 That you can do, too.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.000
 And those who don't feel too like to do,

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.000
 and you can do that.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000
 That is at perseptice.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.000
 And as I said yesterday, those who are interested

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000
 to do that during this summer,

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.000
 which is multiple, even if you do 24 hours,

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.000
 3 days is so wonderful, and you can take a while

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.000
 to get that from the shrines, your only shrine.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:43.000
 Your only shrine is the living corner of the Gurdwara,

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.000
 to the Buddha Chaktamuni, and Gurdwara Maasambhava,

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000
 and the Dara, and all the Buddhas, the Bodhisattvas.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000
 And really, that is living.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.000
 That is shrine, not just the stages of straining there,

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.000
 or the bhakti or something.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000
 Truly, that is really the Buddhas.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000
 Where do we think the Buddha in the teaching says,

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000
 the Buddha will be there?

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000
 The moment you think, the Buddha will be right there.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.000
 Whoever thinks.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000
 And not just there, but will bless him.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000
 Will bless him.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000
 And that's what also same as Gurdwara Maasambhava.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000
 And when Gurdwara Maasambhava departed from Tibet,

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000
 so many people are upset and said,

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000
 they said, "Oh, we will miss you

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.000
 without going to God see that."

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000
 When Gurdwara Maasambhava said that,

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.000
 "I never went away, or going to go anywhere."

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.000
 Particularly those who are devoted to me,

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.000
 I will be right with you.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.000
 I will be right with you.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.000
 And it's really true.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000
 So many great masters and practitioners have witnessed

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 since eight centuries, until now, in innovators.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000
 Great masters have witnessed.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000
 Great general ridiculous practitioners

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000
 and the layperson, man and woman have witnessed.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.000
 It's really that, for that reason.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:59.000
 That's what Gurdwara Maasambhava did not go anywhere

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.000
 and treat those who are devoted.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000
 He's always there.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000
 And the Dara is the same.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000
 All the master great beings,

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.000
 enlightened beings, they don't have the distance

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.000
 between time and space.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000
 For some of these modern technologies,

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000
 we're using this technology as no time

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000
 or no difference between space and time.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000
 We're really digging now, everywhere, I mean.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.000
 Wherever that is, that is the technologies.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.000
 But when you develop the truly technology

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.000
 of the enlightenment goal,

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000
 it's a trillion times, according to teaching,

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000
 more powerful, more strong.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000
 Actually, there's no numbers.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:48.000
 The power of the enlightenment is so strong and deep.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000
 And therefore, a few strong persons

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.000
 make nice offerings, nice energy.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.000
 As I said, it's generalist practices.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.000
 Nice energy is moralist practices.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000
 Even if you spend some time,

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000
 there's that patient practices.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000
 And concentrate with joy and effort.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000
 That is a reality.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000
 Joy for effort.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000
 And concentrate on that is beyond constitutive parameters.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000
 And clearly understand what you're doing.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.000
 Really, with devotion, that is what's in the parameters.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000
 And do three-fold stations.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000
 Like any many people in three-fold stations,

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.000
 sit down, and then in front of the shrine,

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.000
 check that wall three times.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000
 And then you can visualize,

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000
 all the Buddhas you have last heard,

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000
 limited blessings, gave you that.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.000
 Blessings, blessings, blessings.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000
 And then you talk, that's the wall.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.000
 You talk about it.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000
 At that moment, then Buddhas,

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000
 (speaks in foreign language)

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000
 and all the enlightenment,

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000
 with you doing the human practice,

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.000
 or with you in the practice.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.000
 That is, and you do the practice all the time.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.000
 In the next day, when you put 24 hours a year,

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000
 the next day, they dedicated their merit.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 All the sentient beings.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000
 Dedicated their merit for all the healing purposes.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000
 Everyone's really dedicated.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000
 That is a great contribution,

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.000
 for peace and harmony, for the world,

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000
 for mankind, for the six realms.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000
 It's really so powerful.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.000
 That is practice.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.000
 And then during the Saladhava time,

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.000
 we as much as we choose practice.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.000
 We choose practice.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.000
 And that means the world.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:36.000
 And avoid the negatives, as much as we can.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000
 Negatives, as we said the other day,

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:43.000
 I mean you all know, there is 10 negative,

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.000
 negatives, sorry, negatives.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.000
 10 negatives, you know.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.000
 Three by the mind, so three by the body,

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:56.000
 four by the speech, and three by the mind.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:03.000
 And that all together is called 10 negatives, 10 unrighteous.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.000
 That you all know.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000
 I list it to you all the days.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000
 But again I will list it.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:13.000
 Three by the body, not taking, and not stealing,

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000
 and not sexual misconducts.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.000
 Those are the three by the bodies.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000
 And then four by the speech,

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:29.000
 and which is not lying, not slender, not gossiping,

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000
 not harsh speech.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000
 Those are the four by the speech.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.000
 And then three by the mind,

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:45.000
 is not, what's called, not covetous.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:50.000
 Covetous, covetous, and not violent thought,

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.000
 not wrong ideas, wrong beliefs.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.000
 Those are the three by the mind.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:01.000
 So avoiding that, itself is vicious.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.000
 But during the silent double,

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.000
 trying to do also, not just avoiding that,

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.000
 do some kind of like opposite of that.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.000
 Opposite of that, what that means.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.000
 Opposite of not taking lives.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.000
 If you don't know, protecting lives, which is wonderful.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.000
 Lives of any living beings, that's wonderful.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.000
 But above that, what in the teaching said,

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.000
 so the plural protecting lives of any sentient beings.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.000
 Not just the taking lives of that,

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.000
 but plural protecting lives of sentient beings

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000
 as much as you have the covetous.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:39.000
 Including the peace, insect, according to Buddhism.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:44.000
 Insects or anything that you can protect,

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.000
 lives or others, it is vicious.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.000
 The Buddhas will be delighted to see that.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.000
 Garabhamasambhava and the Tharas and all the Bodhisattvas

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.000
 will be delighted to see, really.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.000
 They will be rejoiced at that.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:05.000
 And then, not taking blood with others,

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.000
 that itself is vicious.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:12.000
 But above that, then, to generosity.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000
 Generacy parameters.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:18.000
 As much as you can do, according to your capability.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.000
 Even to the homeless persons.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.000
 One cup of the glass, one cup of the coffees.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:26.000
 Or something can be even small things.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:31.000
 Really with respect, kind of reflecting our compassion

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000
 in the form of generosity.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.000
 And generously, I will mention, and you all know,

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.000
 there is a variety of generous practices

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.000
 that we went through, one after another.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.000
 Know that, and do whatever you can do.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:50.000
 That is also a generous department of practices.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:53.000
 Generous parliament of practices.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.000
 Then, the sexual misconduct.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.000
 Sexual misconduct is, again, not knowing that,

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000
 it is selfish and vicious.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.000
 But not just that, but above that,

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.000
 take a vow, such as 24 hours.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.000
 Vowels.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:15.000
 All that renewing, renewing our obasaka vowels.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:18.000
 Obasaka vowels, those are the morality.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.000
 What is obasaka vowels?

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.000
 Poor root, and pipe one,

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.000
 and all targeted on the pipe receptors.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.000
 That is generally the obasaka vow of the lay practice

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000
 and the Buddhist, those who want to take that vowels.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000
 Those are the vowels, which is the moralities.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:39.000
 And that is, again, poor root one with what?

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:43.000
 That not killing, not stealing,

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:47.000
 and not sexual misconduct, and not lying.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.000
 Those are the root of the vowels,

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000
 foundation of the vowels.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.000
 Above that, not toxicating.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:00.000
 That makes part, renewing that vowels,

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.000
 which is, then, known as moralities.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.000
 Moralities.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.000
 And then, the next one is,

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.000
 yeah, and then you all know that.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.000
 You went through that the other day,

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.000
 you know that, then just really do those things.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000
 And therefore, also, and then each time when you do,

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.000
 do that with good intention, with bodhicaka.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.000
 And of course, you're doing that with the intention,

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:30.000
 but at that moment when you do it,

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.000
 bring out your body, and turn your body together,

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:36.000
 and then you get in that meditate for the living beings,

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:40.000
 to bring all peace, to spell all the trouble

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.000
 that we're going out through, these troubles.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:45.000
 And as well as everyone's reading.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.000
 That just really kind of frees them.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:53.000
 And that also everything is completely within the frame

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:58.000
 of the three, beginning novel, middle novel, and concluding novels.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.000
 Beginning novel, for example, generalism practice,

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.000
 even the small things that you do, generalistic,

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.000
 start with the really conventional loving kind of folk,

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.000
 and giving that to those individual generalists,

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:14.000
 with respect and with polite and nice men living there,

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.000
 with them, and then after that one with finish.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:20.000
 Also, what you got to merit, again, from this,

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.000
 I've dedicated that for all living beings

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000
 like peace, harmonics, and the duality,

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.000
 which they're sensitive from that,

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.000
 and therefore reaching enlightenment,

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.000
 myself and others, for benefit of sentient beings.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:37.000
 That is a complete practice, total practices, complete.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.000
 Even that looks like it's kind of small,

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.000
 but then there is all the different kind of community services,

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:47.000
 as I said, those are all really wonderful, wonderful, good.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.000
 Of course, this time we have to be very poor,

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.000
 but those any community service,

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000
 all help with the Dharma centers,

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000
 help in supporting them, whatever.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.000
 You can do small in a big way.

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.000
 It's a beautiful principle, and beautiful reasons.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000
 It really is a community merit.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.000
 A community merit, what's a merit is? Merit is.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.000
 So that is really my talk,

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:14.000
 and again, a reminder of the saladawah,

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.000
 and happy saladawah to everyone, okay?

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.000
 And then of course, now we do continue our practices,

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:26.000
 and now this time we're going to concluding our healing retreat,

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.000
 right, in these days,

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:34.000
 and then so we won't have any teachings or the Zoom practices,

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:38.000
 all that for until the next week,

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:41.000
 which will be the birthday of the Buddha Chaturmunis,

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.000
 according to our calendars.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:48.000
 So we come together, Friday, this coming Friday,

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:58.000
 because it's also June 5, I think.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.000
 So it comes June 5, that time, then we come back.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.000
 Again, we're due.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:09.000
 So Lama Lai is going to announce those in the Zoom,

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.000
 so you will look there and see that.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:16.000
 But anyway, so that's what we're really going to do the practice,

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:19.000
 then we'll Zoom again for another three days.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000
 Friday, Saturday, Sunday,

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:25.000
 that's what we're going to do the practice as we've been doing,

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000
 and then the teaching, and then the practices,

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:31.000
 and get talking, whoever has time, please join with us that time,

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:35.000
 like that, and then so we will start again for five days,

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.000
 or two days, and then we'll Zoom back again,

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.000
 following Friday and Saturday and Sunday like that.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:46.000
 So we'll go online for a while, and in June like that.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.000
 So that's our kind of schedules.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:57.000
 And then, of course, Lama Lai will announce that in a trashy day like bullet.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.000
 The 29th is when we start.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.000
 And it will go until the 29th of June.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:06.000
 29th of June, so we do like that, stop and do that.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.000
 And we told also that maybe it's more suitable to everyone,

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:14.000
 because now everything is opening up, and all that, we have to do all that.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:19.000
 So and then for those reasons, we thought maybe it's better to do that way.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.000
 So that's our thought.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:26.000
 So Dharma Center, everything is really gradually opening with cautiously,

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:30.000
 and also our farm-baked Dharma Center in Florida,

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.000
 and as well as a natural Dharma Center,

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:38.000
 and also opening so you can look locally in their bullet news,

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:42.000
 and which is supposed to be this in the coming Tuesday,

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:46.000
 will have the evening practice of the heart shutters.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:51.000
 All that you can look to your own bullet board of the...

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.000
 Virtual.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:55.000
 Virtual, virtual, virtual practices, all that.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:59.000
 I mean, you please look, okay, I'm maybe not announced very correctly,

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.000
 but you look to those places,

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:05.000
 and then really resume the practice with, again, very thoughtful,

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.000
 very respectful of each other.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:10.000
 So if somebody goes, something happened,

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:15.000
 that due to our unkind of like mindfulness, then it's really not good.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.000
 So they are always thoughtful,

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.000
 which is the teaching of the great teacher Buddha Chaitanya,

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:24.000
 which is respectful, thoughtful, and very, very practical way,

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:28.000
 and then move forward our practice in meditation,

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.000
 all good activities, okay?

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.000
 So that's our thought,

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:35.000
 and now we do short, again, meditation,

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.000
 and then we do healing, actually.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000
 Thank you very much, everyone.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:42.000
 Really, body speed, and coming, and together, and the support,

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:45.000
 and thank you so much, everyone.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.000
 I'm so thankful, and all Sangha members of the Messiah,

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:53.000
 and very happy, and very, very delightful.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.000
 Thank you very much, everyone, okay?

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.000
 Thank you. Now we do short meditation.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.000
 Thank you.
