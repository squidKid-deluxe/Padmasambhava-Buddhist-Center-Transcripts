00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.120
 What is really now positive? For example, let's think of the positive mind. Positive mind is again

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.000
 one very simple, a very simple one.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:21.030
 Positive mind is joy, what we talk. Appreciation, peaceful, calm, and soothing, and kindness and

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:22.000
 compassion.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:31.680
 That is really what is old, is the positive mind. And again, if we bring down that mind to the more

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.000
 kind of like precisely or trying to more summarize,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 then in simple nature, love and kindness and compassion is the positive mind.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.840
 If we bring down the positive mind, then the positive mind is the positive mind, the positive mind

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.000
 is the positive mind.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.830
 If we bring down the positive mind, then the positive mind is the positive mind, and the positive

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.000
 mind is the positive mind.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:18.260
 If we bring down the positive mind, then the positive mind is the positive mind, the positive mind

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:24.000
 is the positive mind.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:32.500
 Now, this is not that what we have to do this. In the Buddha's teaching, let it glow yourself in

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.000
 that status.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.410
 Become yourself. This is our mind. Let that energy prevail throughout the system of our body, our

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.000
 mind, our spirit.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.040
 That is enough, it is not enough. You must share that. Sharing that love and kindness and

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.000
 compassion, joy and compassion to the others.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.310
 That is known as then the actualizing body japa. You are actualizing. You let that glow, not

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.000
 limited to that.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.640
 To our self, with again some degree of the ego and thought. You let that shape, let that glow with

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.000
 only in the boundary, with only in the restructuring.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.420
 And that is known as then the practicing the dharma, practicing dharma to ourselves, and practicing

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.000
 dharma, that benefiting, helping to the others.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:33.720
 That means you share that. If you don't understand that, then you will have to go to the other side

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.000
.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 If you don't understand that, then you will have to go to the other side.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 If you don't understand that, then you will have to go to the other side.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 If you don't understand that, then you will have to go to the other side.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 If you don't understand that, then you will have to go to the other side.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 If you don't understand that, then you will have to go to the other side.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 If you don't understand that, then you will have to go to the other side.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 Now, say why that you mean this. And then one way again, another, one simple way again to practice

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 means dharma or the positive mind.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 It means not hurting anyone, hurting anyone. That means non-violence.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 Be non-violence to your self and non-violence to others.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 That is really dharma. When we start connecting negative thought, it hurt ourself, it hurt others.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:35.130
 So violence is not just gross things, but violence is also one way, very practical way, very simple

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.000
 kind of way.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 And not hurting your self and not hurting to the other, that is really dharma, that is practice.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 That only performance and ignite into that quality.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 That is then joy and appreciation, love in the highest temperatures.
