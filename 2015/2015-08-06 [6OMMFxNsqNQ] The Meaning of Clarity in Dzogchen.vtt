00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.990
 "I want to make sure I understand what you mean by clarity. Is it when you're very relaxed, but

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:29.980
 alert, and in noticing whatever happens without labeling it?"

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.960
 "Yes, those are all, but this time also clarity means when you're meditating, when you're med

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.980
itating and have the quality of the clarity."

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:51.680
 "So that means, if I use examples, for example, like examples of the sky, the outer skies, the sky

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.980
 is always open, open to all, always this vastness."

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:06.600
 "But certain times, certain times, the sky looks so bright, so clear, what you say, clear crystal,

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.980
 clear crystal, that we see sometimes."

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:20.470
 "That kind of qualities, in the meditation, we can kind of bring out, that is known as clarity,

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:28.680
 basically. But this clarity, generally, again, we're not bringing something is not there with the

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.980
 nature of the mind."

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:44.980
 "According to Dzogchen, this clarity is sambukaya, sambukaya of the nature of the mind."

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:51.840
 "So, in Dzogchen teaching, what is it, this nature of the mind, what we're talking frame of the

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.980
 wisdom, it has emptiness, it has clarity, it has active energy."

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:07.600
 "And now, we divided this nature of the mind, we can't explain three things, empty, clarity, or the

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.980
 luminosity, and then active energy."

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.980
 "So, that was three aspects, three aspects of the nature of the mind."

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:22.970
 "What means, emptiness, when you look to your mind, or when we're talking looking to the lookers,

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.980
 moment you look to the lookers, there's nothing really can find."

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:37.980
 "And that is, basically, emptiness of the mind. Then, this mind has that energy."

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:46.110
 "Energy, two things come up, comes up, it's already there, it's already there, it's inseparable, it

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.980
's there, that energy is there."

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:56.000
 "That energy, what is that energy, that clarity is not just clarity in light, but it is clarity,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:03.980
 that means it's compassion, it's loving kindness, it's wisdom, that is really clarity."

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:10.280
 "If we summarize that, that energy is with that emptiness mind, emptiness one, neither any separ

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:16.980
ations, that is clarity, that is emptiness, it's emptiness, that is clarity, that's the one."

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:30.630
 "That is what, that energy, we're talking here of the great Mahatma Shambhava Sorana, is saying,

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.980
 trying to kind of raise up that energy, or that brain, without effort, just it's naturally there,

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.980
 it's trying to kind of lift up that."

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.980
 "And when you do that, then it's again in the teaching set, as I said all the day."

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:45.410
 "Relies in the gazing, a little bit up in the space, and then when you do that, naturally, that

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:54.030
 emptiness meditations, of the meditation will become a little more clear, more kind of clarity, or

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.980
 a little bit bright."

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:03.180
 "And now, this prompt, that combination of these both, what's called clarity, emptiness, then what

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.980
 is coming, third one, is called active energy."

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.980
 "Active energy, what is this active energy? It's our thinking."

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:18.020
 "Each of this chain, our thought, now what we're talking, is active energy of that emptiness and

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.980
 clarity."

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:24.980
 "This active energy is also not lost in the quality of the emptiness and clarity."

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:31.430
 "It is, for example, this wrong thing is told, our thoughts are coming, the chain of thoughts are

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.980
 coming, but it is, immediately,"

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:44.280
 "Doesn't let them out, dissolve, and redefine again, with intelligence, intelligence, or analyz

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.980
ation, this from analyzation."

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:53.290
 "This is called display, active energy of the energy, and in the zooki teaching, it's called namak

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.980
ayas."

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.980
 "This namakayas, namakayas."

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:03.280
 "And even though it's divided, all those three kind of, the divided aspects, but they're all in the

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:03.980
 same."

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:11.980
 "It's not really coming three different places. It's all, it's all in, in all."

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:18.980
 "Thank you so much for your work. Thank you. Thank you, thank you, you're welcome. Thank you."
