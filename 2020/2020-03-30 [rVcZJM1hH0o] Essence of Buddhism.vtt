00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.390
 Thank you again. Good afternoon. Welcome, everyone. Thank you. Now I give short talks, which is a

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:16.600
 reminder of our practices.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:25.920
 So we follow the instructions of the great master of his humble Dzogchen. As I spoke a little bit

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:33.320
 about how this teaching came from and his story of how that happened,

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:40.520
 also I think I mentioned it already, and of course it's nothing too difficult to know. You can

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:46.360
 understand that easily. But now this, again, the teaching itself begins here.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:01:08.230
 Here, in this head, my glass. Here, in this head, to check the full advantage of the life that is

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.080
 so difficult to obtain.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:17.390
 From here, in the world, which is almost this end of the world, that is really the teachings. This

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.600
 teaching is the essence teachings of the entire Buddha teachings.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.400
 What that means, the entire teaching of the Buddha Chaturman.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:38.110
 Buddha reached enlightenment or become the Buddha, according to his story, as age 35. From age 35

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.320
 onwards, Antrahi entered Mahaparinirana.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:52.510
 They gave the varieties of teachings to all the living beings. According to their capabilities,

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.160
 their readiness, the Buddha gave the teachings.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:06.050
 These teachings are according to what they should, to the individuals. Buddha knows exactly how to

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:12.560
 give, how to share, how to develop their spiritual realizations.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:22.280
 Buddha never opposed. But every single teaching, so what he gave, all that teaching goes directly

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.600
 to revealing one's own energy and nature.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:33.880
 Buddha's teaching is known as the teaching of the natural. Exactly where things are, where they

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:34.840
 should be.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:45.540
 It's not exaggerated, not overstated or understated, where things as it's simple. Just simple. Pr

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.480
ank directly. That is what this teaching is.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:59.890
 That teaching is also non-volence. Teaching is peaceful. Teaching is equal to all the living beings

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:00.200
.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.970
 This is not just a Buddha mad at that because he taught the good, but actually that's the way

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.000
 things are. Everyone is equal.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:20.760
 As I mentioned yesterday, and as well as you all know, it's equal. Every level we all equal.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:28.210
 Natural level, that means the nature of the mind, the importance of our individual, our own beings

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:29.640
 is also equal.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:36.750
 The gracious kindness compared to the teacher said loudly, "There is no difference between the

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:43.560
 Buddha himself as well as all the living beings. We are all equal."

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:54.490
 Because when he becomes a Buddha, he pursues that true energy, natural, as inherited, with courage,

00:03:54.490 --> 00:04:04.440
 commitment, confidence, determination, combined with love, compassion, joy and appreciation.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:12.170
 This is also all. This is what I'm talking about, courage, commitment, determination, love and

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:20.230
 compassion. Those who can't be very fancy or extraordinary, but reality is our nature, your nature

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.120
 and my nature.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:32.520
 Buddha pursues that true nature as it is, without diluted or deluded by the duality conceptions. He

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:40.260
 really maintains that's what he becomes fully aware to others, free from old obscurities, negat

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.720
ivities, ego clings, self-important, self-centered models.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:53.090
 So that is what they really owe to. This teaching is even though short, looks like simple. Reality

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.520
 contains all the teachings.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:04.520
 All 35, oh sorry 45 years of the Buddha's teaching are condensed in this mega powerful summary

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:12.120
 teachings by His Holiness of the Universe, something easy to digest it, easy to cooperate with it,

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.720
 easy to activate it,

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:20.850
 easily can apply to every aspect of our lives, not just only during the sitting meditation or

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:29.180
 sitting practices. Practice means generally, practice all time, means maintaining always on the

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.720
 natural skills, way things are.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:41.170
 What did the teaching say always? Meditation and post-meditations. For the practitioner, those who

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:47.720
 do a retreat, then the practicing or the meditation state is longer.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:56.630
 They do for example 24 hours, we look 24 hours, how long they practice. They practice maybe 80% of

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:04.740
 the 24 hours meditating, cultivating, relaxing, reflecting the teaching that they learned, they

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:11.720
 received, they are observing it in the heart center, activating that nature.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:19.850
 But mostly every individual, as many of us, how much we practice, everything percentage of the 24

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:30.720
 hours. Maybe 2 hours, 1.5 hours, or 1 hour, those may be good times.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:39.690
 When we are busy, when we are rushed, maybe it just do 5 minute practice, maybe that's it. In 24

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:46.720
 hours, 5-10 minutes of practice is not very much, not very much.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:54.380
 Even if we are sitting in one glass, one cup of the struggle of coffee, it will take 10 minutes,

00:06:54.380 --> 00:07:01.720
 more than 10 minutes. So think of that, I am talking practical level, but we follow that.

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:09.260
 Every 10-15 minutes, we think we practice, oh I practice this 15 minutes, but reality is touch down

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.720
 to the ground and think in the reflector depth.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:19.920
 Practice means we are not practicing to please the Buddhas or please someone that. Practice means

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:27.720
 to improve ourselves, glorify our beautiful good naturals, from the way nature is.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:36.640
 Glorify our loving kindness, our compassion, our understanding, then after all our mindfulness,

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:37.720
 alertness.

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:46.000
 This is good for me, is good for my family, friends, neighbors and whole countries. That's true, it

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.720
's not just exaggerating and making stories.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:59.490
 Nobody can really deny on that. That's what the Buddha taught. So now what Buddha taught, all those

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:06.720
 teachings, 45 years of teachings can be summarized into 3 teachings that you all know.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:13.830
 As I said earlier, I am reminding you all to read so many teachings from many great masters, as

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:17.720
 well as I am sure you read so many books.

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:25.390
 There are so many really beautiful books, teachings are not translated. Everything is your reach,

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:27.720
 our reach. So I am sure you read.

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:35.620
 But entirely teaching can be summarized into 3 teachings. Those are known as 3 basket teachings or

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:37.720
 in the way they know some.

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:48.520
 Basket, Vinaya basket, Sutra basket, Abhidharma basket. What does that mean? Basket. Basket means

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:51.720
 Vinaya is not just a single one or single Vinaya.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:59.720
 It contains all the good Buddhas. What are those Buddhas? But generally, what are teaching?

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:06.890
 Again, the meaning of these 3 basket teachings summarizes what can be understood. Those are known

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:14.720
 as morality teaching, concentration teaching, concentration teaching, as well as wisdom teaching.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:28.520
 So Abhidharma alone contains all these 3. Vinaya teaching is the principle of teaching on the

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:39.720
 morality or conduct, ethics, but yet it contains meditation, concentration, wisdom teaching.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:48.100
 So therefore, it is a beautiful abundance of the goodness of the basket, the field in a basket

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:49.720
 named as Vinayas.

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:57.630
 Vinaya means discipline. Discipline of our body, discipline of our verbal communication of speech,

00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:59.720
 discipline of our mind.

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:08.320
 In the context of the nature, nature, discipline, back to nature, we are out of range of the nature

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.720
. So come back to nature.

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:20.570
 Gentle, peaceful, humble, simple, yet very thoughtful. That's beauty, that's peaceful. Something

00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:23.720
 soothing, something is rewarding.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:31.380
 Even when you do that, if you are able to do that, when you reflect back to that what you did,

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:34.720
 truly it is rewarding and beautiful.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:40.720
 That is what Vinaya teaches. And such as Suttara teaching.

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:50.580
 According to Suttara's principle of teaching on concentration, meditation, but yet it contains also

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:54.720
 morality teaching, it contains the wisdom teaching.

00:10:54.720 --> 00:11:02.720
 It's the combination of all those beautiful 3 and related many beautiful other natures of beauty.

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:10.210
 And then Abhidhamma is the same thing. So therefore, it's called basket. It's just full of a

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:17.720
 beautiful basket that is filled with the goodness of the true nature of our own richness.

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:25.440
 So that we can revert one up another. We can unfold this beautiful, glorious nature of peace and

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:26.720
 harmonious.

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:35.590
 Ublifting, rewarding. To me, rewarding to the others, or to us, to the others. That's what really

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:36.720
 the beautiful basket is.

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:45.460
 So all these teachings, now here, great master, his own union, every land to practice, every land

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:52.720
 to take the word, the full advantage of this life that which is difficult to obtain.

00:11:52.720 --> 00:12:01.770
 Life that is difficult to obtain is referring to our own disparate lives. Our life is difficult to

00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:02.720
 obtain.

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:09.350
 Often, this generally, again when practicing dharma, dharma in the Buddha's teaching, there is

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:14.720
 generally 300 attitudes, 300 different attitudes.

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:26.720
 And those 3 attitudes are known as, every attitude of the old practitioners, every attitude.

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:39.920
 Then attitude of the sarvaka and party buddhas attitude. And then bodhisattva attitude. Those are

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:43.720
 known as the average attitude.

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:52.720
 And then sarvaka and the party buddha attitude, party buddha, or bodhisattva attitude.

00:12:52.720 --> 00:13:01.630
 The average attitude of that practice in dharma, many people think, just average goals in this

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:02.720
 lifetime.

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:10.700
 Some really comfort, good things, beautiful, kind of recollections, recognitions, and as well as a

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:18.170
 little bit kind of good result, benefit, and good status, and for both practices in dharma, I will

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:19.720
 get those things.

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:28.290
 I like to practice kind of, just as merely thinking of these lives, kind of better status, better

00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:29.720
 recognitions.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:37.800
 Even those who believe in the next lifetime, they also think that I practice these, that will give

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:40.720
 me better rebirth in the next lifetime.

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:47.460
 Or in higher realms, such as female realms, or the god's realms, so forth, kind of thinking of that

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:47.720
.

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:54.780
 That kind of attitude in practicing dharma is known as attitude of the average practitioners, the

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:55.720
 average.

00:13:55.720 --> 00:14:03.420
 Then the party buddha and as well as sarvakas, that attitude is of course, the samsara has so many

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:06.720
 difficulties, so many troubles.

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:11.050
 One after another, I don't really like to put this whole challenge to the difficulty of one after

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:11.720
 another.

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:18.720
 I like to read ultimate state of peaceful, and ultimately free from this samsara state.

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:24.400
 Therefore, I'm going to practice and meditate and follow the according instructions, those are

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:30.720
 known as the attitudes of the sarvaka and as well as the party buddha, the attitudes.

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:35.720
 Then there is another attitude, the third one, bodhisattva attitude.

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:41.720
 Bodhisattva attitude is known as the supreme attitude, according to the teaching.

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:48.720
 It is the biggest attitude, not just thinking only themselves or them, but thinking others,

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:51.720
 therefore others are the front than themselves.

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:58.020
 Thinking about all living beings, how many days have they been going difficult, challenged,

00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:01.720
 troubles, one after another in life, it's just so much.

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:04.720
 Therefore, I really like to benefit and help.

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:09.720
 For that reason, I would like to get enlightenment and for that reason I'm practicing.

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:17.320
 And develop the bodhisattva and following the six-part-a-mother or the ten-part-a-mother practices,

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:17.720
 like the realizations.

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:21.720
 And those are known as bodhisattva's motivations.

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:28.720
 Those are generally average, but now in the practicing lineage, in what the university can say,

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:36.720
 then you reflect poor renunciation thoughts, poor renunciation thoughts.

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:42.720
 Those are firstly known as the instructions on the precious lives, instructions.

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:47.720
 Second is the instructions on the impoverished.

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:54.720
 Third is the instructions of the cause and effect as I inevitably.

00:15:54.720 --> 00:16:04.720
 And fourth is the instructions on the samsara has large challenges, large difficulties.

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:13.720
 Those are the four different points, teachings, which is also known as these four teachings.

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:20.790
 Exiled four teachings is the essence of the false true noble truth that what the great teacher Bod

00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:23.720
hisattva came and gave first to know.

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:28.720
 When Bodhisattva came and reached enlightenment at 35,

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:36.720
 after seven weeks he gave the first teaching known as false noble truth teachings.

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:44.720
 This false noble truth teaching, of course, you all know, again, as I said, I'm reminding all of us

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:46.720
 as much as I can.

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:50.720
 False noble truth teaching is suffering truth.

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:53.720
 Second is the cause of suffering truth.

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:58.720
 Third is the part truth. And fourth is the sacred truth.

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:07.720
 This false true truth, suffering truth, cause of suffering truth, that is true truth,

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:16.720
 is the essence of this false point of the training of the mind of poor renour as a source.

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:24.720
 Precious life, impermanent again, and cause and effect are inevitable.

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:31.720
 And the samsara has a dire difficult challenges.

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:37.720
 So this, and now with this understanding, now what we call here.

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:44.720
 Here we said here, here the great master is on the vision which he said in the teaching.

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:56.720
 First is the human body, our life, here it does not as life, but it is our human body.

00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:06.720
 Our human body, our life is again so precious, so many ways.

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:13.720
 First everything of this life, what is the teaching of the friend said?

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:21.720
 Life is, if we use life, this is our own precious life, it is the vehicle to enlightenment.

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:29.720
 It is vehicle. It is vehicle according to your practices.

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:37.720
 Practicing of the Theravada, Omahayana or the Vayayana, according to that level,

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:47.720
 this body, if we use right way, is a vehicle that leads to the show.

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:55.720
 And if we didn't use this life, precious life, exactly as it should be,

00:18:55.720 --> 00:19:04.720
 then it is vehicle to the unending, difficult, unending,

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:09.720
 un-infinite source of the difficulties.

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:20.720
 How many times he said it is the anchor, anchor, anchor of the samsara.

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:27.720
 So this will be, it will lead and keep us in the samsara.

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:34.720
 In the samsara, not just regular samsara, it could keep us in the lower ranks.

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:41.720
 So therefore, this body is, if we use right way or if we use the wrong way,

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:49.720
 that will determine our future destination according to all the teachings.

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:55.720
 It is so precious, so important. It is crucial, important.

00:19:55.720 --> 00:20:00.720
 If we use the right way or if we use the wrong way, wrong way.

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:05.720
 Who will do that? Who will decide the right, use the right way, wrong way?

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:12.720
 No one is outside going to decide that, except one's own samsara.

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:19.720
 We have 100% one authority to our own situation.

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:26.720
 Particularly when we have such as 18 endowments, among that add freedoms.

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:32.720
 And you all know that our baby listed those things tomorrow to add freedoms.

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:36.720
 We have all add freedoms. When you have the add freedoms,

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:42.720
 we have the perfect choice, perfect authority.

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:48.720
 Whatever we like to use is our lives.

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:53.720
 For the good reason, for the wrong reasons.

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:58.720
 Even our intention may be like to be good reason,

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:03.720
 but our activity, if we don't do the right way with mindfulness,

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:07.720
 then it could turn into the sour,

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:12.720
 completely opposite way you want, where it's becoming.

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:22.720
 This is as I said, it's nobody's authority or in control, except our own samsara.

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:28.720
 Particularly, such as all the practitioners, we have every freedoms.

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:35.720
 Regularly, in many parts of this country, or this world, there are so many beautiful freedoms.

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:38.720
 Freedoms, every year, those are right ways.

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:42.720
 Definitely, we have the perfect opportunity to gain them.

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:46.720
 So, therefore, here, great master, he's on the university,

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:50.720
 change the activity of these lives, spiritual lives.

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:57.720
 Life is your usage, or your sight.

00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:00.720
 Whatever you like to do, you can do now.

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:05.720
 Everything is in your control, in your outreach,

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:07.720
 each beautiful status.

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:12.720
 Therefore, please don't be slow down.

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:19.720
 For that reason, great master Chandy Deva said, guide in the way of life.

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:26.720
 And use the boat, boat, B-O-A-T, boat, of these swimming lives.

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:30.720
 Close the shore of the samsaras.

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:35.720
 This is the right time to do. Don't pull out.

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:42.720
 It's difficult to open such beautiful opportunities in the future, where you have them.

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:48.720
 That's the principle meaning of what I said by Chandy Deva.

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:53.720
 So, therefore, this spiritual life is so important.

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:55.720
 Life is so beautiful.

00:22:55.720 --> 00:23:01.720
 Therefore, with great joy and appreciation, respect, respect,

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:04.720
 and use this some degree of purposes.

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:09.720
 Purposes, that to benefit you to oneself, to the others.

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:13.720
 Others. And that is what the great Buddha said in the teacher often.

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:16.720
 Preferring the dual purpose.

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:19.720
 Preferring the one's own purpose of good things.

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:22.720
 Preferring the good purpose of others.

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:28.720
 Then we're fulfilling the good, fulfilling the two purposes.

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:31.720
 Following the footsteps of the Buddha.

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:35.720
 For following the Buddha Shakyamuni, for following his own purpose,

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:38.720
 in a way, he becomes total enlightenment.

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:43.720
 Preferring all obstacles, negatives, difficulties, troubles,

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:47.720
 and fulfilling the benefit of all the beings to different emanations,

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:53.720
 sakayas in the teachings, all that spread, and still the teaching of the Buddha.

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:56.720
 Where would it exist? And we're applying.

00:23:56.720 --> 00:24:00.720
 This is his message, Buddha's teachings.

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:02.720
 And Buddha Shakyamuni himself said,

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:06.720
 "Even my procedure is not existing in the end of the Dijai Dijai times,

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:11.720
 but if there's teaching around the domain, that is me."

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:15.720
 It's me. I'm with you, that. That is me.

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:19.720
 So this means that we apply the teaching to right, to our heart and mind,

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:22.720
 as the Buddha taught, which is good for us.

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:25.720
 It's not just because we are following Buddhism,

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:27.720
 Buddha teaching that I like to follow.

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:30.720
 It's not because it's so good.

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:35.720
 It's good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the ending.

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:40.720
 It is teaching us love, kindness, compassion, respect,

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:45.720
 behave to every living being, stay harmon, peaceful,

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:50.720
 explore the goodness, beauty of ours and others.

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:54.720
 Help to that. Inspire that in that status.

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:59.720
 Don't let the same near beautiful nature in a kind of unknown status.

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:05.720
 Reveal that goodness. Call it this. Activate that call it this.

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:11.720
 That is known as the potable of the Buddha, potable of Munguripayi Masam.

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:17.720
 Truly we will win in the samsara, winner of the samsara.

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:22.720
 Be as simple, humble, don't to the earth,

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:25.720
 but yet for falling so nice and beautiful.

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:29.720
 Something is a harmony blended, not just a kind of bouncing back and forth

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:35.720
 in a clutch of things, harmony mingling, beautiful.

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:38.720
 That is really the message, the teaching of the Buddha.

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:44.720
 So if we do that, that will then make the meaning of this,

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:48.720
 and with this thought, and then we will follow these teachings.

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:54.720
 Again, I'm going to go slowly to this teaching as I said yesterday,

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:57.720
 because many of you already know these teachings,

00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:01.720
 so if I kind of go through this path and then go into something next month,

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:06.720
 going again, this and that is just, I don't, I thought maybe it's not necessary,

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:13.720
 and principally we need to reach together, together and meditating, practicing,

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:18.720
 and doing the healing practice for this timeless, the right situation

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:21.720
 to kind of curl that or demolish the spirit.

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:24.720
 Really we build a heart, build a thought.

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:30.720
 Practicing, and that is known as the practicing, practice of the bodhicitta

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:36.720
 and following footsteps of the old, great masters, our best capabilities,

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:39.720
 which is wonderful, which is beautiful, that I believe.

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:42.720
 And so that's my brief talk.

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:46.720
 For today, thank you very much everyone for participating and listening

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:52.720
 and trying to understand what I will say to you with my accent.

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:59.720
 So hopefully you're understanding 70%, 80%, 70%, some degree,

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:04.720
 or maybe some degree, maybe those who are familiar with my language,

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:08.720
 maybe understanding 89% and then 9%.

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:13.720
 And they have no answer, so I'm sorry, because now we just cured.

00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:18.720
 So get there again in about 20 minutes. Thank you everyone.
