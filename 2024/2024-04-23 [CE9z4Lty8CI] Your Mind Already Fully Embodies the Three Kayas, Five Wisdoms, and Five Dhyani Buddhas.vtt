00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 This natural status, when you got this realization or when you discover that status, there's no

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:12.860
 difference between realization of the Buddha Samyant Bhaddara and your self. It's the same

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.680
 name, single natural state, single natural status. And how wonderful, how amazing, that

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:24.600
 is again here, the great Master Chaka Chororo said, and as well as his Holiness Bhajan Bhajan

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:34.360
 also in the teaching said, the moment, how amazing, how fortunate we can instantly, instantly

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:45.840
 to grab or discover the original Dharmakaya status free from any negativities or defilements.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:53.920
 How amazing, how fortunate we can grab, grabbing or beholding that realization and how important.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:06.140
 And then so that that is what it really is. And then how this is salt-borne, salt-borne

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:13.880
 original Buddha that which is inherited right now, right, right with us. And we behold that

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:21.080
 how wonderful, how beautiful it is. And then this is all the colors of the every, I mean

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:28.160
 all the five guys and the five wisdom, everything is completed within this single status. And

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:36.440
 here, great Master Chaka Chororo explained this nature is. Now I just follow again this

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:43.000
 one, this one with exactly as this. And here he said, all fortunate noble son and noble

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.360
 daughter, listen, this right, this fresh monk, right, this present our awareness, fresh neck,

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:59.720
 the nature is, nature of the three guys. It has five guys. It has five, five wisdom. Everything

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:06.400
 is all the colors of the Buddha in the Sambo Gaya is completed within this status. And

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:12.880
 when you look to this nature of the mind or to this nature, there's nothing you see, nothing

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:21.080
 you can hold. Nature is emptiness. That aspect is Dharma Gaya Sambo. And this, that emptiness

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:27.960
 is not just negation, negation state is brilliant, all the food, the qualities of all the clarity

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:34.720
 qualities. And that is Sambo Gaya status, Sambo Gaya status. And there's also a union

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:45.800
 of this emptiness and clarity is then has the energy of the unceasing. There's no interruptions,

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:53.400
 continually arising energy. And that is the Narmakayas. Narmakayas, it is like, Dharma

00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:01.920
 Gaya quality is like crystal, unimpeded qualities. And Sambo Gaya call it of the net, Rupa is

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:09.520
 clay and illuminous cities. And then that crystal, that union of the crisp emptiness

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:17.680
 and the clarity status has called it of the unceasing displays of the old displays, displays

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:26.940
 of the rainbow lights. And that is like Narmakayas. Those are the ordinary of these three Gayas.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:39.900
 And this is also has all the five

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:47.400
 and this is five Gayas. No, five Dayan Buddha. Sorry, five Dayan Buddha. I mean, it's the

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:54.280
 same five Gaya, five Dayan Buddha. Five Dayan Buddha, of course is the Buddha Verojana.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.480
 And Verojana in the Sanskrit word, in the Tibetan is called the number of namji. Number

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:08.320
 of namji, if we translate it, the Buddha of the display, if we say that, and the second

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:16.800
 is Buddha Renasambhava. That's a Sanskrit word. In the English, if we translate it, the Buddha

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:24.400
 of the richness, all the treasures or source of treasures, that is the Rincim, Nyondi or

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:37.360
 Renasambhava. And then the third one is Buddha Amitavas. That sounds good, but if we translate

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:48.760
 that into English, it is called the Immeasurable light, Immeasurable light, light or Immeagurable

00:04:48.760 --> 00:05:01.640
 yeah, light. And then next one is Amogasadam. Amogasada means all the performance, all achievements

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.640
.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:09.080
 And the next one is the Buddha, then, Akshabhya, in the Tibetan, called Mokkyu Dorjim, means

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:20.160
 uncheckable, indestructible Dorjim, all various sattva, means courageous ones, indestructible

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.840
 courageous ones. So those are the name of the various sattva. That's the major sattva

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:33.840
 for translations. So now we're kind of trying to apply that. So now first I said here, here,

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:44.240
 and I mixed up a little bit, but first one is I said, Buddha Verojana. Verojana is what?

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:54.360
 Verojana means displaying, appearance. So this mind is very, it's always active, appearing,

00:05:54.360 --> 00:06:03.920
 always mind, we can mind, the variety display of the mind comes. It's not just the one mind,

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:10.360
 it's so many different mind, so many emotions, so many thoughts, so many conceptions, and good

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:19.520
 and bad, all that comes, comes. That is the display of the Buddha Verojana, Verojana. And then next

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:19.720
 one,

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:26.880
 I think maybe I'll go with you exactly order this way. Next one is the Buddha Verojana Sattva or

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:27.160
 the

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:37.360
 Akkubya, Akkubya, and that means, Akkubya means indestructible, uncheckable, shakeable, uncheckable

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:47.400
 Verojana, Verojana, and that means the mind is cannot be destroyed. That aspect cannot destroy

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:57.490
 its mind. That aspect is the Buddha Akkubya. And then the next one is Buddha Renasambhava. Renasamb

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:57.760
hava

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:06.530
 means mind is the source of everything, everything what you wish, it really comes. Of course, it

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:06.760
 comes

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:13.400
 on the mind, but then when you activate it, it continues to bring all three, everything, it kind

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:18.810
 of brings everything, whether it's samsara, whether it's nirvana, whatever, it brings all the souls

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:19.440
. So

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:31.640
 that aspect is, is Buddha Renasambhava. And then mind is, next one is mind, it has no, no, no

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:32.400
 limitations.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:43.270
 This place is continually pervasive and continually is, is what's called pervasive in appearance,

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:43.280
 but

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:49.340
 it's just that there's nothing that mind can stop the appearance of the mind or the arising energy

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:49.560
 of

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:58.680
 the mind appearance. And therefore, it is called Amitabha, the infinite light, infinite disbelief,

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:08.440
 disbelief. Then mind is, is from the mind, every, our achievement arises. Everything comes from the

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:15.520
 mind. And for that reason, because of the mind, we can fulfill all the different goals and goals

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:15.920
 and

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:23.960
 aims. And therefore it is called, then called amogasithas. So that way, that way, the five

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:36.120
 Dayana Buddhas also not different from, from our mind. It's all within the mind, this mind. And now

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:51.280
 these five Vasudans also within our mind, mind too. And first is, is, is natural, nature of the

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:51.520
 mind,

00:08:51.520 --> 00:09:01.960
 mind or the mind is completely open, emptiness, and there is anything that we cannot pinpoint,

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:08.720
 or we can indicate anything is really beyond everything. That aspect is a Dhamma Dhatva systems,

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:17.040
 or great like, like spaces, is mind is like space, there is nothing we can divide it, we can make

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:25.640
 anything. That is Dhamma Dhatva systems. And then the second wisdom is a mirror like wisdom. And

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:37.240
 everything, whatever comes, or whatever we see, all is reflecting to the mind, to our own mind,

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:49.360
 everything, what's that means all the senses, all the object of the senses, the seeing, hearing,

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:58.840
 and the smelling, and the tasting, touching, and as well as the concerning thought, all that

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:08.200
 appears within the mind, mind to the mind. So that aspect, mind is like, is, is the mirror like

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:17.920
 what's the, is the mirror. Even though everything appears on the mind, every, all those five object

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:24.680
 was senses or five senses, whatever, all the appearance, there is nothing in the different

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:32.960
 categories of the mind. All are merged in the one status, one single status. And that way,

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:41.720
 in that aspect, is equanimity of systems. All is equal. There's no different partations, anything.

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:49.240
 That is equanimity of systems, equanimity of systems. When arising those all qualities,

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:56.880
 all qualities, that means again, all the five senses, the five objects, whatever arises. When

00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:04.240
 it arises, it's not something that is completely bloated, completely mixed up. In the mind, when

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:10.440
 you see everything is so precise that clearly, and when you see the white, you see is a white. When

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:17.360
 it is red, it is, you see red. When you see it is multiple colors, multiple colors, you see the

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:27.800
 multiple colors, distinctly clearly perceiving exactly as it is. And that aspect is discrimination

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:34.400
 awareness of wisdom. So that means when you hear things, when you see things, when you smell, when

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:42.120
 you taste, when you touch, everything is so precise, so clearly you detected exactly as it is. That

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:52.520
 aspect is the discrimination of wisdom, discrimination. And then because of the mind, as I said

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:53.480
 early too,

00:11:53.480 --> 00:12:02.280
 then it is, we all complicate every performance, every activities, every activities we first we

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:09.880
 initiated in the mind and then activate it and then we perform. And that is then the all

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:19.970
 accomplished here of wisdom. So five wisdom within this status, within this mind, mind is, in

00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:20.360
 nature

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:26.920
 of the mind is the embodiment of the five wisdom. And then sense of mind is embodiment of five

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:35.920
 wisdom and the five chaos also there. As I said earlier too, five chaos within the mind or mind is

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:46.120
 embodiment of five chaos. Dhammada, that we often in the teaching heard. Dhammada wisdom is buddha

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:55.480
 vera kyanas. Dhammada wisdom. And then meralay wisdom is the buddha vajya sattva or the achobhyas.

00:12:55.480 --> 00:13:09.640
 And all economic wisdom is Dharana sambhavas. And then discrimination awareness wisdom is the budd

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:09.840
ha

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:21.080
 amitavas. All a complicated wisdom is, is the amoka sattva. So that means those wisdoms,

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:28.400
 when they are actively arising as the display of the poem, then they appear or those different

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:36.760
 buddhas. This each buddha wisdom is, is like five person wisdom. Dhammada wisdom is like

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:44.840
 veda vera kyana. That didn t mean they don t have other wisdoms. Each of those wisdoms has all the

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:51.960
 five wisdoms too. That s what s called each of the five, each the dhyana buddha are surrounded

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:58.280
 by with different five dhyana buddhas. Display, that s what in the teaching often said, say,

00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:06.620
 said 100 buddhas, all those buddhas. And even they said 100,000 buddhas. It s display of the wisd

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:06.840
oms

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:16.040
 arise in the form of the, of the poems and the enlightenment beings. And the wisdom, when we talk

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:24.040
 talking of wisdom, wisdom is not just a wisdom. Wisdom is a completely saturated combined with

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:30.840
 the compassion and allowing kind of thoughts for all the beings, infinite love and the compassion.

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:37.160
 Now we bring down all the, whether it s the five kya, whether it s the five wisdoms, whether it s

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:37.320
 the

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:47.160
 five dhyana buddhas, where is that all? It s all within our nature of the mind, or nature, our

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:53.800
 nature of the mind. Where that is residing right now, according to Dokki teaching or in the

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:53.800
 teaching

00:14:53.800 --> 00:15:01.400
 offering said, in our heart center. That is all residing in our heart center. Our nature of the

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:08.280
 mind, our mind, nature of the mind, embodiment of the five dhyana buddhas, or all the enlightenment

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:08.280
.

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:15.320
 All is all in the buddha, buddhas summon the buddha. And therefore, teaching mentioned,

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:23.080
 don t look to buddha anywhere else. Your nature of the mind is the buddha. Don t search to anywhere

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:23.080
.

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:29.480
 Every searching and trying to looking buddha, like to find somewhere, you will never going to find

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:36.680
 anything except your own mind. That doesn t mean there is no buddha Amitabha. There is no other

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:44.200
 buddha. They are according to the individual rich enlightenment. Buddha Shakyamuni also become the

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:51.710
 buddha. Because the buddha walk for three countless years, rich enlightenment. There is many budd

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:51.960
has,

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:58.440
 every different directions. But if you are trying to look to find to yourself, like Gint, Gint,

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:07.160
 Gint Buddha, we have to search buddha from the within. Look buddha within, buddha is right here,

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:14.360
 that. And that is to start with that. Then first, we start with meditation.

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:22.920
 So to meditation is we discover the ordinary, absolute buddha. Or the buddha summon the buddha

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:31.640
 or the dharma dhatu, wisdoms. Wisdoms. Always we discover that buddha. We discover all the five

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:38.760
 dhyana buddhas. That means we, when we reach enlightenment in the teaching of the open-set,

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:46.440
 teaching of the set, we reach enlightenment, your environment becomes the pure land, pure land of

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:55.080
 that. So that means we become the buddha and all our environment is become the pure land and all

00:16:55.080 --> 00:17:01.960
 our display of the wisdoms become the display of the five dhyana buddha or five wisdoms or five

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:13.000
 kayas. So five kayas, five wisdoms, five dhyana buddha is within us. We are all accepted or

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:21.720
 completed of that qualities within us, that. So therefore here said it, said it. And again here

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:30.120
 said it. Therefore, so everything, yeah, yeah, this, this is the, so that nature to discover that

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:38.200
 we started with from the discovery of the innate nature of our own mind, nature of this great

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:46.600
 emptiness. Why we have to do that now and that is according togat, togat, because we started just

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:53.080
 looking to the other, those different qualities, we created dualities. That duality become the

00:17:53.080 --> 00:18:01.240
 then hindrance for our realization. For that reason, tattoo is so powerful because immediately

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:07.800
 it cut the duality conception, touch to the core of the true nature and be connected to that and

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:14.760
 when we discover that and call it this, then we apply for some toga practice, it becomes really

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:22.920
 very powerful and very effective, effective in that. So now for that reason, here, here again,

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:28.200
 the great master Shabka Taurunya says, so how to discover that? I mean, we already discussed

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:28.600
 earlier,

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:34.920
 earlier too, and you already know that, that many of you already know that. But to discover that

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:43.720
