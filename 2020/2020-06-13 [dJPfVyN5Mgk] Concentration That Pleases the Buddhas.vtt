00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.900
 Thank you very much, everyone, for joining us today. In this area where I am here, you can

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:21.340
 open. So I just say that in the post, with the opening or with what you were saying, find

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:29.200
 your zone. I'm saying, "Good, up there, good, up there, or back in there, up any way." Thank

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:37.600
 you very much, again, for participating, and coming, and together, we are reflecting, and

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:46.140
 going on, again, teaching of the racist teacher, kindly teacher of the Buddha Shakyamuni, as

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:53.500
 told by the Jyadhi Rudju Rumors. And so we are going in on the light of all those great

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:00.700
 masters, according to their church documents. We are, or I'm doing my best capabilities to

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:08.700
 go precisely, thoroughly, clearly according to my capabilities. And so, that's what we

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:16.200
 are really doing. And also, you can also correct yourself and whatever those any mistakes or

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:23.300
 errors may show up in the game. And it's not my intention that there is some mistakes there.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:30.500
 So really, please correct. We all know and look at the end. Now, with those told, again,

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.800
 to summarize kind of all those beginning talks, I'm going to talk again, we activated our

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:45.800
 beautiful motivations. Motivation of the joy and appreciations, and graceful, grateful.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:53.800
 Those are fundamental foundations of the Buddha teaching, really. Sent at all for the foundation.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:02.300
 With that foundation, there was this motivation of the Bodhicata, thinking of all living beings.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:08.800
 We, practicing of the Dharma, according to Mahayana, ought to benefit all the sentient

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:15.800
 beings. And we are doing that. We are doing, wishing Bodhicata in our heart, mind, and

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:22.800
 actualizing Bodhicata, according our capabilities, with determination, with courage, with

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.800
 commitment,

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:31.800
 with continuations, actualizing Bodhicata. But also, same time, this intention thought

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.800
 is not just once in a while, or when we give teachings, or when we practice, as much as

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:47.800
 you can reflect it, bring up that. That is known as practitioners. That is known as Bodhisattvas.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:56.800
 Follow with the footsteps of the Buddhas. That's really important. That will keep our identities.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:04.800
 Bodhicata is free from self-important. Self-important. So it's thinking of all beings.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:13.800
 What is being reflected by physically, verbally? That is the Bodhicata activities.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:20.800
 With that thought, then with the Vayana teaching, always in the teaching said, bring up the

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:27.800
 recommendation of the three Vayana states. Vayana poem, Vayana song, Vayana mind, or three

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:35.800
 Vayana states. The all appearances are, all appearances are the Vayana of the Buddhas,

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:43.800
 poem of the Buddhas. All the song systems are the speech Vayana of the enlightened beings.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:51.800
 Our mind and spirit are the medallas of the wisdom mind of the Buddhas. Bring those three

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:59.800
 medallas, or three kaya, three vayas, or kaya perfect. All those realizations, those are

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:05.800
 also really important, very essential, not just important. We are practicing. For example,

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.800
 when we do the visualization of the practice, that's what we are practicing. Three vayas

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.800
 are actually the practices. Activating that. So therefore, again, to practice is not just

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:24.800
 begin once in a while or lay idle on that, but from now is good. That is what it is.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:33.800
 Bodhicata and joy and appreciation are the drone of enlightenment. That is light. That

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:42.800
 is the glowing luminously light. Love, compassion, joy and appreciation, graceful in our heart

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:51.190
 and mind, we are illuminated. Ourself illuminated. That is the beginning of enlightenment.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.800
 Therefore,

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:57.800
 enlightenment begins right now. When we begin the practice and we have the right, correct

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:06.800
 motivation, we are really switching on our enlightenment mode, our enlightenment switch,

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:13.800
 that button that we're putting on. That is so important. With this code, again, I'm going

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:20.800
 for the most kind of simplified today, and which is three noble vowels, the beginning

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:28.800
 novel, middle novel and concluding novel. These three novels are also not just during

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:35.800
 only the practices or only when we receive the teachings, but also of the code of any

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:41.800
 time, any occasion when you really practice the meditation or even morning. When we wake

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:48.800
 up morning, have those beautiful thoughts and attitudes. Beautiful thoughts, the beginning

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:56.800
 novel, joy and appreciation, bodhicatas, beauty understable realizations. If somehow we didn't

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:03.800
 get beauty understable realizations, immediately three wedged states, all this form as an American

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:11.800
 legs, dream legs, reflection moment in the waters, bubble legs, those are the release

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:20.800
 in teaching. It's true. There's no substation solid existed at all of any these forms. Even

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:29.800
 though it appeared as a solid conquered, yet is massive heal of the particles or in the

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:38.800
 teaching said atoms. They are changing instantly. Our mind is changing. Our eyes are changing.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:45.800
 Even we look into those objects at that moment, it changed already and our mind changed already.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:54.800
 It's all in a way, sparking energy, sparking qualities. These whole things, this is not

00:06:54.800 --> 00:07:01.800
 just a Buddha said the truth, it was proving these modern times too. Those intelligence,

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:11.800
 wise, open minds are proving through the scientific ways that we heard. That's the way things

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:19.800
 are. So in the teaching say, dream legs, magic legs, maraggy legs, reflection moment in the

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:28.800
 water legs and all those, we really feel like those thoughts. It is good knowledge. It is

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:36.800
 known as knowledge object that meets with where things are. It's not false knowledge, wrong

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:44.800
 knowledge or wrong understanding. It's true understanding. It's where things are. So those

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:50.800
 are really important. Those are very touching to the way nature very closely, where things

00:07:50.800 --> 00:08:00.800
 are, of this phenomenal existence. So beginning novels. Beginning novel is what? Again to

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:07.800
 more practical level we put. Again, joy and appreciation. With that full of devotions

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:15.800
 doing lineage prayers, calling on our prayers. Those are the devotions. This is the world

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:24.800
 of joy, world of the confidence, world of trust, worlds of the attunes, the harms, H,

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:35.800
 Y, maybe M, harms, hymns, hymns of the joy, hymns of love, trust, conflict. Saturday dawn,

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:42.800
 not lingering, wondering in the lost mind. Saturday, now you're going to explore the

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:48.800
 beauty or we are going to explore the beauty of the natural way things are. That's what

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:56.800
 known as calling on paths. Paths. With these thoughts and then body that are taught, we

00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:02.800
 think this, that take love to your body the thoughts. And as well as I also said in the

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:09.800
 teaching always said these four renowned thoughts. Four renowned thoughts. Those are the beginnings

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:10.800
.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:16.800
 Beginning practice. Wherever you reflect those thoughts, our practice will keep fresh. Our

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:23.800
 practice will keep more up to date. It's not going to decline. Paying ways. And kind of

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:30.800
 expiring. Many times that happens. Many people, individually, they start with excitement

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:35.800
 and there's so much there and they kind of almost say, "Paying way. Going way, going

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:43.800
 way. And went way. And then down to the bottoms. Went completely down." Why? Joy, appreciation,

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:48.800
 devotion. Four renowned second thought. They didn't reflect enough in the heart and the

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:54.800
 truth. Carried by the force of the dualities in the illusion or the delusion of the world.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:10:02.800
 The busyness. That carried way. Then, practice is inspiring. The devotion is expiring.

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:09.800
 Bodhicata is expiring. And everything become more, kind of, then carried all over, controlled

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:16.800
 by the skeptical, hesitations, doubts. And all those thoughts are coming up now, gaining

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:24.800
 power over our own goodness natures. Therefore, it's all what is the beginning and over the

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:30.800
 so important. It really will keep fresh. Also, it's not going to, because of this, it will

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:36.800
 happen. As I said, up-to-date, more fresh. It's not just become the Dharma practice,

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:40.800
 or the teachings, or the practice becomes. Care, you know, or it's just the same thing.

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:46.800
 It's boring, or it's kind of like dry, gay, I don't see anything. I mean, all those thoughts,

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:54.800
 because we don't have, many times, we are weak of this polynosite thought, joy, appreciation,

00:10:54.800 --> 00:11:01.800
 all these things. Then, it's really boring. Even though it's true, I think it really feels

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:08.800
 true, sounds true, good, but it's just, then it's hidden. There is the "but". World "but"

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:16.800
 comes. What? Then it comes. That means what? We are going, our feeling, our energy, enthusiasm,

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:25.800
 how we started. It is really going on. Watch out. We have every, we like to make a chain,

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:33.800
 like to implement something in these lives. Those are known as obstacles, hinders. It's

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:43.800
 not naive. It's not just a care. It is awaiting our practical goal, the goal of the practices,

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:50.800
 our identity of the spiritual, a dharma. No matter how much teaching you received, how

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:57.800
 much empowerment you received, how many great masters you received or made and received

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:05.800
 the teachings, we are getting short and weak of those. Our dharma practice, our dharma

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:12.800
 in fire is tumbling. It is a really shaky status. That is what we really have to watch

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:18.800
 out. Great teacher, Buddha Chaitanya Muni in Guru Pemma Sambha, other great master always

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:25.800
 said, "Watch out on the path." That's why one in teaching said, "May I don't have

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:34.800
 any obstacles in my path." But, those are the obstacles, hinders. And so therefore,

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:40.800
 this beginning goal is so important. We see the energy of the beginning novel and then

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:48.800
 we practice the middle novel. Middle one, the novel, as I said, as Pranav I put together

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:56.800
 as six paramatas or bodhicata, wishing bodhicata, actualizing bodhicata, and wishing bodhicata.

00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:03.800
 Again, these are not two different individuals and one right and one left or east and west.

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:09.800
 All combined together. With the loving is coming out, that is supposed to be wishing

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:16.800
 and second is actualizing bodhicata. But when they come to the practice, they go side by

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:23.800
 side or inseparable, inseparable. When you do the generation practices, for example,

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:32.800
 from the generation practices, the best are best on the whole formless, best upon those

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:38.800
 tumi practices. Tummi practices, I'm just using it that commonly, but this is the word,

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:50.800
 dagi nyamba, dagi jiva and dawe jingi, equalizing and exchanging, others are more important

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:58.800
 than yourself or ourselves. That port and practicing generosity, practicing moralities,

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:07.800
 practicing of the patience, every six paramatas are best upon this bodhicata.

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:13.800
 Every case of simplified bodhicata in the teachings is compassion, best upon compassion.

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:22.800
 Every six paramatas are strongly standing on the compassion. They are the compassion

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:28.800
 activities for all the living beings. So that is really the moving forward.

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:36.800
 Every kid then moving one after another in the teachings, but also, as I said earlier

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:43.800
 in the teachings said, even the generosity practice has all the six paramatas,

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:52.800
 and morality paramatas has all six paramatas, and patience paramatas has all six paramatas,

00:14:52.800 --> 00:15:03.800
 and joy for effort has all six, and concentration has all six, wisdom has all six.

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:08.800
 It's not something against six different species in the different areas.

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:17.800
 It's all combined. That's how the beauty of the teaching, how practical, how thoughtful,

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:26.800
 how clarity of the practice touches to our best, our own nature, our own goodness qualities.

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:34.800
 Because it's compassion, because it's loving-kindness, because it's wisdom, all that combined.

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:38.800
 That is really what it is. So with this thought, then we practice.

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:43.800
 And with those understanding, and again I'm full, I'm just reminded that.

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:49.800
 And with that thought, then now we go again to the young paramatas.

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:57.800
 Young paramatas divided into three sections, or three. Those are, as I translated yesterday,

00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:08.800
 and many times I say it all this time, and that first is general concentration of young paramatas.

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:21.800
 General, or in the teaching, some things. General usage, or useful meditation at the beginning,

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:29.800
 or the general purpose, is general meditation to everyone, all the beginners.

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:39.900
 In the beginning times he's jealous. So that is known as, I'm translating, general popular med

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:41.800
itations, or concentrations.

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:48.800
 Second is clearly understanding, understanding of the samadhi that which clearly,

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:54.800
 distantly knowing the meanings, knowing the meaning. That is the second samadhi.

00:16:54.800 --> 00:17:03.810
 And the third samadhi is, or samadha or dhyana. Dhyana is then known as the samadhi that pleases

00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:06.800
 the buddhas, or tathanga.

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:13.800
 So those are the three ways. I mentioned yesterday really about the first ones.

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:21.600
 Post global, when we practice the same thing with good postures, whatever you can do with good

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:22.800
 motivations,

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:32.000
 and all those instructions and instructions. Follow the lineage instructions or instructions of

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.800
 practicing lineages as instructed.

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:42.800
 Follow that. With that, then we practice. When you practice that, and keep the concentrations.

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:53.800
 Not distracted. Distraction is obstacles. When we are distracted, our concentration is not good.

00:17:53.800 --> 00:18:00.800
 We are not concentrated. We are not resting our minds. We are distracted.

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:09.800
 So therefore, keep with the joy of effort. With joy, keep continually doing it.

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:18.800
 Concentrating, meditating, again and again. Even in one sitting, our mind goes away.

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:29.780
 This time, we won't like to mind go away or skate it. We like to bring back to the object of that

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:30.800
 focus.

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:38.800
 In the teaching, use the examples. The focal point of the object is the pillar.

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:46.300
 And keeping up the mind with that focus as the mindfulness. Mindfulness is keeping up there, as the

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:46.800
 ropes.

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:52.800
 And always assisting, supporting by the thought force.

00:18:52.800 --> 00:19:00.720
 Or I also say, "Conquension-ness." If you don't understand exactly my pronunciation, I'm also

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:01.800
 saying, "Thoughtful."

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:11.800
 "Thoughtful." How? That means watching regularly, occasionally, how your meditation is going.

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:20.800
 That means what? We watch regularly of the obstacles during the concentrations.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:29.800
 Obstacles are distractions. There is true principle of distractions that make it.

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:39.800
 In Tibet, "Chigma" means darkness in the sinking mind. That is distractions.

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:48.800
 During the meditation, if the mind is dull in the sinking, that is obstacle.

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:58.800
 So what do we have to do? We have to bring up the alertness, brightness aspect of that.

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:06.800
 Bring up that, up to the standard, natural focus.

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:21.800
 And then, second obstacle is the "Gopa." Skated mind, agitated mind, anxiety mind, worry mind.

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:25.800
 Those are known as "Gopa."

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:36.250
 Why we are worrying? Why we are agitated? Why we are scared of mind? Mostly time is going on the

00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:40.800
 object of the five sensorial place objects.

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:45.800
 Five sensorial place objects. Mind is wandering now.

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:50.800
 Now your body is calm and subtle and maybe build postures, all that.

00:20:50.800 --> 00:21:00.800
 But now, mind is really not rested. It is wandering in all the territory of the five place objects.

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:11.800
 Poem, song, smell, taste, touch. And they may be feeling and ideas and consciousness.

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:20.820
 Those can be divided, good and bad and neutral of that. And the mixture of that, those are, whether

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:22.800
 it is very actively strong,

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:29.290
 or whether it is a very kind of subtle, low key movement, or whether it is a mixture, it is all

00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:31.800
 known as the "Unseth."

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:44.710
 Restless mind, or skated mind. Those are obstacles. Who is going to watch? This mindfulness, alert

00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:45.800
ness,

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:52.080
 appreciationness. These three are in the Divine Teachings or in the Buddha Teachings, "Timba," "Sh

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:55.800
ivi," "Bhayu." Those are the three.

00:21:55.800 --> 00:22:03.800
 This we are going to help and assist, bring back to the focus. Do that again and again.

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:14.340
 How? We did joy. We did joy and we did continuing, to keep up that. That is known as the "Med

00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:15.800
itation."

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:20.800
 Meditating, now you are meditating of the beginning. That is general beginnings.

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:27.800
 During that time, then, which is a little bit more kind of stabilized, and then the feelings,

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:29.800
 experience will come.

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:35.800
 Those are the unity, always in the teaching method. Those are three experiences.

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:46.800
 Blessfulness experience, clarity experience, and no thought experience. Those will come up.

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:57.050
 Blessfulness experience is first called alien energy, because those people who like meditation and

00:22:57.050 --> 00:22:58.800
 spiritual, they like to meditate.

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:06.580
 Why? Because they have blessed calmness, peaceful, soothing, calming. That is the beginning of the

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:07.800
 blessfulness.

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:18.400
 Calmness, it breaks. It has that God. And this nature of the mind is generally calm, clear, and

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:19.800
 open.

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:28.800
 That energy in a way is coming. Now, at the beginning of the time, calmness.

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:35.880
 Calmness, there, in the teaching, says, "Blessfulness." Those blessfulness are very sometimes

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:37.800
 strong and powerful.

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:41.800
 Powerful, where you can't believe excitement.

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:48.800
 And then, the clarity is, and all the blood consumption, excitement, means "I went away."

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:55.950
 Can't believe, "Oh, now gone." And more kind of building in the clear state of the meditation is

00:23:55.950 --> 00:23:57.800
 dawning or coming.

00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:05.150
 Those are clarity. And then, in the teaching, it says, being many Muslims, knowledge is also kind,

00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:05.800
 too.

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:10.800
 And those are the teachings mentioned. And many of those great Muslims say, "Ah, goodness."

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:14.800
 Then, no thoughts. Those are all.

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:20.670
 And really, those people who have that state, just to continue meditating, with those kind of

00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:26.800
 feeling, with those, yeah, feelings and experiences,

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:32.800
 that is known, as in the teaching, say, the first state of the meditation.

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:39.800
 This is also known as "Chamatha Meditation," the heart of the Chamatha Meditation, this time.

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:43.800
 This Chamatha Meditation is also not just only the Buddhism.

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:50.800
 According to the teaching, it is also known Buddhism has history. That status. They do that.

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:54.800
 So, that is the very foundation, "Chamatha."

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:58.800
 And "Chamatha" was made in the Sanskrit epitaph, related in the English.

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:08.800
 I think, calm abiding, calmly abiding, in a debate, "Shine, shivar, neva, shishivar, neva."

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:17.800
 The body reminds calmly, peaceful. That is the basic foundation of the meditations.

00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:21.800
 Above that, now the two more, that.

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:27.800
 Which is, that comes more, like, connected more with the Vibhishanas.

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:34.820
 Vibhishanas, or more, can be done more, is extraordinary meditations of the Buddhism and the Vibh

00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:35.800
ishana.

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:45.170
 So, what means now, this second name, clearly translated, clearly knowing the meaning of where

00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:47.800
 things are, or the pranamana.

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:49.800
 What that means, actually.

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:55.800
 So, in these stages, those practices, exams, of course, in the beginning come too.

00:25:55.800 --> 00:26:05.000
 We find, exam, and see, that really the whole pranamana exists as emptiness. Both subject and

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:05.800
 object.

00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:13.800
 See is emptiness. That's what house you. It's intellectually seeing.

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:18.800
 Intellectually seeing, through the investigation and the latex.

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:32.290
 Let's say, all is empty, status. Yet, it's appearing as magic shows, through the interdependent co-

00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:33.800
ordination systems.

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:43.800
 It's appearing, but there is no solid existing in the core, or in the nature of it.

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:54.950
 It's all the split of the empty. Seeing that, intellectually seeing clearly that, and abiding of

00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:59.800
 the entrance to explore more of this realization,

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:07.070
 continually keeping meditation, continually keeping the concentration, is known as, then, the

00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:09.800
 second stage of this meditation.

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:13.800
 Second stage of this meditation.

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:19.800
 'Bhora, yepa, santi' in a bit. And then, in the English, I translate it.

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:25.800
 Clearly, or distinctly clearly, see the meaning of the pranamana.

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:33.800
 What means meaning? Meaning of the pranamana is empty, or the nature of the pranamana is empty.

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:41.990
 Seeing that, intellectually, continually keeping meditation, with the consumption, with hoping, or

00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:43.800
 with the thought of the brain,

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:47.800
 like to bring more understanding of the realization of emptiness.

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:58.820
 See, it is, now, kind of merging with the vibhachana and the chamala, chamala target, but still

00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:04.800
 with the consumption of the, like to explore more,

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:09.800
 with, in a way, excitement, and joy, and keeping that practice.

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:18.290
 Again, the same way, all these efforts keep, continually keep the efforts, keep the continually

00:28:18.290 --> 00:28:20.800
 applying all the tools

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:25.800
 and the supporters of the techniques, what we listed earlier, a few days ago.

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:31.800
 Oh, ask me. What are the supporters? I listed, there is many teachings,

00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:39.800
 but every summer I get more kind of simple way, five supporters of the meditation.

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:52.800
 Joy, and effort, mindfulness, alertness, no, no, not alertness, sorry,

00:28:52.800 --> 00:29:01.800
 consciousness, consciousness, all thoughtful, and balance.

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:13.800
 These five are the assistants of the meditation, or supporters of the meditation and the practices.

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:20.860
 Then I also listed, last time, and of course you all know, I'm sure you know, that five obstacles

00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:21.800
 of the meditations,

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:33.800
 I also listed, those obstacles are, again, first is, leadingness, second is, forgetfulness,

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:44.800
 and third is, the wild, innocent mind, poor is too much applying the techniques,

00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:56.800
 and pimp is too loose, loose of the techniques, too irregular, or too slow, pleasure.

00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:05.800
 Those are the five obstacles. To bring in the five obstacles that five supports,

00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:17.800
 joy, joy for effort, or joy and joy for effort, mindfulness, consciousness, balance, those are,

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:23.800
 and we keep, continually keep that supports, awarding those obstacles,

00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:32.810
 continually meditating, continually concentrating, with again the same obstacles, beginning, good,

00:30:32.810 --> 00:30:33.800
 middle good,

00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:42.610
 concluding good, and without those frames, continually keeping, then we reach the third stage of

00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:43.800
 the concentrations,

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:47.800
 the concentrations that were released in the Buddha's.

00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:54.030
 That in their teaching, in teaching in that stage, what the realization of those individuals who

00:30:54.030 --> 00:30:54.800
 have them,

00:30:54.800 --> 00:31:05.200
 now they see true nature, exactly as it is, not intellectual, not theoretical, but they behold true

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:05.800
 nature,

00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:15.800
 exactly as it is, as the Buddha sees, as those greater both inside and inside, they begin to see

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:15.800
 that.

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:23.030
 Therefore, it is made as the samadhi, that or meditation, that even the police, the Buddhas or the

00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:23.800
 Atangatas,

00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:31.800
 they reach for deeper something. These five, they see the emptiness of the subject and object.

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:39.800
 I am using subject and object, which also what the popular name is true egolessiness.

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:44.800
 Egolessiness of self, egolessiness of the phenomenon.

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:49.800
 Rely that exactly, really true, as it is seen there.

00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:58.800
 So that is really the third stage of samadhi, and please, and encouraging, also say, for example,

00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:07.300
 beginning of that samadhi, the beginning of samadhi is kind of in the way of every look to the

00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:08.800
 frame of the five parts,

00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:15.820
 five parts of the Buddha's teaching, of when you practice five parts, accumulation part,

00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:18.800
 application part,

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:29.490
 seeing part, and then meditation part, no more starting part, those are the five parts, and of

00:32:29.490 --> 00:32:31.800
 course you all know that.

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:37.660
 Really, when we are trying to connect that, according to the teaching, again, the process of samad

00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:39.800
hi is more corresponding,

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:43.800
 positive, I should say, samadhi, positive concentration.

00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:48.800
 There is more corresponding with accumulation part.

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:54.800
 Second one is more connected to the application part.

00:32:54.800 --> 00:33:00.800
 Third one is more connected then to the seeing part.

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:02.800
 That is how it is.

00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:07.800
 But of course, Mahayana and the Buddhist practitioners, they do practice it.

00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:13.800
 All the both Vibhachana and the samadha are very big in times.

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:17.800
 They are quite targeted, not divided in three different ways.

00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:19.800
 All combined are targeted.

00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:28.190
 What that means, that means, generally what means, samadha means, the abiding aspect of the mind is

00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:28.800
 samadha.

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:33.800
 Seeing nature, the emptiness aspect of nature is Vibhachana.

00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:37.800
 When you practice together, when you practice together with that,

00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:44.800
 stay like that and seeing the nature at the same time as intellectually, theoretically.

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:51.800
 That is the union of the Vibhachana and the samadha in the teaching system.

00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:55.800
 So, that is how really we practice it.

00:33:55.800 --> 00:34:02.800
 So, now that is the breed of the concentration parameters.

00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:04.800
 Concentration parameters.

00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:09.800
 Again, to do the concentration parameters and what we need.

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:16.800
 We need avoiding the distractions, as he said so many times.

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:20.800
 Now I can't avoid what we spoke first time.

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:28.800
 Avoid avoiding the distractions.

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:33.800
 That is why we may go to the hurt.

00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:38.800
 That is why many times, all those great masters, those enlightened beings,

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:43.800
 in the new schools of the Vibhachana and the Kaju schools of the Vibhachana,

00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:48.800
 there were so many great masters on the mountain.

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:53.800
 They had the glaciers, in the caves, in the woods, in the jungles.

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:57.800
 And as well as all, many great was those Indian masters,

00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:01.800
 also in many life stories, and the Indian masters.

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:06.800
 They are all humble, simple, common, chaotic and in the inner places,

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:09.800
 not destructive location, many of those.

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:14.800
 Because why? This is like teachings for us.

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:20.800
 Perhaps in meditation, when we practice, we should avoid distractions.

00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:23.800
 And then precisely more clearly mentioned in the teaching,

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:26.800
 there are two distractions that we have to watch.

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:30.800
 Just physical distractions, mental distractions.

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:35.800
 Once we avoid physical distractions, we go to the hermitage.

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:39.800
 And hermitage qualities are, as the great master,

00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:44.800
 Maitriya Mehen, I went to those, and as well as Kamala Khilapurthog,

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:49.800
 those six different qualities of the hermitage qualities.

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:52.800
 We went through those, one after the others.

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:56.800
 Those are the support of the meditation.

00:35:56.800 --> 00:36:04.800
 Favourable qualities support with our meditation of fulfilment of our practices.

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:09.800
 And even you in that hermitage, and now what?

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:13.800
 We have to be involved in the mental busyness, mental busyness.

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:17.800
 That also Kamala Khilapurthog mentioned clearly, clearly.

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:22.800
 Now trying to avoid the mental busyness, and then what?

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:28.800
 In the teaching said, there is always five obstacles that come,

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:33.800
 five that ditch, ditch we can form.

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:37.800
 And those five ditches will be listed, five obstacles.

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:43.800
 To support those, to avoid that, remove them,

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:48.800
 five of those support are listed today, two, those are.

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:51.800
 Then we continually keep the practices.

00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:57.800
 With joy, and with joyful effort, with courage, with commitment,

00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:02.800
 with both each other, with devotions, we continually keep.

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:06.800
 Every day is fresh, every day is new.

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:09.800
 Every day we renew our both each other.

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:14.800
 Every day we reconnect with the Buddha Dharma Sangha.

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:18.800
 Sangha, every day we strengthen, we strengthen.

00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:22.800
 As every day is a precious day, precious day.

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:28.800
 And every evening we also remain thankful, joyful, our activities,

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:31.800
 our meditators, we really do good.

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:35.800
 Reflect back, to happy, to joy, rejoice,

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:39.800
 same time dedicated that marriage, that virtues,

00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:44.800
 and that for all the sentient beings, for their goodness,

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:48.800
 for to remove the all suffering, the difficulties, troubles,

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:51.800
 and the fulfillment of their enlightenment, final enlightenment.

00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:54.800
 And some bring it to fulfillment with their lives,

00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:58.800
 with their desire, really reaching those things dedicated,

00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:04.800
 and then reaching good thought, with good thought, and go to sleep.

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:09.800
 Sleep, go to bed, with good thought, with good both each others.

00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:12.800
 And in the teaching, many times in the teaching,

00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:14.800
 say that in the practice of the energies,

00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:18.800
 when you go to nighttime, also feel the presence of the Buddha Dharma Sangha

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:23.800
 Dharma Sangha Dharma Sangha, right above your pillows, feel their blessing,

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:25.800
 feel their blessing like this.

00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:30.800
 And feel that we are going to really perform my goal of realization,

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:35.800
 goal of this very human existence in this lifetime,

00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:38.800
 to benefit to all beings, may they bless it.

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:42.800
 And my dream will be become one of the beautiful dream

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:45.800
 that I can practice as dream yogas,

00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:47.800
 every you know, every not.

00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:50.800
 Also in the buddhaic teaching, in the buddhaic teaching,

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:55.800
 say that sleep, go to bed, all this is dreams.

00:38:55.800 --> 00:39:00.800
 All day day activity is like dream, merati, magics.

00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:02.800
 Now is an evening time.

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:05.800
 When you look back to this from the morning,

00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:09.800
 until now it's all, it's like memories, all.

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:14.800
 Not really is this all in the past way now, all is gone.

00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:18.800
 And now what we're seeing is also magic, dream, merati.

00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:21.800
 And myself is like dream, magic, merati.

00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:26.800
 May I have the perfect meaning realization of this magic like realization

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:30.800
 and now I'm going to enter the magic like dream states.

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:34.800
 May I have for the good world this dream also perfectly beautiful

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:38.800
 to actualize the perfect this dream realization,

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:42.800
 to benefit all dream like sentient beings.

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:44.800
 Wishing those good thoughts.

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:48.800
 Then tomorrow I'm going right up again to all good activities.

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:52.800
 Some really have the kind of wishing project of the future.

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:56.800
 Tomorrow activities with determinations and go to bed.

00:39:56.800 --> 00:40:01.800
 Those are all known as practices, in the practice of lineage,

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:03.800
 in the teaching always has started.

00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:06.800
 So those are my thoughts about it.

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:14.800
 Now what you see this way, I concluded, concluded at the end parabola.

00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:15.800
 The end parabola.

00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:18.800
 So we concluded the end parabola here now.

00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:19.800
 That's it.

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:22.800
 So that it went kind of a little bit wide,

00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:25.800
 but today finally we concluded.

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:29.800
 Thank you very much to all your patients.

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:31.800
 Of course, your practice is six parabola

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:33.800
 and I'm trying to six parabola.

00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:35.800
 So we're doing the six parabola practices.

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:39.800
 So, therefore, patient is just very, very beautiful.

00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:40.800
 Thank you, everyone.

00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:41.800
 Thank you.

00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:44.800
 Thank you very much, everyone, again for what is patient

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:51.800
 and you're all joining and listening to my broken thoughts.

00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:52.800
 Thank you.

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:53.800
 Thank you.

00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:59.800
 And then next time I'm going to go over the six parabola.

00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:05.800
 Sixth parabola, which is final parabola.

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:07.800
 So we go there.

00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:08.800
 We go in that.

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:12.800
 We explore that department.

00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:13.800
 Thank you.

00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:14.800
 Thank you, everyone.

00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:15.800
 Thank you.

00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:17.800
 Thank you.

00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:21.800
 We explore that department as much as we can.

00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:25.800
 It's really deep ocean in that, but it is not something that easy.

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:28.800
 But we go at least the baby swimming.

00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:29.800
 Baby swimming.

00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:33.800
 Over the summer they call it dog swimming.

00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:34.800
 Doggy swimming.

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:36.800
 Doggy, please.

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:38.800
 Oh, I do this.

00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:39.800
 I'm not saying you.

00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:40.800
 I do.

00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:41.800
 I will do that.

00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:52.800
 Thank you.

00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:55.800
 Now we do the healing practices.
