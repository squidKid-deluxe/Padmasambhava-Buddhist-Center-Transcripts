00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.410
 A courageous mouse, a fearless mouse, that means, means again, ego is very timid. One way is timid,

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.000
 another way is very skeptical,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.910
 another way is very, very limited, very limited, limited. And therefore, again, bodhichitta is to

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:32.000
 open a door, that love, joy, compassion.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.220
 This open a door to all the beings, that compassion. Why agree with it, of course? Basically we all

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.000
 know, because every living being carries self,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.990
 doesn't matter whatever the size of the body they are, they can be bigger as like a hundred times

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.000
 elephant.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 Or they can be small as three times, probably a hundred times, of the lemurs smallest and central,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 or smallest beings.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.260
 The emotion package is the same in the teaching set. Doesn't matter the body size of that, that all

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.000
 have such dense emotions.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:26.660
 And these emotions relate with them, what, 3,000 or 5,000 or 6,000, those such as ignorance,

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.000
 attachment, anger, jealous,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.090
 headed thought, and pride or arrogance, and doubt, and hesitation, so forth. As long as we have

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:44.000
 that, there is always pain, always suffering,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:53.190
 mentally pain, and physically suffering pain. And therefore, the compassion must go to all the

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.000
 beings as far as space.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.900
 And therefore, it is known as vastness motivation. It's vastness, it has no boundaries, and vast

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.000
ness motivation of the body to each other.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.500
 And with that beautiful compassion, beautiful love, beautiful joy, and appreciation, fearlessness,

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.000
 the open status,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.060
 then if you added additional to the idea in the teaching, the beauty to understand it, then it's

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.000
 beautiful. It's perfect.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:32.950
 It is beautiful cake. We are topping the vegetables. Frost chocolate. Beautiful cake, already it is

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.000
 beautiful, delicious.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 And we add this beauty to understand the nature. We're adding the beautiful frozen chocolate.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 It's beautiful, delicious, from top to bottom. And that, individually, is then in the way we are

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 teaching known as

00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 male vide dara, female vide daras. Male and female vide daras. All yogi and yoginis.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 Yogi and yoginis, male and vide dara, male and female, female. What means vide dara?

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 Vide dara is a Sanskrit terminology, but it means one who holds true awareness, true awareness.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 One is true awareness. True awareness is free from duality, free from the habit pattern.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:37.220
 And, such as Murpema Sambha, Vimalamata, Nijin, Surya, Aumanda Rama, Aulagma, Maajik Laodong, all

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.000
 the 25 disciples,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 those who hold up vide dara. They hold true awareness, not just hold as like we are grasping,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 but maintain with skillful means and Muslim combination with all the innate strangers.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 Maintain that. That is true heroing and heroess, the great bravery, great courageous one,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 who defeated all negative obstacles, the root of suffering, the difficult and the trouble metals.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 Release and revere the true hidden quality of what is inhabited. That is the very own practice.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 For that, to bring that realization, such as this ritual ceremony, ritual object, ritual ceremony,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:36.140
 all is part of that display, part of that to reveal that nature. They are like tools, in a way,

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:37.000
 instrumental

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 to bring this deep of realization of this awareness that we already understand.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:50.690
 Therefore, ritual is good, those who like to perform great with ritual, and that is what Rene Ch

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:51.000
ichi said.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:58.490
 Those who are not really prepared or not like to do, many of those great masters, yoginis who stay

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:59.000
 in caves,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.620
 they don't have any actual rituals to many things. Because, ancient times, to get these ritual

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:05.000
 things,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 such as a bird and a doji and a damaru, you have to make a lot of effort to get that.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.390
 It's not like these days, like a massive town that you can get, because the modern is more

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:19.000
 developed,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 that's what I call the developed. More material, more developed, it's easy to get all these things,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 and people have the capability to get. Ancient times, even they want, it's very difficult to get.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 I think any many places must be, but not to be, because there are no patterns to do these things.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.590
 Things, and you have to do, you have to specifically ask to the smell, all those purpose to make

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.000
 these things.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 So it's really, they're not really making, like commercial purposes,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 they just make individual items for this ask, ask. Therefore, it is quite rare,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 and therefore, many times, those great yogis and yoginis who practice in hermitage,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 they really don't have those, these old ritual arguments.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 But they need big monasteries, definitely, they use this, because they have that,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 and the teaching, imagine those things, it's good to be, to bring forth the power

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 and the realization of the inner God, and bring more beauty, understanding of true nature.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 So therefore, then, there is power which is said.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
 So now again, go back to what I discussed, mentioned,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 is that the post which try to withstand our beautiful motivation,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 motivation of the bodhicitta, the vastness of motivation of bodhicitta,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 and as well as the second motivation, is then purity, understanding, motivation.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 These two are very important. It's not just important only at the beginning of our practice,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 or beginning of the teachings, but that is all, this is actually our practices.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 This is our beginning practices, this is our middle practices,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 this is our head practices, and that is our goal, to reveal this nature.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 Nature, and this nature is the nature of our self, our own being,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 the true nature, Buddha nature, that's what we are going to reveal.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 And with this understanding, then we go more to the post teaching what we've been discussing.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 So, trying to have those, we do our motivation,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 and now we go into detail, go into what we've been discussing.
