00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.640
 Nature and that is what we meditate with. Then to start all this, to start this meditation,

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:12.440
 there is always, in every grade there is practice in realization of beings, the Buddha. Everyone

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:18.920
 says start with the beautiful intention, thoughts, and that we always talk, and you all know.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.840
 This talking is just a reminder, we all remind each other, and that is the principle purpose

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.080
 of the Sangha members, to remind each other, and that is known as bodhicata. Bodhicata,

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:39.480
 in love and kindness could be taught, joy and appreciation. And also see all this dreaming,

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.720
 magic, gathering, triggering, and then practicing, it's like dreaming. It's not also going to

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:52.600
 forever stay forever like this. Well, the dream is here, and you can like, calculate

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.600
 all beautiful dreams, joy and appreciation to each other. The passion, all those beautiful

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:05.320
 qualities we need, with those beautiful intentions we thought, and then meditate. This beautiful

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:12.760
 intention is the ornament of the rupa, ornament of the awareness, ornament of the true nature,

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:20.720
 or ornament of the beauty of the divine of the Buddha. So, when we put love and kindness

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:28.200
 in our heart, we are tracing up, in a way, we are putting our ornaments, we are opening

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:35.480
 our, what's called, closet. Closet, our jewel box, box, and putting up those things. And

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:43.200
 which is beauty of the rupa? Richness, call it, luxuries of the Buddha. And it's un-separable

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.720
 qualities of the richness of the rupa, those things. And with those qualities, and then

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:54.920
 we meditate, practices. And also, we dedicate, which again, once again, bring up this beautiful

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:01.240
 thought, intention, to ours, our family members, to all the beings, really, we sincerely put

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:08.920
 the heart and mind, that is again, power of the, or expressing the power of this divine,

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:15.120
 and also sharing your beauties to the others. Others are wishing the same thing. And that,

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.480
 and we do this, really, that's what all, every, those great masters of the Buddha say. Then

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.760
 we're doing one-foot practices. That's what, that is the exact highway, this, all these

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.920
 ancient great masters, each, through that way, therefore, that's what it is.
