NOTE     "synopsis": "\"Without a beautiful motivation, spiritual growth will not come. Period.\n\nAnd what is that motivation? Joy. It's nothing extraordinary or some kind of strange thing. It's something that we all know. Our basic goodness qualities. But we have to activate those qualities of joy and appreciation, as well as bodhichitta. Of course 'bodhichitta' is Buddhist terminology, but what is bodhichitta really? It's kindness, compassion, and love. And being wise. Again this is nothing strange or some kind of Buddhist dogma. It's the basic goodness of every living being.\n\nIn addition, we get in touch with our purity understanding of the nature. That means we're going beyond duality, and revealing the exact nature of reality as it is, free from the blockage of duality or samsara dogmas. The reality level is pure. Basic goodness is pure. Love, compassion, and wisdom are pure. Joy is pure and devotion is pure.\n\nWe're going to activate those qualities, and not just in some secluded, cornered way. We're going to spread out and break every border and boundary, collapsing all duality and spreading out exactly the way things really are. That is the quality of the Vajrayana teachings.\"\n\nVenerable Khnepo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche teaching on August 28, 2016 at Padma Samye Ling on Shechen Gyaltsap Rinpoche's \"Jewel Staircase,\" a complete philosophical overview of Dzogchen.",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 Thank you very much for everyone coming and participating, and thank you, wherever.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.570
 Again, we are going to reflect the teaching, and we are going to practice this, and therefore rest

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.000
ate the motivation.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.720
 A tension, the motivation, is that instrumental, and a very condition to develop all of our

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.000
 spiritual Adam practices.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 With all the beautiful motivation, the spiritual growth will not come.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.840
 That never comes. That's it. The period. There is nothing, really, any other kind of like questions

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.000
 or anything.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.770
 And what is that? That is a joy. It's nothing kind of extra or nitty or this kind of strange things

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:44.000
.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 Something that we all know, the basic goodness valid, that we have to activate at our colleges.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:59.200
 Joy and apprehensions. Joy and apprehensions. Everybody knows. It's not something that

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.000
 extraordinary things that we are discussing here.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 We are touching to the basic goodness of God and of ourselves. So, joy and apprehensions.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 And then bodhicitta. Of course, bodhicitta has terminology of the Buddhism, Buddha's teaching.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 But what is bodhicitta? It's kindness, compassion, love.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 And wisely, to activate that, what's the knowledge? That is, again, nothing strange.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.840
 Nothing, any different things of Buddhism, Dharma, or anything. It's basic goodness for every

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.000
 living beings.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 That's what the Buddha said. It's true. It's not just the Buddha said. We are believing that.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 They are above that. And then we have going to the purity understanding of the natures.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 Purity. That means we are trying to kind of go beyond of the dualities.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:57.180
 We have to revert the exactly natural quality as it is free from the blockage of the dualities or

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.000
 the samsara dharmas.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 That is known as the purity understanding. The nature reality level is pure.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:14.090
 Basic goodness is pure. Love is pure, compassion is pure, wisdom is pure, joy is pure, devotion is

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.000
 pure.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 We are going to activate that quality. That quality.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.790
 And not just the excluded quality ones. We are going to spread out, break every border, boundaries

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.000
 of the borders.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.350
 Clap their borders and spread out. Exaluate things up. That is the quality of the Vayayana

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.000
 teachings.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 Vayayana means diamonds. Courage like diamonds, compassion like diamonds, wisdom like diamonds,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 and realization like bed diamonds, fearlessness like diamonds to discover our innate true nature.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 Our goodness qualities. That's what is known as diamonds like diamonds.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 So discover that quality. Exactly as it is.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 That is known as the purity understanding. Pure perspectives. Other Vayayan understands.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 And the looking level is known as the dharmakayas.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.210
 We have got many of you already know that there are three dharmakayas. Dharmakaya, sambhokaya, and

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:14.000
 namakayas.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 Also not really any different kind of like different things.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 Hardness means we are bringing new things here.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.200
 Buddha pointed, Buddha summoned, Buddha pointed, Guru Pima Sama pointed out and all those great

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.000
 monks pointed out.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 The three kaya is with us. And that we are going to discuss here in the Dharmakaya teachings.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.230
 Three kayas. That three kaya is not just excluding things in the corner, the narrow corner side of

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.000
 that.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 Three kaya is the pervasive corner for every direction. Every way. That is the realization.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 The narrow corner is duality. That is samsara. That is trouble. That is blockage.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 That's what we can't relate. All struggling with all the time, carrying one up another.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 We are going to break through that. That's the whole purpose of practice and meditation. All this.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 So therefore, wrist length and all this beautiful motivation, beautiful thought.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 That is really the essential key of every fulfillment, every success, successful of our realization

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.000
,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:32.380
 our developments in our goodness and I would like to benefit it to myself, one's own self, to the

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:33.000
 other's base.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.900
 There is nothing, any other alternative than reactivating the good motivation, the goodness

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.000
 motivation.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 So therefore, that is what always in the teachings say and all the great masters say.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:55.500
 One up another and the K.T. body here in his home in the dual

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.260
 always repeated those teachings and not just only them. Everyone said one voice and we should

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:00.000
 release that in that qualities.
