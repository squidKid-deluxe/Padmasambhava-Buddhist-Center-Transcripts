00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.080
 "Quite a few times, many of you know already that. Few of these, if you can't do this, this is the

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:07.720
 first time,

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.080
 even though you heard Dharma teaching so many times, there's nothing kind of a difference in it

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.160
 than that."

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:22.000
 "But this entire teaching is teaching on the nature of the mind, and your nature of the mind, my

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.320
 nature of the mind."

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:30.370
 "This entire teaching, the teaching of the nature of the mind and the Dzogchen teaching is pointing

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:31.560
 out to us,

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:43.060
 your and my nature of mind is already in enlightened status, already in the Thri Gaya status. Thri

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.640
 Gaya is enlightened status."

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:54.640
 "And that is how, how it says. But when you look to your mind, made without going to looking out,

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.800
 now you're still looking outside."

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:10.040
 "You look that mind, look to the looker, looker that. The moment you look to the looker, looker."

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:20.990
 "Karma like, there's nothing really much to do. But this moment you do, when you look to the looker

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.400
, that moment, what we're finding, is known as then openness."

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:36.650
 "There's nothing really we can see. Why it says openness? There's no boundaries, no walls, it's

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.560
 completely vastness, spaciousness."

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:56.600
 "In that nature, it has no name of the stains, stain, S-T-A-I-N, stains or obscurations."

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:06.790
 "Therefore, it's called piyo. This piyo is not just now happened that, from the beginning. It is

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.720
 from the beginning less that is that nature."

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:21.000
 "And therefore called piyo from the beginning. Piyo, that piyo is not just now from the beginning."

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:31.960
 "Piyo from the beginning, stainless. What is not a name of that is samadabhadra, kunthu zanggu."

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:40.700
 "Kunthu zanggu has been translated into English. Always good. All the time good. Not being good

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:46.920
 once in a while, then it's not good. It's always good."

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:56.360
 "That is now what we are beholding. When you look to the looker, that moment you are beholding,

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.120
 that nature."

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:04.300
 "If you like to speak, or if you like to speak, there's something about that. There's nothing to

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.800
 speak. That's called speechless."

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:18.210
 "That's what Buddha said." "Inexpressible." "Inexpressible." Also what Buddha said. "Inconceivable

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.360
."

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:25.410
 "It's something kind of bad beyond the conceptions. There's nothing to be conceptualized, anything

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.720
."

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:34.120
 "How we can understand that is only by our own realizations, our own experiences."

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:41.720
 "What the Grand Master's teaching in the Zoki said. Experiencing the molasses by the nude persons.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.600
 Nude. Nude, right?"

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:52.760
 "Nude persons. When they're experiencing all the flavors of the molasses of candy or the chocolate

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:53.240
."

00:03:53.240 --> 00:04:01.640
 "The nude person. What nude person can say about that? Only can experience."

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:08.600
 "The experience is not just like conception, like power way. It's direct perception experience."

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.080
 "Direct, valid cognition power way perception. That is right there."

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.720
 "And therefore it's called inconceivable, inexperable."

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:27.080
 "This nature is how it is. This nature of the mind is then unbound, unseasoned."

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:35.960
 "Unbound, unseasoned, that's what it is." "This is the nature of our mind and your mind."

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:42.280
 "When you recognize this nature, when you behold this nature."

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.920
 "That's what in the Zoki teaching said, more round and proper."

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:52.120
 "Reconizing right or at all natural states."

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:59.320
 "The famous word of the garab dot is first pass word. Recognizing one's own nature of the mind or

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.920
 more rataum too."

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.600
 "More rataum to interpret means kind of difficult to talk like this things."

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.400
 "But more rataum, you recognize that you by your own side."

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:14.360
 "Not somebody is recognizing that and telling you. I mean, the Buddha said that too."

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.840
 "But it's one's own recognizance."

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:24.440
 "This is something that you really merged. Merged as it is."

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.650
 "When you merge it as it is, what also in the Buddha teaching or the Vajrayana teaching you said

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:30.280
 that."

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.880
 "Jongpeng, the child in the mother's lap."

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.880
 "Love, without any hesitations."

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:43.080
 "And doubt or the karma, we don't have to question a second time, say about this."

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:49.720
 "This is the water it is." "That is the water the nature is."

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.360
 "This is what we are going to meditate."

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.000
 "Meditation is the name."

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:01.400
 "What means according to the Zoki level of meditation is maintaining in that natural status."

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.440
 "Be in that status."

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.840
 "It's the meditation."

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.120
 "And without it, distract it."

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.120
 "Destruct it."

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.120
 "What means destruct it?"

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:20.120
 "If we destruct it, then we are wandering on the walls of the habbi japatas."

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.120
 "We carry out, we're not on the nature."

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:30.120
 "So without a distraction, distract it. Be in that status."

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:36.120
 "When you recognize that nature, when you realize this nature as karma like."

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:42.120
 "You merge it to nature as its own your status, without any doubt and hesitations."

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.120
 "When you see this, I mean there's nothing doubt to hesitate."

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.120
 "This is your nature."

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.120
 "This is not just a pure talking."

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:53.120
 "It is a nugget experience of the worder, water, cognitions."

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.120
 "I said so many times."

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.120
 "This is what it is."

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:04.120
 "When you have that realization, then this is."

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:07.120
 "This nature is."

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:12.120
 "Never, nothing can be changed on this nature."

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:16.120
 "As I said, from the previous time until now."

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.120
 "Or in the teachings said, in the Great Master and Kainji".

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.120
 "But the Khera and the Buddha said so many times."

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.120
 "Nature never changed."

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.120
 "And the Buddha teaching said too."

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:32.120
 "Nothing is going to change by this, by any force, by any means."

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:40.120
 "Whatever it is, it is in that nature's status."

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:44.120
 "Whatever it is, this nature's status."

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:48.120
 "Even there's a turbulence, anything arises and can't be displayed."

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.120
 "Expressions are coming."

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:57.120
 "It is all happening in that nature's status."

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:01.120
 "This is known as, and as is arising."

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:05.120
 "As is arising."

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:11.120
 "And also it is merging or liberating or merging back to that nature's status."

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:18.120
 "That means all the senses, whatever is arising."

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:23.120
 "Is arising from that unimpeded Samadabara nature's status."

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:29.120
 "Or Kunduzampo status, pure Kunduzampo status is arising from that."

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:35.120
 "And performing that show of arising, the display is within that nature's status."

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:44.120
 " Kunduzampo status or pure Kunduzampo status is merging back to that nature's status."

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:52.120
 "Nature's status, there's nothing higher and deeper, more powerful than these realizations."

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.120
 "Or recognize of this."

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:57.120
 "Then that is known as in Garabdorti's Second World."

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:03.120
 "There is no need to be doubt and hesitate."

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:07.120
 "This is perfectly powerful."

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:10.120
 "Feel joy and hobby."

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:14.120
 "We don't have to work with the teaching system."

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:18.120
 "We don't have to be mouth-watering for the other things."

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:22.120
 "Mouth-watering for the Ed Yana's teachings."

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:26.120
 "Zogin is the ninth Yana's or Ed Yana's teaching."

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:29.120
 "We have everything."

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:34.120
 "We don't have to be distracted by the things of the other Ed Yana's."

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:36.120
 "We have the essence."

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:41.120
 "It is, therefore, to burden up the confidence."

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:46.120
 "Burder up the confidence, joy, and appreciation."

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:48.120
 "Enjoy that!"

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:52.120
 "Not skate at court and afford all different directions."

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:55.120
 "And become a jersey of the spirituals."

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:57.120
 "Be in this natural state."

00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:00.120
 "Burder up the realization within that."

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:05.120
 "Follow the legacy and example of such great master."

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:09.120
 "Master of the Moochimas, all the great master of Malarai."

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:12.120
 "All that. Do drop that."

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.120
 "That is the one."

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.120
 "And Buddha, for example."

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.120
 "All this."

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:18.120
 "This is."

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:22.120
 "Once you have that realization, when you do, you will be maintained."

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.120
 "Maintained."

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:24.120
 "Maintained."

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:27.120
 "Then what?"

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:30.120
 "Everything is going to be transcendent."

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:35.120
 "Transcendent. Transcendent liberated, it is in all natural states."

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:36.120
 "It is all."

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:41.120
 "Whatever situation, whatever arises."

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:51.120
 "Arising all that is immediately liberating in that natural or the kundasaka states."

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:54.120
 "Pure from the beginning states."

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:57.120
 "Pure from the beginning states."
