Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche\nPSL One Month Dzogchen Retreat on Chetsun Nyingtik\nPadma Samye Ling Retreat Center\nApril 12 - May 10, 2025\n\nDay 9\nMay 2, 2025\n\nThe first Dzogchen masters left this world in a characteristic way: in a rainbow body of light after giving a final teaching to their disciples. In Tibet, the ones who spread the Nyingtik (heart essence) teaching of Clear Light were the great masters who possessed their special direct transmission, chiefly the great scholar Vimalamitra and Guru Padmasambhava. Vimalamitra passed these instructions to Chetsun Senge Wangchuk, who also attained the rainbow body. The teachings he left were later revealed by the First Khyentse, and are part of the secret category of Dzogchen pith instructions, Mengagde.\n\nThese rare and extraordinarily profound teachings precisely explain various essential methods for directly actualizing the innermost teachings of Ati Dzogpa Chenpo, the Great Perfection, the Peak Vehicle, which is the direct method for swiftly realizing the ultimate nature of the mind and attaining buddhahood in the rainbow light body.\n\nLearn more about this retreat:\nwww.padmasambhava.org/event-details-registration/restricted-silent-one-month-dzogchen-retreat-at-psl-w-ven-khenpo-tsewang-rinpoche-april-12-may-10-2025\n\nLearn more about the Chetsun Nyingtik:\nwww.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Chets%C3%BCn_Nyingtik\n\nwww.padmasambhava.org",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.640
 So now, so that is really about the body. And now we go to the third one. Third one is the

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:15.800
 kind for the purification of the creation. So now this is the purification practices.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:24.520
 And again, this is a powerful practices and is the purification practices and it is purification

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:31.920
 practices, together with it also accumulate the merit, both together. The fourth is purification

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:42.880
 practices. So now what we purify? We purify all our obscurations, negativities, and we

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:49.960
 purify negativities and obscurations also as well as all the living beings too, because

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:57.740
 our body together. Again, to do the body purification in the teaching mentioned, we do the bodhis

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:58.080
attva,

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:06.120
 the relative bodhisattva. Without the relative bodhisattva, the purification, again, practices

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:13.640
 well won't walk exactly as we want it. We have to combine the bodhisattva with this

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:21.080
 relative bodhisattva. And not just only relative bodhisattva, we have to have the devotions,

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:28.800
 confidence, or that means rafuj, being closeness connections to the Bodhidharma Sanghas or the

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:35.680
 Bodhavajasattvas and then bodhisattvas. And generally in the teaching said, when you have

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:43.360
 the bodhisattva, bodhisattva well clear with obscurations. Bodhisattva will purify all

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:49.640
 our heavy karmas, in the karmas too, really in the teaching said. For that reason, great

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:58.240
 master Shanti Deva said, "Moment you develop the bodhisattva in heart and mind, that moment

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:07.200
 you start to purify our negativities, karmas. Moment we will develop the bodhisattva in

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:14.520
 our heart and mind, that moment, the power of the bodhisattva is like fire, that will

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:23.680
 burn the heavy load of the collected karmas, bad karmas. Therefore, bodhisattva itself is

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.920
 so powerful. It really, when we have the bodhisattva, each time we develop the bodhisattva, it

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:30.360
 clears

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:38.560
 with karma and it clear purify the karma. Then what? It accommodates the merit, same

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:45.120
 time, regaining, we reversing. Until we meet the teaching, teaching of the greatest teacher

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:51.000
 of bodhisattva community, we're more accommodating, maybe heavy karmas all the time. By time we

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.040
 met as the teaching, teaching greatest teachers and heard the teaching and we apply that teaching,

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:04.160
 that moment we start really to purify and burning the karmas, heavy karmas, all that.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:11.600
 So we purify that. And now how many days of obscurations? Generally there's minutes that

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.600
 we heard always. So again, I highlight that in the mind to all of us. Those karmas are

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:24.060
 generally named as, I mean, obscurations, how many obscurations? Two obscurations. Those

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:34.560
 are known as the emotion obscurations and the teaching said knowledge obscurations.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:41.360
 So two obscurations. What is this emotion obscurations? Emotions obscurations is a

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:49.000
 great teacher of bodhisattva community, the fourth teaching, cause of suffering truth.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.700
 That is emotion obscurations, cause of suffering truth. Cause of suffering truth, they can

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:07.520
 divide it into two, emotions and karma. And in the teaching they said le nu mung wa. Le

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:16.040
 nu mung wa is the cause of suffering truth. So our cause of suffering, all the beings

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:25.940
 of suffering, cause of suffering truth is karma and emotions. Who caused the karma? By

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:36.520
 the emotions. Emotion is what? It's three principal things, ignorance, attachment, anger. Where

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:48.620
 did that come from? From mind. Mind created negative emotions. How that happened? As like

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:57.000
 dark cloud in the sky. Even though it's not really connected to the mind, mind very created

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:06.440
 that. Such as like cloud in the sky. Cloud is not connected to the sky, but it appeared

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:16.160
 in the sky. The rain cloud, thunder clouds, all that. That appeared. By that happening

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:24.480
 that and then it created the karma, the action. Karma is the Sanskrit word which means action.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:33.960
 That not emotion and not just state like without doing anything. It did activities. Active.

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:43.000
 And among the three emotions, who is the prone runner? Attachment and anger are the prone

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:57.640
 runner. Ignorant is behind the scene. Ignorant is cause of the attachment. Ignorant is cause

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:04.640
 of the anger. What that attachment anger, if it gives another name in the practice of

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:12.380
 repeat instruction, hope and fear. Hope is what we like to hope in. It's attachment we

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:23.960
 like to have. Fear is scared, going to lose, let it be frightening. Fearful. Then we show

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:34.620
 that. The balls are saturated by the ignorance. Then combination is when it acted by the physically

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:48.480
 verbally, it projected to the out. Out, then it created the trouble. It created the trouble.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:54.960
 It made trouble to those projected things. It made trouble to ourselves. Who gets more

00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:00.520
 trouble? According to the greatest teacher of the Buddha, Hakemuni, even we projected

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:07.680
 to the others, others think, "Oh, I've become the winner," or "I did something." We feel

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:16.940
 the winner. But that is tricking to our own mind. Reality, who is the loser? Jewel is

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:28.540
 a loser. One who did is a loser. Then create the karma. Create the karma. According to

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:38.120
 the degree of the activity, then it's called karma, light karma, medium karma, heavy loaded

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:47.600
 karmas. According to the degree of that. Then it's not the karma, it's according to Buddhism.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:53.240
 The Buddha is teaching. It's not just going to happen one time, you did it because one

00:07:53.240 --> 00:08:04.340
 time it multiplies. It multiplies. In a way, we plant the seed on the ground. When we plant

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:12.600
 the seed, we're not expecting to get one result. How many from that seed, one seed we plant,

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:22.780
 how many results or how many crops will come from that? Karma is like that, according to

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:30.660
 the degree of the activity. Karma, we planted where? We planted our subconsciously storehouse.

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:40.200
 We planted that. Now we plant it. And continually, we preserve it with all other ongoing emotions.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:47.440
 Not just let it dry or let it go away. We continually preserving unknowingly, continually

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:54.720
 protecting, continually looking after that in a way. Then it will mature. Whether this

00:08:54.720 --> 00:09:01.880
 lifetime or according to the teaching, maybe after many lifetimes, it will mature. Not just

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:07.720
 then we need to mature, it's not just the only one time. Many times can happen. Again

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:14.920
 and again. That's the way the system of the karma in the teaching said, really goes. Of

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:27.870
 course. So that is known as the karma obscuration, karmic obscurations. Then there is no obsc

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:29.420
uration,

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:38.040
 emotion obscurations. Emotion obscuration is source. Then expanded these three emotions,

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:46.840
 expanded and what are those? Jealous. So the arrogance. And then excitedness, doubt, and

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:52.520
 hesitation. All that target expanded in the gracious teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni said there

00:09:52.520 --> 00:10:02.380
 is 20 sub-emotions. Sub-emotions. We can always count five emotions, six emotions.

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:11.920
 And they all target 20 sub-emotions from the root emotions. All that, those. All these

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:17.760
 emotions. Those if you like to look those things in the Abhidharma teaching, or it is

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:26.480
 translated in the Suno line of Shambhala publication, those are known as knowledge, get the

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:27.120
 knowledge,

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:31.960
 I think by great master Maharaja teaching. So if you like to look those, it's all listed

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:39.800
 there. There. There. All. Yeah. That is all. So those are known as karma obscurations and

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:48.840
 emotion obscurations. And then knowledge obscurations. Knowledge obscuration is attachment. Greedy,

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:58.520
 greedy. Attachment and clinging, sorry. Attachment and clinging. That is deep down. More stronger

00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:07.000
 than the anger and those anger and attachment. It's very deep according to teaching. Teaching

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:14.520
 is really very deep. Clinging is very, very deep. And then clinging to many things. Clinging

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:20.840
 as a poem. Clinging, clinging on the perceptions. Clinging on the conceptions. Clinging, clinging

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:26.800
 on the consciousness. And then all those varieties of the clinging of the me and the clinging

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:32.700
 of the others. Clinging of the mind. Clinging of the others. And so many different clingings

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:39.540
 and ideas. And toward my way of thinking that in my belief, this and my belief that I mean

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:46.120
 all those so many clingings. This is the one approach. Reality is all mind. There's nothing

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:53.160
 externally independent existing outside. We can say, oh, and hide this and that. All creation

00:11:53.160 --> 00:12:00.520
 of the mind is all clinging according to the teaching. Clinging is publication. We're holding

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:07.120
 up. Holding, holding, and then become trained. And then with that, when we hold, not just

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:13.720
 we hold, we're trying to keep up that, that what we believe. I like to do that and make

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:20.140
 all the activities, the karma activities. Or maybe sometimes the good activities and

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:27.920
 bad activities and then create ongoing activities. Those are all known as obscurations. Obsc

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:29.240
urations.

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:37.960
 Obscurations and negativities and defilements. All those names used for that. And now we're

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:44.280
 going to clear with that. Clean with this. And then also according to the Buddha's teaching,

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:53.080
 those are what? There's two obscurations in Buddhism. Those are known as natural obscurations

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:59.720
 on natural negatives, public negatives. I mean, I'm translating like that. And of course

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:07.720
 you can look that. Natural negatives, it is 10 non-virtues that you all know. Three by

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:19.720
 the body, four by the speech, and three by the mind, all together, 10 non-virtues, 10

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:28.680
 negativities. And 10 virtues, opposite of those, 10 virtues. So these those are known

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:35.440
 as natural, natural. Because why is it natural? This is not just something that connected

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:45.960
 with any religions. But every country identify it and recognize those are negatives. Maybe

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:51.240
 there's the last one, three mental state had slightly different that, but otherwise everyone

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:59.800
 really believes those are not good. Everyone. So those are the universally proved negativities.

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:07.080
 And then there's publicating negativities. And who's publicating? That is a gracious

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:14.680
 teacher, Buddha Hekamuni, to preserve the morality, in tragedies and attentiveness of

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:22.000
 the practice of meditation, Buddha Ghee, many guidelines. And those are known as publicated

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.580
 because in a way Buddha publicated. And when you do also do those, those are then known

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:37.480
 as vows. Vows, in Vinaya vow, or rules, the vow, bodhijata vows, Vaidhyana teachings, samayas,

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:43.680
 those are slightly different names, but reality is just basically the similar things. So those

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:48.720
 are all, I don't know, when we are against it, or when we can't really go over that or

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:55.440
 beyond that, then it becomes negativities. Whatever it is, then it will again become

00:14:55.440 --> 00:15:01.360
 obstetricians. So now we're going to purify that, purify it with the proper techniques

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:07.440
 of the Vaidhyana teaching, and particularly Dzokhi teachings. Dzokhi teaching, and that

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:12.680
 is, then is here clearly mentioned, and we go over this.
