00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.700
 Welcome everyone. Thank you. Welcome everyone. Thank you again. We are going to continue with the

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.000
 teachings of the great teacher, Buddha Shatyaman.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.270
 Of course, he is a delegate that came from the Dunyo Lingpa, but it is his Buddha Shatyaman's

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:21.000
 teachings.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:31.150
 The greatest teacher, a variety of the teachings that lead to every single living in life as did in

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:40.050
 the contrast of the joy and appreciation and respect and the non-volence and peaceful way to

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:47.000
 discover the innate nature come out of the difficult challenges, the troubles of the samsara.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.420
 Everyone has that status, so that's what the greatest teachers give, a lot of teachings and all

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.000
 that.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:03.130
 So this time we are following the highest level of the mostly dirty teaching, how to discover our

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.000
 innate nature.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 So that means how to become the Buddha. Instantly, how to become the Buddha.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:19.130
 That's the really the kazokhi teaching, is there and simple, according to it, is easy, is very,

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.000
 very direct.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.190
 It won't take a long time to reach enlightenment or to become the Buddha. Everyone follows the

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.000
 instructions.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 Generally, in the teachings said, the Buddha gives three different levels of teachings.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.960
 Those are, kind of like, to discover or to become the Buddha, long way and short way and very short

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.000
 ways, those three different ways.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:55.200
 Long way is kozayana, kozayana teaching. It takes a long time with the core commitment, the joyful

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.000
 effort, those are all we need.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.230
 No matter what you are practicing, and the bodhicitta, intention, all that, and then the kozayana

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:09.000
 teaching, it will take three coneless eons to become the Buddha.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 So it's a long process, but however, even it's a long process, it's not boring, it's not trying.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 It's a kozayana teaching, really, it is so joyful, so uplifting, advancing, moving forward.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.600
 For that reason, great Master Shanti Deva said, by the mandatory activities, your physical

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.000
 condition, government condition will be perfect, perfect.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.230
 So there is no problem of physical troubles. But practicing of the wisdom, your mind will be so

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.000
 calm, peace and happy.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 So therefore, who will be bold to stay in the samsara? And who will try?

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.480
 Because you are perfectly fine with healthy level, physical level, and mental level, you are

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.000
 perfect, and joyful, and happy.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:04.920
 So why? That's why really, even it's a long time, but it is a very uplifting journey that what the

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:11.000
 teaching is, because it is touching to the inner core of our own true beings.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 And also as well as helping to the others to discover the inner core as natures.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 And then, longer one, then the shorter one is, for example, outer than the teachings.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.180
 Outer than the teachings, according to teaching, it takes the shortest one is three lifetimes, or

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.000
 seven lifetimes, sixteen lifetimes.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.660
 Those are in the teachings said. So it is like, it is long way, so that means, fifteen, seven, and

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.000
 three lifetimes, it takes.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.470
 But this quickest way, zokki teaching, or the inner sattara, particularly zokki teaching, it can

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.000
 reach enlightenment within these single lifetimes.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 And we follow the instruction, and according to the teachings, it really teaches.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.280
 Again, it is a very quick part. Once you reach enlightenment, or once you become the Buddha, this

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.000
 is not just, you can't then completely retire, it's not.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 When you become the Buddha, you're going to benefit, help to all living beings.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:20.500
 Very continuations, continuations, pervasive without any efforts. Effort, or without any heartache

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:26.000
ts, those are the continuations, pervasive without any effort.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.050
 You're going to benefit for all living beings. So this, among those like levels, we are in this

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:40.000
 really very powerful, special teaching, yet it's so simple, and so direct, as with what we said.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.800
 The other day, the great master said, I mean, what we said is not something that we are talking, or

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.000
 I'm talking that.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.490
 I'm just trying to follow the exact instructions of the great lineage masters, and the teachings,

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.000
 as it's mentioned.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:01.210
 So I said, yesterday, I am repeating that, I'm echoing of those great teachings, that once you

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.000
 discover your inner nature,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 discover and identify our own inner nature, that is our own nature, discover.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 Once we discover that inner nature, then maintaining that, that's the meditation.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 Maintaining, keeping up that, with those, again, some instructions, those are unshakable.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:33.570
 Unshakable, physical, body, unshakable senses, unshakable mind, or movable, not moving the physical

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:34.000
.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:41.090
 So that means, whatever posture you are, or we are, trying to stay there, not just moving so many

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:42.000
 times.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 Relax, that means relaxing the body, relaxing the speech, relaxing the senses.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:57.240
 What that means senses, eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, keeping calm, not kind of regulating, trying

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.000
 these and that things,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 and that stay calm and relaxed, that's called unmovable, or movable, e-movable, e-movable.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 And with that, then, no, without any effort, sorry, then liberating.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 Let it come, let it go. What that means?

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 Our thought will not stay, even we stay. Even we are calm and physical, thought will not stay.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 This thought is what? According to Dzokhi teaching, it's expression,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 express of the energy of the Dharma Gaya, energy of the enlightened mind.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 Therefore, let it come, don't block, not trying to stop,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 preventing the power and the energy of the Dharma Gaya is not correct.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 Let me block it. Block it, that means regulating.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:05.000
 Regulating thought is ultimately duality. So, let it come, let it go.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 What that means? Let it go. Let it go means don't hold, not holding.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 By hold who? By our thought. Again, hold means not just hold that thought,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 but try chasing the thought, imaginary thought.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 Kind of all thought comes and we start chasing each of the thoughts, then we are deluded.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 Those are known as reach, reach of the dualities, and we chase thoughts.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 There is endless, there is no ending.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 That thought, chasing thought is samsara.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 Even though we are sitting in beautiful positions, beautiful kind of everything quite good,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 we know that when we start chasing our thoughts, when it comes, and then chase thoughts.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 That is known as, then we are disqualifying our practices.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 We are not letting it go. You are holding onto that analyzer, whatever you are doing.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 Small thoughts, subtle thoughts, very counter-attainy thoughts,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000
 but we are distracted from the will, from the meditation.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 So, therefore, let it go, or liberating, self-liberating in the teaching state.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 You don't have to bring other tools to liberate anything out here.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 We don't need any other technical skills.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 Rapa is a fool, he cooked. It has all tools. Really, it has all tools.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 So, this time, the most important one is self-liberating.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 In the debate, it is called 'rangro', in the Dzokhi teachings, 'rangro'.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 Let, come, let it go. Those are simple words used in the country, too.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
 That is really liberating. That means that it goes.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 There is no more thinking. Earth's birds flying in the sky,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:09.000
 there is no trace of the feet, front, or the wings, or the body, at all.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 This means a writing code is the energy of the Dharmakaya,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 but when you let it go, there is no trace.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 No shadows or anything. This cane is gone.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 But you continue, or we continue, we continue maintaining

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 in the state space of the Dharmakaya.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000
 That means we are returning back to the home, sweet home,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 where we really belong.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 We are returning from the duality world to the calm and peaceful,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 vastness, infinite states.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 How wonderful. How beautiful.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 And that is there, in the way we are going to relax.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
 Already speaking, but then relax.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
 Don't make any effort to value that.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:10.000
 Relax your body, relax your speech, or wind, breathing.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 Relax your mind.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 Don't make any effort trying to do these things, anything.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 We are alternating the nature's discipline, and dualities, and relax.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 That is really with me.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 Then we are really advancing, we are flying.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 We are flying the vast space of Dharmakayas.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:38.000
 Exploring the horizon, there is no boundaries that we are really exploring.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 We reach the vastness.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 When you become master of that realization, what is the teaching?

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
 Sky yogis, sky yoginis.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 That means sky yogi in the sky.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
 There is no blockage of the dualities, blocking anything.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:00.000
 It is pervasive, panoramic view, view of the natural way things are.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
 So that is what this really teaching is.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
 Again, so we continue to follow with that.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
 But that is our practice, the meditation.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
 During this time, all the time, all the time,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 you remember those are the same point of the teaching,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
 what really introduced in those greatest master lineages, really.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 High light to exactly pointing out the skills and techniques and methods,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
 how to discover the nature of the Buddha.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 Teaching, that is what is so with that.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.000
 And now to do that, again, continue to see what in the teaching said,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 with all the observations, joy and appreciation.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 That is so important.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
 We are going to practice meditation and practice,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:48.000
 listen to the teaching and observe the teaching with joy, with appreciation,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000
 with grateful, with graceful, thankful.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 And what in the teaching said, to thankful, to do we have the Buddha nature.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 How wonderful.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
 We are not worthless.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 We are not just insignificant.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 Truly we are the bright light, stars,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 in this vastness of the dharmakaya or the space,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
 or the space, dharmakaya space, or dharmadattu space.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 How wonderful, how beautiful.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 We have Buddha nature.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 That is the cause to become the Buddha.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 Buddha Kya Kya Muni had that cause and he followed,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 continue for that pursuit and explore and discover that and become Buddha.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
 And all the Bodhisattvas, same thing.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 And all the Buddhas, the past Buddhas, same thing.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 In the future Buddhas, same thing.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
 Now Buddhas, so many Buddhas in the different pure realms,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 or the different universes, according to the teaching.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.000
 Same thing.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 We have same nature.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000
 How wonderful.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000
 How beautiful.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 Feel happy in the joy.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 Really.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 Not just only we have the cause, cause of that video potential,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 but we have every opportunity, every opportunity.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000
 What in the teaching said?

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000
 We have the perfect best, B-A-S-E, best.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
 What that best?

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
 Eighteen endowments.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 Eighteen endowments, perfect.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 Eighteen endowments is not casual,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000
 it has need, love, cause and courage, two of them.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 And that also included, we have the perfect best of the mental mind too.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 Even though just have kind of beautiful form, the body and everything,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
 but our mind is turned the complete opposite direction.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 We are from the Dharma.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 Then it doesn't work.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 So that means we have the perfect physical situation

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 and the perfect mental situation

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 that line up to discover our Buddha nature and Buddha.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 How wonderful.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000
 How beautiful.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
 In this world, there are so many human populations.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 They say it's glory that.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
 But how many among that people?

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
 How many people are really thinking?

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 And usually that's the perfect risk.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
 To benefit one's heart, to benefit all the beings.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 In the context of love, kindness, compassion, non-lawless,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
 how many people do?

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000
 And among that, we think that we have some quite good qualities.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
 It's not something we feel arrogance in.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 Kind of like that.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 But we should be happy.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 We shouldn't be depressed and boring and kind of bold.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 That we're really taking good meaning for our lives.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
 We're using this operation.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
 Large operation potentials.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
 Then not just only that we have all those basis,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 but we have lineage teachings.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
 Lineage teaching and how many of those people

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000
 have the opportunity to meet so many great qualified masters?

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 One after another.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000
 Really.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 Those are the guidance who assures us

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 to help, to discover, to bring the maturity of our Mother Nature.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 Nature.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 So we are, we are, help so many of those remarks.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
 Not just only we met the lineage masters,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 but we also received so many teachings.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 Nugget teaching, variety teachings.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
 Really we reached this.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
 So that means we got all the, okay,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 situation and circumstance are very perfectly beautiful ways.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 Therefore, we should be happy in joy,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
 have courage and commitment.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 You did something we do purpose.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000
 To propose that to discover and help to one's own self

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
 and as well as others.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
 Those are the teachings that joy is so important.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 Appreciations.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000
 And along with that also reflecting four renowned session thoughts

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 that we all know.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.000
 You practice Mundu.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
 This is not renunciation practice.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
 It is a Mundu practice.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
 But it is always in the teachings said,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 every session every day of like that is for renunciation thoughts.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 It will, what we will make.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
 It will make our heart more supple, more tender.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
 We become more practical.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000
 This will help to open our sense, sensible.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 We become, it will be more common sense in our heart and mind.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
 It is four renowned sessions.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
 Also, you know, a precious body.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
 Precious body, impermanent.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 Cause and effect are inevitable.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
 And Samsara has challenges and difficulties.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000
 Those are just basic things, basic general things.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 Things, but it is true.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 It's not just a talking Buddhism.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.000
 It's a struggle.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
 But after we go through this, we have that.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 So reflecting things is what makes more practical ourself.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
 More sensible as I said.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
 More really we will use our life very more perfectly, beautiful.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 Not going to kind of do so many things.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000
 That unnecessary, that not going to benefit ourself to the others.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000
 Or maybe even hurting one's own self and hurting others.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
 We won't do too many things.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
 And therefore, it is those all good.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.000
 With this, and then, suggest what is the motivation of the bodhijara.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000
 And the level of the bodhijara for all the sentient beings.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000
 When we are starting teaching, we should have bodhijara.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 When we are contemplating on the teaching, we should have the bodhijara.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 We should, when we are meditating, we start with the bodhijara.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:57.000
 Bodhijara is a low in kindness, compassion, kindness for all the sentient beings.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000
 Those are the central columns of the practices.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 We shouldn't miss.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 We shouldn't kind of ignore that.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000
 We do it like, oh, bodhijara, always they kind of talk bodhijara, bodhijara.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 Always talk to Joe and appreciate everything.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000
 Always just kind of formulate again, same thing.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000
 If we have that attitude, that means we are not feeling precious.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000
 We are not really precious. We are not taking to the heart.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000
 Those are the fundamental.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 We have no thought in the heart and the mind.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000
 Read it, then it will make practice so powerful, more fresh.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
 It will make more fresh.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 Practice it with God.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
 At the beginning time, many times we have so much excitement,

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
 joy and appreciation and devotion.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
 All those are siblings.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
 But as we go in the path and practice it for a long time,

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000
 then it's kind of almost getting dimmer, dimmer.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 Let's put the dimmer.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 Will you put this dim now?

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
 They are going home and gone.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 They know most of going pathway. Why?

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000
 Because these basic things are missing.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:06.000
 Joy and appreciation, poor renunciation, and bodhijara.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000
 Really, we are kind of feel, oh, this is just casual.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000
 Not casual. It is center. It is foundation.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
 It is a goal.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000
 It is like in the food, what do we call it?

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
 They call it fiber.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
 F-I-B-E-R, fiber.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
 They are notations.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.000
 Notations.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
 Really, it is multiple notations.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000
 Every message goes, even in teaching,

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 even if you practice zookin, it becomes hollow.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.000
 Shallow.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
 It is non-notations.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 Non-notations.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000
 It is just kind of senseless or empty.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 Empty.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 And then we become dimmer, center.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 Because then our teaching, dharma, zookin,

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:54.000
 is not mended with heart, and then become more teaching,

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
 more practices.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000
 That means we talk, oh, we are practicing zookin.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000
 We are practicing this, but only by mouth.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 Not really by heart.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000
 In order to do that, in order to avoid that,

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000
 then really to activate this every day.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 This is our practice.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000
 That is the meditation.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
 Even if we have a house or a building,

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
 we have to maintain that.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 And now one time, we have to do everything,

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 and then go, no, we have to keep maintaining,

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000
 and taking care of that.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000
 That really brings the growth.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000
 So those all in the teaching said,

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 and with that, I cannot go into it.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000
 Everything is seen as a mandala of the Buddhas,

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000
 those pure vegans.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000
 We are talking in this field.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000
 Yesterday, we spoke of the pure vegans,

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.000
 and this pure vegans is really the reality of nature,

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
 according to the teaching.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
 So the pure vegans of the three kaya,

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000
 dharma kaya, sambho kaya,

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000
 and makaya realizations.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000
 So those are understanding,

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000
 and now we go to the teaching.
