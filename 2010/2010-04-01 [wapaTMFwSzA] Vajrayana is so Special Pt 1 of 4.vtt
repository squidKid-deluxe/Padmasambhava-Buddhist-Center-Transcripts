 "The Fortunately Base of Tibetan", or "The Fortunately Base of Tibetan".

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:20.280
 "The Fortunately Base of Tibetan" is not always common, it is rare to come.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:36.440
 At the ancient time, when the Mahabhagavata came, at that time he gave the secret Vajrayana

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:44.440
 teachings, for the vehicle of the secret Vajrayana.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:01:01.440
 When the Mahabhagavata came, the secret Vajrayana teachings did not give.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:15.720
 When the Mahabhagavata came, the secret Vajrayana teachings did not give.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:36.080
 When the Mahabhagavata came, the secret Vajrayana teachings did not give.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:51.520
 Mahabhagavata gave the teachings of the Mahayana and the Hinayana and the Sutraana teachings,

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.920
 but the secret Vajrayana teachings did not give.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:04.000
 In the future, not just only the past Buddha, the future Buddha, also Buddha is not going

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.640
 to give the Vajrayana teachings.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:14.240
 Why did they give those Vajrayana teachings?

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:39.760
 Because the individualists or the bigs are not ready.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:48.480
 Long before, in the ancient time, in many eons, in many eons before, there is called

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:56.840
 universe, known as kung fu universe, or era of the kung fu era, era at that time, known

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:10.080
 as the Buddha monzung jaapu, or the Buddha of the Jungjung Buddha, or prachankal Buddha,

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:16.040
 Buddha or ancient kind, king of the ancient kind, and this name of the Buddha, so this

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:26.400
 Buddha gave very extensively where they are the teachings.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:47.400
 Now, this time, the era of the Buddha shaktamari also gave lack of any other teachings.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:55.480
 And then in the future, there is one million eons passed with, don't the one million passed

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:02.840
 with millions of eons passed on, there is known as the era of the metal kung fu, or the

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:11.160
 time of the metal kung fu era, in that time, there is known as the Buddha japrami, who

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:17.800
 are similar like me, such as me, very, very extensively where the young or the single

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:27.640
 mother of the young are teaching.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:36.360
 And because these three times, why the very young are teaching, because these three times

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:43.800
 the beings are very prepared to receive the very young are teaching, or because of their

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:53.800
