00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.700
 So we're all turning the wheel of Dharma, the three wheels of study, contemplation, and practice.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:31.060
 Beautiful. When thinking about just as we begin any practice, of course, we're always going

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:38.860
 to be beginning with, reconnecting with our pure motivation. And here too, with our pure

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:48.180
 motivation of Dharma practice, Dharma contemplation, Dharma study, we're connecting with these

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:58.540
 three motivations, our renunciation, our Bodhichitta, our pure perception. So again, we hear this

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:06.580
 again and again and again. And the point is, in one voice from all of our great root teachers,

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:19.740
 Mr. and Paul Dinshera, all in one voice, all the way to the pure, primordial Buddha's motivation

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:30.220
 is pure. And by connecting with these three motivations, with our joy, our appreciation,

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:40.200
 but more contentment, more appreciation, less fixation, more contentment, we're able to

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:47.420
 just be, right? And that's the essence of our hinyana, or foundational practices. Really

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:53.820
 connecting with the pure motivation of our Bodhichitta, that our practice can truly be

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:00.540
 of benefit for countless sentient beings, that through actualizing our vast aspirations

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:08.060
 of Bodhichitta, we can actually become the sources of refuge and benefit for all beings

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:15.100
 to find their own peace. And then through that, the vast connecting with our devotion

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:22.660
 and trust with the purity of all innate, in all phenomena, the innate goodness qualities

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:30.580
 of our own mind and heart, as well as every living being and all phenomena arising. That's

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:37.400
 the essence of our Vajrayana practice. And so we're beginning with this vital instructions,

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.220
 because that's the whole path. That's the whole practice where with each stage, even

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.020
 though we have these stages in our practice of like good in the beginning, good in the

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:53.820
 middle, good in the end, it means we're not leaving anything behind. We're touching home

00:02:53.820 --> 00:03:03.500
 base. We're settling into our joy, our appreciation, vast Bodhichitta, open, trusting, you know,

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:09.620
 devotion and pure perception as best we can with that purity aspect of things. That's

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:17.180
 the essence of the path. That's the whole path. That's all the whole ninyanas in being

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:25.020
 practiced in one drop, you know. And then as we progress and continue with our study, our

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:30.780
 contemplation, our practice, it's only becoming more and more rich, but these are the three

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:38.940
 vital ingredients. And then kind of along with that, I just thought to remind myself

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:47.660
 and all of us too of, you know, wisdom is so vital to the practice, right, seeing things

00:03:47.660 --> 00:04:01.860
 as they are. And so as we sit down to practice or do anything in the day, again, in that

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:08.660
 same kind of tone, the ideal is we're touching home base with our practice, not as an in

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:23.500
 an escape or a escape room, you know, but more as like connecting what's always present.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:30.940
 And of course, really central in the Buddhist teachings is the great awareness of great

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:37.700
 emptiness. So, you know, often I think we don't necessarily have it in our nundra practice,

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:45.460
 but in many of the sadhanas we practice, we have this really famous mantra, home, swabhava,

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:55.980
 shuddha, sarva, dharma, sobhava, shudho, hang. So you may or may not remember some of that.

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:04.260
 But the point is, that's really essential view in the teachings, that again, as we start

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:10.100
 our practice, as we continue our practice remaining in an open way, connecting with

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:19.740
 this view of what? Of the great emptiness, the openness of our situation, that we are

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:27.900
 like Rinpoche say, connecting with the transcendental wisdom rainbow body of our experience.

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:27.900
 Nothing

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:37.900
 is fixed. Nothing is solid. Nothing is permanent, independent, you know, everything is open,

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:43.820
 really connecting. So oh, again, this is the point of this is remembering this basic view

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:51.020
 we're trying to not only hold, but establish with our meditation, support with our conduct,

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:58.620
 and eventually we have the fruit, right? So ohm, swabhava, shuddha, sarva, dharma, sobhava,

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:06.060
 shudho, hang. Of course, Sanskrit language is so profound, there's no one meaning to

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:13.100
 these mantras, but some things we can connect with conceptually here and release into the

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:22.140
 great ocean are, you know, ohm is just again, like auspiciousness of all that is appearing.

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:37.260
 And swabhava is kind of like self nature. Shuddha means purity, you know, the purity

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:47.580
 of the true nature that doesn't have any fabrication or kind of contrivedness just from beginning

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:47.740
less

00:06:47.740 --> 00:07:02.620
 time, the self nature is always present and open. Sarva, dharma is, you know, all Sarva

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:17.020
 is all dharma, all phenomena, all phenomena is open, empty, of being solid, independent,

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:25.500
 permanent. Swabhava, shuddho, hang, you know, we're doing to maintain our connection with

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:38.140
 the nature of innate purity, the openness of our situation. So we start with, right, the

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:44.460
 difference in the teachings between fully realized Buddha and ordinary being is the

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:54.860
 degree to which we recognize that purity nature, that open nature, that brilliant sizzling

00:07:54.860 --> 00:08:07.980
 wisdom nature, omniscient love, compassion, wisdom. So remembering in our practice, we're

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:13.980
 not trying to be calm or be something we're not, we're just trying to really connect with

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:31.100
 how things are and dispel, you know, what's untrue, dispel our wrong views. So I guess

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:36.140
 without getting too wordy here, the point here is when we're beginning our practice

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:47.260
 to just really as much as we can connect with that view of openness, emptiness, or in some

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:57.980
 ways like recognizing the dream of our experience, because again, the emptiness nature, clearly

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:10.700
 the Buddha pointed isn't a void state, a dull state, a negation state. It's beyond existing,

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:26.740
 not existing both, neither. And our path is to connect with that. And so something I think

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:34.580
 we all can relate to is if it is our dreams themselves, you know, recognizing this is

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:40.300
 a dream. In the big sense, of course, we have our dreams at night. And maybe if I'm sure

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:48.460
 everyone to some degree has had the experience of while we're sleeping in a dream sleep dream,

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:54.060
 recognizing it was a dream to some degree. And that's something very independent and

00:09:54.060 --> 00:10:03.500
 personal and but what does our mind do with that when that happens, you know? And similarly,

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:13.380
 in this bardo of this life, of which our dreams are another bardo, the Buddha says, right,

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:25.380
 like dreams, firings, clouds, do bubbles, magical displays. Thus, we should view all

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:37.100
 compounded things, all phenomena. So when we're beginning our practice, just sitting

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:45.700
 in that open question, recognizing this is a dream. Yes, we're all always, no matter

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:51.780
 what, no matter how painful and obscured our experience, or no matter which level of the

00:10:51.780 --> 00:11:04.100
 boomies were on or the paths, always and forever beyond the three times our experience is insepar

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:04.420
able

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:16.180
 from this purity primordial openness nature of our own mind. And so in some ways, we don't

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:22.340
 have to worry, oh, I'm not enlightened, or like, oh, I'm like feeling really anxious,

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:32.420
 or whatever, or so just as we start our practice, just being however we connect, recognizing

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:41.660
 this is a dream, this is open, this is my own mind. We each are the sovereigns of our

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:49.980
 own experience. You know, like we say in another one of our refuge prayers and our bodhicitta

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:58.660
 prayers, you know, samsara and nirvana are the same. It's our perspective that makes

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:07.340
 the difference. Therefore, we're expand and connect with our bodhicitta that's pervading

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:23.300
 all our experiences. And so even at the beginning of our practice, we're starting with connecting

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:30.980
 with that openness. That again, isn't a blank state, but just recognizing even if we're

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:40.120
 recognizing Oh, this is a dream. This is my mind. This is timeless. Emptiness shining forth

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:46.540
 as my this reality of this moment. That's part of this connecting with the five perfections

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:55.340
 in our devotion, you know, this is the perfect place, perfect time, perfect teacher, perfect

00:12:55.340 --> 00:13:09.300
 teachings, perfect assembly, to recognize the always and forever Dharma of wisdom, compassion,

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:18.140
 power, love, that's always pervading, no matter what our experience. And again, not to deny

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:23.580
 how we're feeling, but sometimes, you know, it can help us kind of just get a little breath

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:33.340
 and openness to our situation recognizing that. You know, like, I think Kompopa says in one

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:41.140
 of his great treatises, that's showing the whole path, you know, the nature, nature of

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:53.220
 samsara is samsara is what miracle of not knowing how things are, right? Ignorance, attachment,

00:13:53.220 --> 00:14:04.580
 awareness. So as we, the nature of samsara is empty and open. And its quality is confusion

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:14.380
 and challenge and suffering. The nature of samsara, I mean, the s the nature of nirvana

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:26.940
 is also emptiness. But its quality is freedom from suffering, openness, omniscience, wisdom,

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:34.260
 peace. So just having those little views, or even as we're doing the visualization,

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:43.900
 I think not disassociating or thinking our current experience is wrong in a moral sense.

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:51.620
 We've had wrong view, right, of that things, I'm solid, I exist, you know, there's things

00:14:51.620 --> 00:15:12.460
 that can help me and things that can hurt me and all that. Really briefly, crudely said.

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:19.040
 But what we're feeling, what we're feeling if we can just remember that this is all based

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:27.860
 in the great, our own great, vast nature. And even though we might be like little babes

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:35.340
 in the brambles, we have the great support of like the living buddhas who have fully

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:43.820
 recognized that nature, and who effortlessly, indestructibly, naturally, uncontrived are

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:54.020
 always shining and displaying to bring us, you know, support to recognize that nature.

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:59.660
 Or as we're visualizing ourselves as yashe sojal and doing our guru yoga with Guru Padma

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:07.380
 Sambava. Of course, the visualization is wonderful and really helps us to recognize, to kind

00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:14.340
 of get out of our habitual pattern of our fixed idea of what's possible. But at the

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:22.220
 same time, we don't want to be pushing away our current perceptions as well. Just kind

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:31.940
 of gently remembering that it's all purity. It's all empty. And the point of our practice

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:38.500
 is we're gradually becoming more and more familiar with think how things are more and

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:49.140
 more. Sorry, I'm just going to look at my notes. More and more familiar with how things

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:57.320
 are until we have that. And our nundro practice itself, like I mentioned at the beginning,

00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:10.500
 it is the foundation practices for our zokchen, for the great perfection. That means it's

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:19.100
 setting the stage with our nundro practice, are all the foundations for recognizing this

00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:34.580
 emptiness awareness that's, again, beyond extremes. Again, recognizing the dream, recognizing

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:46.540
 the dreamer, looking to the looker, resting in that place, not rejecting our current experience

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:55.580
 for what it's not, and not fixating or grasping and contracting into what we think it is,

00:17:55.580 --> 00:18:07.300
 but kind of this middle way approach. That mind is beyond all extremes of how we composite

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:19.980
 things are, just resting in that openness. So realizing the great perfection, and then

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:25.900
 these foundation practices we're doing, just are helping us to deepen our realization of

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:37.500
 that. And so again, all these five main sections of our nundro, from the very beginning, we're

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:42.300
 starting with remembering this great openness awareness, even though we may not have this

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:51.540
 mantra I mentioned at the beginning, just even from the very beginning, home, our emptiness

00:18:51.540 --> 00:19:01.860
 awareness, the true face of the lama, through all the unfoldings and meanings of the seven

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:13.820
 line prayer, reflecting on the four thoughts, again, remembering the lama, reflecting on

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:25.620
 the four thoughts that turn the mind towards the dharma, towards what's true and reliable,

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:34.700
 which is the essence of taking refuge in the three jewels, the Buddha, the Dharma, the Sangha,

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:49.260
 in the three roots, the Guru, the Yiddam, Dakini, in the three aspects of true nature

00:19:49.260 --> 00:20:03.860
 of our own mind, the three caayas, the Dharmakaya, Sambhogakaya, Nermanakaya. Again, we're taking

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:11.220
 refuge in the Buddha, the three jewels, the three roots, all embodied as Guru Padmasambhava,

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:19.780
 as the embodiment of all the fully awakened ones. But also inherently, it's also that

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:28.380
 we have the deep trust in our own innate goodness, in nature qualities. And we're just beyond

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:34.820
 duality mingling with recognizing our true nature.

00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:47.220
 Again, before this great realization of wisdom and openness, awareness, emptiness, awareness,

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:55.420
 we connect with our bodhicitta motivation. We try to actualize that again through what?

00:20:55.420 --> 00:21:04.220
 By accumulating our merit, which always begins with the activity of kindling all the fire

00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:12.460
 of activating the accumulation of merit, which is essentially a generous heart that's aware

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:22.340
 of great openness and emptiness and dedicating courageously everything towards the realization

00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:37.020
 of nature. And then in our Vajrasattva practice, recognizing, you know, purifying our mistaken

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:57.380
 and twisted view and our mistaken and troublesome meditation and our really unsatisfying conduct,

00:21:57.380 --> 00:22:04.980
 be it from just not recognizing we haven't fully recognized the dream or along with that

00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:14.140
 any ways that we've kind of acted against what we know is better. But the essence here

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:27.060
 is like purifying, realigning with right view, right meditation, right conduct. So I hope

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:34.360
 I'm not confusing people here. I was just saying, we always have a view and we always

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:40.460
 have our doing things that can help uphold that view and make it seem, you know, see

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:46.020
 how it's more, you know, strength in that view and conduct that holds that up. So here

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:56.940
 by wrong view, I'm meaning the wrong view that we're solid, independent, permanent,

00:22:56.940 --> 00:23:05.220
 not wrong view. And all the ways in which we help to support that with our hopes and

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:13.220
 fears and actions done out of hope and fear and ignorance that creates what? Samsara.

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:22.860
 But no, here we're recognizing that mistake and purifying through the four powers and

00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:31.020
 connecting with the right view of openness, bodhicitta, continuing with our, you know,

00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:37.820
 again what we truly mean on the path of Dharma with right view, meditation that upholds the

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:44.900
 view of recognizing the openness of our mind, conduct of accumulating merit that creates

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:51.740
 more and more circumstances on the relative level for us to bring about that peace and

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:58.380
 harmony and balance and realization of wisdom, whose fruit is again, moving through the paths

00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:05.700
 and boomies all the way to Buddhahood for the benefit of all beings. And then again,

00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:13.860
 purifying, I mean, purifying yes, but then the supreme blessings of the guru yoga of

00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:20.500
 again mingling our mind with the essence of all the fully enlightened ones of all time

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:26.980
 and space embodied as guru Padma Sambhava, inseparable from the root teachers of this

00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:37.860
 life, inseparable from the Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, inseparable from, you know, the guru

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:50.500
 Deva Dakini, fully realized through Kaya and mingling ourselves with that with again the

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:57.820
 great support of guru Padma Sambhava and our root teacher, their instructions, taking them

00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:06.620
 to heart is what we're trying to do. Like we say in our prayers, again, from that very

00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:15.140
 first home of emptiness awareness through even in the guru yoga, you know, at the end

00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:22.140
 of guru yoga, what do we do? We have that prayer, guru, Lama, embodiment of all the

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:28.820
 Buddhas of the three times, please be aware of me in this and future lives and in the

00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:35.450
 Bardo and these three, hold me with your compassion. Bless me ceaselessly throughout the three

00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:36.460
 times,

00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:43.100
 you know, making that deep connection again, no matter what our current perception, keeping

00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:49.780
 that beautiful connection. And then again, even at the very end of our practice, we're

00:25:49.780 --> 00:26:05.100
 connecting with the true nature, the great perfection and the Lama, right? deity mantra

00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:12.420
 and Dharma Kaya are the nature of all appearance, sound and awareness, the pervasive Kaya and

00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:18.860
 wisdom display of the Buddhas. You know, may we practitioners of the profound and secret

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:27.540
 great perfection, we students on the path, we babes, you know, maybe we remain inseparable

00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:35.540
 from the innermost one taste awareness of wisdom mind in our own direct experience,

00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:46.260
 but also kind of remembering inseparable from the Lama. So maybe I've had enough banter,

00:26:46.260 --> 00:27:01.300
 but let's do the practice. Remembering great openness, great awareness as we go, connecting

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:11.140
 with our joy, our devotion, our bodhicitta, recognizing this dream as a dream, looking

00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:21.380
 to the dreamer, and then engaging, you know, again, with with the view, meditation, conduct.

00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:26.100
 So we'll just do seven line prayer, and then we'll go to the the Noondrow.
