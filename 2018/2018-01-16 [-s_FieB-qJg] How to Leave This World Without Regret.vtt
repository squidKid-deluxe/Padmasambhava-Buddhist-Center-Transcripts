00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
 It happened by accident, truly this great master, great practitioner, made so much journey for

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:13.110
 effort, devotion, courage, and commitment, and practice, meditation, and day practice, continuous

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.760
 ongoing lineage, like in the teaching, you say, golden mountain, stainless golden mountain, lineage

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:27.000
, chain of the stainless golden mountain, were kept in this practice with love, with completion,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.720
 with non-violence.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.140
 With appreciation, we also humbled, humiliated, kept this teaching. Today we are connected with

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.360
 these teachings. I mean, you are connected, not just today, you are all connected.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:51.320
 Therefore, also we shall feel great, enjoy. A cold Buddhism, in the Buddha thinking, there is no

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.000
 cold accidentally, there is cold conditions.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.760
 Since we are connected with such a great teaching, it has a lot of good cause and conditions.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:10.340
 Should we appreciate, thankful, grateful, and take the moment, take the opportunity, apply these

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.220
 teachings to the heart, not just for two days, two weeks, or two months, or years, and kind of drop

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.600
 these things.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:25.840
 That happens many times in the practice. Those are known as obstacles. Obstacles damage the heart.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:32.640
 What is heard into them more is those who do them, those who do those things.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:39.210
 It is happening in the multitude, so many times, just kind of like, they have the starting time, so

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.760
 enthusiastic, so joh, so loud, completely, and then kind of like, doubt and hesitation and the

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.880
 skeptical, destruction times, all that, and then finally drop.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:59.920
 And then back to when we survived, back to start. That is not a problem, not a burden. In a way, it

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.040
 is disappointing, disappointing.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:09.620
 Leave this world, we need to say this moment is one of the best wars and disasters that we can face

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:10.800
 in our lives.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:17.990
 We should leave this world with joy and appreciation, fulfillment, and then we have some

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:25.920
 destination to target. That's wonderful. We need this destination, and we need gold.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:32.040
 Even if we don't have the complete partnership with this destination, we should leave this world

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:40.480
 with joy and appreciation, fulfillment, with content attitude, that is good.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:47.840
 One great master, he's from the university, said, "We should leave this world without any regret,

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.400
 regret, and disappointment."

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:57.210
 That is not good. And therefore, again, personally, with half in joy, that sense we are connected,

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:02.560
 such as this great teaching and great, beautiful teaching, the love and content.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:09.440
 This teaching is not, we're not practicing to please someone or to make our heart in someone.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:15.500
 Or we're scared or we don't practice, or we're not going to practice. We're practicing that for

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.480
 ourselves.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.530
 Then everything, pain, for all living with, token with, that will speed our realization, our

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:23.840
 understanding.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:31.200
 Leave this world. And therefore, this practice, for us, we look, revealing our own nature, our

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.960
 beauty for our colors, our enlightened state, what we have there.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:43.080
 And it will move away and kind of reducing the obstacles, the hindrances, that which are making

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:49.360
 obstacles to us, hindrances, throughout the lifetime, or even this lifetime.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:57.360
 That is what we are really doing. So therefore, it is so to joy and appreciation, and now with this

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.360
...
