00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.940
 Welcome everyone. Thank you. Thank you very much. Welcome. And now, again, we discuss

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:31.390
 the teachings about the gracious teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni, and as well as the great Yabji Vinyu

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:32.360
 Rinpoche, the echo of the essence teaching of Buddha Shakyamuni.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:42.370
 So we follow that instructions. Now, advice to the fortunate students. And so we're following that.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.200
 And that, again, in here, in a sixth line of these words,

00:00:47.200 --> 00:01:01.530
 they have the strong confidence, confidence with trust, trust that the three jewels are an imperil

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.600
able source of rapture. I kind of highlighted this in here.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:14.470
 I highlighted that. But in the teaching here, I said three jewels, trusty, and imperilable. Those

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.440
 are the three kind of points, man.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:25.950
 So now we're talking about three jewels. I'm going about three jewels. And we're reminded to each

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.760
 other about three jewels.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:35.150
 We all talk ruffles. We all have the ruffled ones. So we oppose, we all know about the Buddha dharm

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.920
asanga.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.230
 It's just that every day we do practices, and the child and the tech ruffled, we know that. But

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.280
 again, it's just that we activate it.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.800
 That memory and knowledge is very good and is a part of our practices. And also is a part of the

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.440
 practice of the virus, studying, contemplating that.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:02:00.060
 So we're kind of starting that and then contemplating of those kind of little bit of deterral

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.440
 meanings of those, each point.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.440
 That's what really we've been doing. And we discussed about the Buddha here, Buddhas.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:14.540
 And now we're going to go back to dharmas here today. And Dharma is a symbol to tell his message in

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.800
 the teaching of the Buddha.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:24.900
 Buddha who is embodied, oh, Buddhas are the embodiment of loving, loving kindness, compassion, and

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.800
 wisdom, and for all living beings, or love and compassion, for all living beings,

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.800
 understanding everything exactly, clearly as it is. And that's really about Buddha. So therefore,

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.800
 that was also Buddha's practices.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:47.290
 Whether Buddha, the male Buddha or the human Buddha, they practice it, they meditate it, and they

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.800
 then become the Buddha, so that means they achieve the ultimate state of loving kindness,

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.800
 compassion, and the Muslim.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:00.410
 And therefore, then they're also sharing their same realization, how they're reaching enlightenment

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:06.800
, their wisdom, their knowledge, their understanding, their experience, their sharing to us.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.860
 And that is the message of the teaching of the Buddha. So that is Dharma known as, in the Dharma,

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.800
 as I said, it has meaning of the correct thing and a protected thing.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:24.320
 At the same time, although it has meaning of the kind of, when you hold, you hold, or kind of, let

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:31.800
 not fall down, or fell down in the ditch or the samsara, so it will kind of held up that.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.800
 Those are the meaning of the Dharma, as well. So that is really Dharma.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:45.730
 In Dharma, then we have mentioned it yesterday, about Dharma, there is the Dharma of the scriptural

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.800
 Dharma and the realization Dharma.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:57.180
 And the scriptural Dharma is then, what in the teaching said, it is the path and the cessation are

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.800
 the, the really Dharma, path and cessation.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:09.490
 So that means, practicing of the teaching, in the realization of the teaching, is really the Dharma

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.800
, Dharma.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:16.320
 But that we won't get immediately, we won't get immediately realization, and we have to also know

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.800
 how to practice it.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:22.800
 So therefore, then the scriptural Dharma is, scriptural Dharma.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:29.760
 The scriptural Dharma is, then, as I said, it can be divided, the scriptural Dharma of the Buddha's

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:30.800
 teaching.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:38.280
 And the scriptural Dharma of the commentary of the great masters on the Buddha's teaching, those

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.800
 are the true, true kind of division of the scriptural teachings.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:51.430
 And now, again, the Buddha's teaching, over there is the commentary teaching, but all is best or

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.800
 essentialized into three, three meanings.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:02.800
 And those meanings are morality, concentration, and wisdoms.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.800
 And with those statements, those are the meaning, meaning of the Dharma.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.800
 We are making of those different, different three points, such as morality.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.800
 The morality teaching is mainly explaining of the Vinaya teachings.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:24.800
 The Vinaya teaching is mainly explaining the morality teachings, or the conduct, or the ethics.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:34.800
 And Sutra teaching is mainly teaching on the concentrations, above the minds, mainly in that.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:41.800
 And Abhidharma teaching is mainly teaching on the worst levels.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:49.290
 And knowledge, variety of the knowledge, knowledge on the absolute level, knowledge of the relevant

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:52.800
 truth, those are what we went through yesterday.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.800
 There will be really about that.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:01.800
 So those are known as the scriptures, teachings of the by Buddha Shakyamuni.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:08.920
 Then the commentaries of the teachings, those also represented the teachings, commentary teachings

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:15.800
 on the Vinaya, commentary teachings on the Sutra, commentary teachings on the Abhidharma.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.800
 Those are also known as scripture teachings.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.800
 Those are qualified teachers, one who wrote and composed those teachings.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:30.290
 Through the compassion and through the loving kindness, common kindness, and when they wrote those

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:31.800
 things, those are the scripture teachings.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:37.550
 Those are according to teaching, highlighted, such as those qualified masters, what are the

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:38.800
 teachings here?

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:44.800
 The best qualified teacher is the one who understands the perfect realization of the true nature.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:49.800
 That's the meaning, for example, "pasta boomis" or maybe more, more than that.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:59.560
 And the second of those qualified teachers are the one who understands the direct communication

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:04.800
 with the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, direct communication.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:10.700
 And that means also their heart and mind are filled with love, kindness, and compassion, and also

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:17.800
 kind of remove the summary of the self-important ego clings and worldly concerns.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:21.800
 Those really remove this filled heart, and more gentle, more peaceful.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:28.320
 And because of those beautiful qualities and practices, they have the ability to have the

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:32.800
 connection, the regular communication with the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:37.800
 So those are known as the middle couple of the practicing.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:46.200
 And the third couple of those practicing, those masters, known as one who understands the perfect

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:49.800
 meaning of the old five art of sciences.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.800
 Those five sciences are perfect knowledge.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:58.600
 Buddha is teaching total knowledge, such as Vinaya teaching, Sutra teaching, Abhidharma teaching,

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:04.800
 all the Vedayana teaching, mayana teaching, the Pandayana Buddhist School teaching.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:11.540
 All those clearly, perfectly, beautifully, and with the intention of like to clarp, clarification

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:15.800
 of the teaching, like to benefit to the other beings.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:23.910
 That intention, we don't have any self-important or any reason, really love and kindness and

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:30.370
 compassion, and respect and appreciation, and something of clarification that should prevent

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:31.800
 benefit to the others.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:41.400
 Others then wrote the commentary, those are known as the third couple of the practices, higher,

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:45.800
 medium, and then lesser couple of those.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.110
 Those are, and those were wrote in such as high cover, whether blood-grade masters, such as nadunas

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:58.800
, basu-vendus, asangas, and then as well as sangurapimas, sambhava, or santa-rachata.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:03.800
 All those are high in the cover, blood practice. I mean, grade masters.

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:10.800
 And then as well as the, maya also could be medium, too. One has communication, those categories.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:16.100
 And then third one is, is one who knowledge, perfectly, beautifully knows all the teachings, and

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:24.270
 plus other knowledge of those, like, those are known as the qualification masters who wrote the

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:25.800
 books and commentary.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:40.800
 So that is really the, basically about dharma. Again, as I said the other day, and you all know,

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:50.910
 nature of dharma, again, I say, simply, simply say, nature of dharma is non-violence, and truth,

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:52.800
 and peace.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:58.800
 Peace, and harmony, and respect, and appreciation to all living beings.

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:08.310
 And discover metal that will discover our innate nature and beauty of all these objects, all these

00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:09.800
 phenomena.

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:17.930
 That is really the teaching. That is the symbol which tells the message for the teaching of dharma,

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:18.800
 dharma.

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:27.320
 Now, again, I'll tell you something, a little bit, to highlight that, maybe more simplifying of

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:32.800
 this description and realization I translated. Realizations.

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:44.110
 And, again, as I say, simple examples, what is scripture, the secret of the teaching. For example,

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:57.800
 when we read or learn, taking lives of others is not good, is unwholesome, is not good.

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:04.800
 Taking lives of others, doesn't matter who were there, is not good, according to Buddhism.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:15.800
 When you know that, when you understood that, that is known as spiritual knowledge. We understand.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:24.200
 With that knowledge, we follow that activity, that teaching, follow that, and always try and hope

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:27.800
 for, not taking lives of other beings.

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:36.060
 When we apply that teaching, that is realization. That is your applying the meaning, not just only

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:39.800
 intellectuals, but your applying.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:51.800
 So, that is known as a simple way to tell of the difference of the scripture and realization.

00:11:51.800 --> 00:12:00.800
 In other words, for example, we see all in the teaching, all the phenomena are emptiness.

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:07.900
 When you heard that, and with that, all the different reasons you went through, all the teaching

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:08.800
 went through,

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:13.800
 and something you got, or that already makes sense, is all emptiness.

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:20.800
 When you got that knowledge, that is known as the knowledge of the scriptures.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:29.060
 When you had that knowledge, and you start meditating, and meditating, and get some degree of that

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:29.800
 meaning,

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:38.800
 taking to your mind, or to your heart, that is realization. So, that is what is.

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:44.800
 The old method in the teaching always means realization is the true Dharma.

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:51.800
 Realization is the true Dharma, all but Dharma. So, that is really about the Dharma.

00:12:51.800 --> 00:13:02.450
 Now, I said yesterday, I am going to mention, this scriptural Dharma can be divided, Sutra, sorry

00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:05.800
 Vinaya, Sutra and Abhidhana.

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:10.930
 Dharma, we said, then where is, for example now, maybe you are wondering, where is Vighyana

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:11.800
 teaching?

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:17.980
 Is this part of the Sutra, or is part of the Vinaya, or is it part of the Abhidhana, it is the

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:18.800
 thing.

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:26.660
 And again, there are different teachings, great masters interpreted, and following also, according

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:28.800
 to the teaching of the Buddha.

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:36.800
 Buddha, and so, for example, as I take the quotation yesterday, from the king of all creation,

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:49.960
 then Buddha gave 84,000 teachings, and 21,000 is Vinaya teaching, principally connected to

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:50.800
 discipline,

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:58.800
 discipline the attachment, and or discipline the attachment, Buddha gave 21,000 Vinaya teachings.

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:08.800
 21,000 teaching, Buddha gave Sutra teaching, or to dispel or discipline, remove the anger.

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:15.800
 And 21,000 Buddha gave teachings, or to dispel the ignorance.

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:26.970
 Anyway, so now at the moment of 20, 84,000 teachings, how many we count? We count, I believe, 63,

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:29.800
000 we went.

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:33.800
 So now they still have 21,000.

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:45.130
 In that Sutra teaching, 21,000 Buddha gave the teaching of the Vinaya teaching in order to dispel

00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:47.800
 all the emotions.

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:56.800
 So that means attachment, anger, angering, all targeted 21,000 Buddha gave teachings.

00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:05.180
 So therefore, in that way, we, in a way, pour different, not just three baskets of teaching, pour

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:07.800
 different baskets of teachings,

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:16.050
 according to Vedic energy. So if we added Vedic energy, it makes it pour baskets of teachings, that

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:16.800
 teachings.

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:24.900
 Then many graduate masters also said, "Oh, the Vedic energy can be summarized within the three

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:26.800
 baskets of teachings."

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:36.820
 Because Vedic energy has the same nature, Vedic energy has a teaching of morality, Vedic energy has

00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:38.800
 a teaching of concentration,

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:47.020
 Vedic energy has a teaching of wisdom, so therefore it can be summarized just in a three-pitaka, or

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:49.800
 three basket of teachings.

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:56.860
 And what are the morality teachings of Vedic energy? All the Samaya teachings, general Samaya

00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:57.800
 teachings,

00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:05.430
 perceived Samaya teachings of those who are from the deities, those are all known as morality

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:07.800
 teachings, ethics teachings.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:13.800
 Anyway, again, also there are so many meditations, concentrations.

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:19.780
 So many different meditations, such as vocabulary teachings, characterize the complete state of

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:21.800
 practices.

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:31.230
 So complete state of practices and vocabulary teachings, all those are, then, concentration

00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:32.800
 teachings.

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:40.100
 Teachings, it's concentrated teachings. Now, all these great

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:45.480
 imprenised teachings, such as Mahamudra teachings, other Dzogchi teachings, Thichu teachings, those

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:46.800
 are ultimate teachings on the westerns.

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:55.800
 And therefore, it all can be summarized into these three categories of the baskets.

00:16:55.800 --> 00:17:02.800
 Vinaya basket, sutta basket, abhidharma basket.

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:08.800
 Basket is if we translate, not just we, English translated, into English.

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:20.530
 Basket in Tibetan is the nu, nu, nu, and in Sanskrit is the pitaka, and the pitaka is also a

00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:21.800
 container.

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:27.800
 So those are the three basket teachings.

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:34.800
 Then sometimes Dharma can be also divided into two groups, all teachings,

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:42.800
 and Dharma of the basic Buddhist school teaching, and Dharma of Bodhisattva Yamas.

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:51.800
 So, Theravada teaching and Bodhisattva teachings, or Yana teachings, so true teachings.

00:17:51.800 --> 00:18:00.950
 The nature is the same, those three extraordinary trainings, such as morality and concentration,

00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:02.800
 and westerns are the same.

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:11.050
 But at the very kind of how to summarize, how I like that, how to bring, capture the meaning, the

00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:16.800
 essence, the understanding of this, entirely the reach of the teachings.

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:23.800
 So, Theravada or the Norwegian Buddhist teachings, and the Mahayana teachings.

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:30.800
 And Mahayana teaching can be divided into two, and casual Mahayana teachings,

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:37.800
 and that which is Sutra teachings, and Rizod Mahayana teachings, which is Vaidyana teachings.

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:44.800
 So, those are known as descriptions of the dharmas.

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:51.800
 So, as I said other day, or yesterday I said, Dharma we will understand in three ways,

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:59.800
 nature, division, and benefits, power, or power of the benefit.

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:08.830
 So, now what we went, we went nature of the dharma, and we went descriptions of the dharma,

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:09.800
 descriptions of dharma,

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:15.800
 or descriptions on the division of dharma, so the division of dharma.

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:22.360
 And now, the benefit of dharma, power or the benefit of dharma is simply in the Buddha teaching

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:26.800
 says, power over dharma is inconceivable.

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:29.800
 It's inconceivable.

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:37.900
 It's just even the hearing, the names of the Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, it will make the end of sams

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:38.800
ara.

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:46.430
 And even the names of hearing of the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha, it will open the door to the

00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:47.800
 enlightenment.

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:53.800
 And then every practice, it has so much power of powers.

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:57.800
 From that on, we are more settled.

00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:05.800
 From that on, we begin to see value in the important region of our own self.

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:13.800
 And we know at that moment, we understand value in the importance of all other living beings.

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:21.800
 That moment, that means we begin harmony, peace, respect, appreciation.

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:29.910
 As we continue to practice meditating and activate that teaching into the heart and mind, the power

00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:32.800
 grows, power deeper in it.

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:39.800
 Power is common as like building sunlight begin to now shine in the heart and mind.

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:46.830
 And that will shine, illuminate our own heart and mind, so we will have the benefit of all the

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:47.800
 beings.

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:54.800
 And we are reversing the direction of the samsara by practicing dharma.

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:58.800
 So this is really so powerful, so special.

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:05.790
 And there are so many beautiful stories, even the hearing, the names of the Buddhas, Buddhas or

00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:07.800
 Buddha, Dharma, Sangha.

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:10.800
 It came out of completely troubles.

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:17.800
 In the teachings in ancient time, some Martians went on the ocean to get the jewels.

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:25.800
 Always in the teachings, they were going to get the jewel, the material jewel from the ocean.

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:29.800
 And then they returned back to the land.

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:39.800
 And then they had the big troubles, big troubles of the second, second or the item.

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:43.800
 The item came there and there is nothing to do with anything.

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:47.800
 They are completely there, everyone has a danger in their lives.

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:50.800
 But immediately they call to that time.

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:57.420
 That time is like those like, I mean not those like that time, but it is still living as physical

00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:58.800
 forms in India.

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:02.800
 So they somewhat know about the Buddha and they just pray to the Buddha.

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:11.000
 That immediately they call in the teaching Buddha a bird right above the sky and then protect it

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.800
 from that danger of typhoons.

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:15.800
 So this is really one of the examples.

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:18.800
 There are many, numerous examples in the Buddhism.

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:26.060
 Buddhism by practicing meditating, it protected every vein and difficulty, troubles and fulfill all

00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:26.800
 the wishes.

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:33.800
 Then we have stone of course, devotions and then it comes so beautifully, perfectly.

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:38.800
 And those are where you all know in the teachings of the world.

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:42.800
 So my part of the teachings and as well as many other sources.

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:46.800
 So you can see how powerful and how benefited it is.

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:50.800
 So those are really about Dharma now.

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:57.800
 So now among the three jewels we talk about the Buddha, we talk about Dharma.

00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:01.800
 And now I go all the way above the Sanghas.

00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:03.800
 Now first I talk Sanghas.

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:10.800
 Sanghas is a Sanskrit word in the Tibetan translated as Gendun.

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:15.800
 In the eighth century those are great emanated in the last letters.

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:23.950
 And during that meal, during that time of the Kintasong Dibli, Guru Peyam Mahasanghavan, Great

00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:24.800
 Master, Shen Dalakkulas.

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:31.800
 During that time, this Sangha has translated it to be Gendun.

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:36.800
 In the English I think we kept loosely, everyone said not Sangha.

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:39.800
 So it's kept the same Sanskrit word.

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:43.800
 But what in the Tibetan translated how is there is two words.

00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:47.800
 Gay and Dindun.

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:50.800
 Gay means virtuous.

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:53.800
 Dindu means devoted.

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:54.800
 Devoted.

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:59.800
 So devoted to the virtuous.

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:02.800
 Or connected to the virtuous.

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:06.800
 Devoted or very much devoted.

00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:08.800
 Devoted to the virtuous.

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:18.410
 So that means, virtuous of course, we all discuss, I think quite a lot before those who are causing

00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:20.800
 effort in inevitable time.

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:23.800
 We did, and of course we all know that too.

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:27.800
 Virtuous is ten virtues.

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:35.800
 Three by the body, four by the speech, three by the mind, as we listed, then you know too.

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:38.800
 So those are known as virtues.

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:44.800
 So Sanghas are devoted to these virtues.

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:50.800
 So that a symbol to their actions, body activity is gentle and peaceful.

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:54.800
 Their verbal activity is gentle and peaceful.

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:58.800
 And their mind activity is more gentle and peaceful.

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:06.800
 And therefore, all their activities of the bodily speech, mind, amo, calm and peaceful, virtuous.

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:12.800
 And that also means burn, means in Tibetan translated, means devoted.

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:16.800
 How long until we reach the enlightenment?

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:21.800
 After we discover the final result, we devote it.

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:26.800
 So that is not just only for a short time devoted, but keeping that.

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:28.800
 When we do this, what is this?

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:35.790
 Also, when we are devoted to the virtues and discipline our activity of the bodily speech, mind,

00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:36.800
 then what is it?

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:40.800
 That captures the essence of the Buddha teaching.

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:47.470
 All those three basket teachings, what we are talking, all those meditation teachings, all that is

00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:48.800
 really what captures.

00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:50.800
 We are keeping.

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:57.800
 That is Buddha, the greatest teacher, Buddha Shakyamala himself said,

00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:05.900
 "Avoiding negative activities, perform the positive activities, discipline your mind. This is my

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:06.800
 teaching."

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:10.800
 That is what the greatest teacher said.

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:12.800
 That's it.

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:19.800
 Avoiding negative activities, perform the good activities or benefit your positive activities,

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:21.800
 discipline your mind.

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:24.800
 What means discipline your mind, for example?

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:27.800
 Discipline, of course, we think immediately wild mind.

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:29.800
 It's true, wild mind.

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:33.800
 But also it means cause of that quiet.

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:38.800
 Emotions, anger, jealous, it's important.

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:41.800
 Then fundamentally cause of ego clean.

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:48.800
 Just clean that. Avoid that.

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:50.800
 Avoid that.

00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:58.800
 Then that is really, we capture essence of the Dharma, essence of the teachings of the greatest

00:26:58.800 --> 00:26:58.800
 teacher,

00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:02.800
 teaching Buddha Shakyamuni and Gaurapayama Sambha, all the great masters.

00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:06.800
 Even maybe we don't have big names, these and that things.

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:11.800
 Things that we capture, we are drawn to the earth.

00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:15.800
 Drown to the earth, we are settled.

00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:22.800
 From that on, that practitioner, the Sangha member, is on the way to the enlightenment,

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:26.800
 way to benefit all the beings.

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:31.800
 So that is really, again I maybe went to that kind of like straight up there,

00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:34.800
 but that is the meaning of the Sangha.

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:39.800
 Sangha was devoted to the rituals.

00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:41.800
 So that is.

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:45.800
 And now, so that is the old meaning of the Sangha.

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:48.800
 The nature of the Sangha.

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:52.800
 Again I talk the same way as I spoke with the Dharma.

00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:57.800
 According to the teaching and the nature of the Sangha

00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:03.800
 and the division of the Sangha and the benefit of the Sanghas.

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:06.800
 Those are three different ways I talk.

00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:13.800
 And nature is also, as can be understand, as pretty much identity of the Sanghas.

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:17.800
 So nature and identity are the most same things.

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:19.800
 So what is the nature of the Sangha?

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:24.800
 The nature of the Sangha, some maybe have the understanding of the realization

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:31.800
 or perhaps of some realizations and also some really purified negativity.

00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:35.800
 That is known as Sangham, the nature of the Sangha.

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:37.800
 Identative Sangham.

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:38.800
 Sangham.

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:42.800
 So one who is, is purified,

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:47.800
 some relief of the negatives or process of the purified negatives

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:52.800
 and some relief of the realization coming, coming,

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:58.800
 or the process of the realization coming, that is the relief of the Sangham.

00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:00.800
 That is the Sanghas.

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:03.800
 And now, how many Sangha members?

00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:06.800
 Again, if we show, there is the Sangha members.

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:08.800
 Karjini is again show.

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:13.800
 Sangha members of the Theravada or the Pundit (Buddhist) School.

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:17.800
 Sangha members of the Mahayanas.

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:19.800
 Mahayanas.

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:25.800
 And that also, the Theravada Sangha member or the Pundit (Buddhist) Sangha member

00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:29.800
 also can be divided according to their realizations.

00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:33.800
 Those are, they ever say, positive movies.

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:40.800
 Or sorry, positive part, second part, third part of those things.

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:44.800
 All this is also known as poor results.

00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:47.800
 Poor result of the realizations.

00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:51.800
 Now, ensuring continuation.

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:56.800
 And returning one time, non-returning,

00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:01.800
 and Ahadapho, those are the poor different realization levels

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:08.800
 are mentioned in the Pundit (Buddhist) School.

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:12.800
 But if I just kind of simple, powerful one might be, most of the time,

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:16.800
 I think you know that the Sangha members of the past part,

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:22.800
 second part, and third part, fourth part.

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:25.800
 And then, fifth part.

00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:27.800
 Maybe that's what we understand.

00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:31.800
 And the first part as of course, many of you already know,

00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:36.800
 I will just name, those are the accumulation part.

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:40.800
 And second is the application part.

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:43.800
 Third is seeing part.

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:47.800
 And the fourth is the meditation part.

00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:55.800
 And fifth is no more studying or Ahadapho, part or realizations.

00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:58.800
 Those are the five parts.

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:01.800
 And then, accumulation part.

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:03.800
 Simple again, you tell.

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:08.800
 Accumulation part, you do a lot of meritorious activities.

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:12.800
 Particularly, meritorious activities of the physical,

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:16.800
 mentally or physically, verbally meritorious activities.

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:19.800
 Those are accumulation part.

00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:21.800
 Roughly or handsome.

00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:26.800
 With devotion, with courage, with commitment, with determination,

00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:29.800
 you do these things.

00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:31.800
 And concentration.

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:33.800
 All the morality practices.

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:35.800
 Concentration practice.

00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:37.800
 Bustin practice.

00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:42.800
 And the application part, that means from the accumulation part,

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:45.800
 now you reach to the application part.

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:50.800
 That means, now your strength of the practice is stronger.

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:52.800
 More stable.

00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:54.800
 More stable.

00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:55.800
 Stronger.

00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:57.800
 In a way, it is now one way.

00:31:57.800 --> 00:31:59.800
 Highway is not too many.

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:01.800
 Lingering back and forth.

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:03.800
 Almost one way.

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:05.800
 One way that you reach the highway.

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:06.800
 Highway that.

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:09.800
 And then, get realization.

00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:11.800
 And all your courage and commitment,

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:15.800
 confidence, those are growing or deepening.

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:18.800
 And those are, and also are some knowledge,

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:20.800
 understanding of the knowledge of true nature,

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:23.800
 of the emptiness is coming.

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:27.800
 Or emptiness, self-emptiness, such as egolessness.

00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:30.800
 Those realization is dawning.

00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:34.800
 This dawn of realization is booming or shining.

00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:37.800
 That is the application part.

00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:40.800
 And the next one is the seeing part.

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:43.800
 And the seeing part, you're now seeing the true nature,

00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:47.800
 exactly as it is, or egolessness realization,

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:52.800
 exactly as it is without the intellectual.

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:57.800
 Now you're not dependent on the intellectual egolessness status.

00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:01.800
 You really see, truly, it is emptiness.

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:05.800
 Ego, it's free from the egos, free from that.

00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:10.800
 So application also means, from that on, it is applying now.

00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:12.800
 It is conducting.

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:16.800
 It is a bridge to the realization.

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:21.800
 Until we reach the seeing part,

00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:24.800
 according to the seeking, we all practice,

00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:28.800
 and those are known as individualists, individual.

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:29.800
 Brother.

00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:30.800
 Individual.

00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:31.800
 Or only.

00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:34.800
 But seeing part, when you reach the seeing part,

00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:38.800
 that individually, now not just the only person,

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:41.800
 they are known as noble.

00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:43.800
 In a debate, it's a pop-up.

00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:44.800
 Pop-up.

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:47.800
 You now become the noble.

00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:50.800
 Because you're noble, you're elevated

00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:54.800
 from the duality of the ego clings, in a way.

00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:56.800
 You come out of that trap.

00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:01.800
 So, therefore, it's called noble, noble.

00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:04.800
 And then meditation part is,

00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:06.800
 so, therefore, all the Sangha members,

00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:09.800
 one after another, those are different Sangha members

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:14.800
 of the Theravada, or the basic Buddhist schools.

00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:19.800
 And then, Mahayana, again, two gurus.

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:23.800
 There is the Vedayana Sangha members,

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:26.800
 and then Mahayana Sangha members.

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:30.800
 Mahayana Sangha members are what is known as bodhisattvas.

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:33.800
 Mel and females.

00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:36.800
 And Vedayana Sangha members are named as,

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:40.800
 not named, known as, vedaydara, male and females.

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:44.800
 Or yogi, in a yogi-ness, those terminologies.

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:48.800
 But reality is all Mahayana, according to teaching.

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:49.800
 All Mahayana.

00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:53.800
 And again, they again begin to practice.

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:57.800
 Sangha members of the first Bhumi, second Bhumi, third Bhumi,

00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:00.800
 all Sangha members pass the path.

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:02.800
 I mean, same thing, that equivalent.

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:06.800
 But this time, more realization, and I said,

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:10.800
 it is much more deeper, much wider,

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:14.800
 and intention towards the more stronger and more deeper.

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:17.800
 And therefore, it's called also Mahayana.

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:21.800
 So, those are all Mahayana Sangha members.

00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:23.800
 And so, that is Mahayana.

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:25.800
 And now, I agree with this,

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:27.800
 that's how Mahayana is summarized.

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:30.800
 But now, I talk again to these all Sangha members,

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:33.800
 they were divided, not me,

00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:37.800
 is divided into two groups.

00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:40.800
 Again, only Sangha members.

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:44.800
 And noble Sangha members.

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:48.800
 Only Sangha members is just a regular Sangha member,

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:50.800
 beginning to practice.

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:54.800
 Those are the only Sangha members.

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:57.800
 All Sangha members, whether they are Theravada,

00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:00.800
 or whether they are Mahayana or the Vedayana Sangha,

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:02.800
 those who have the realization,

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:05.800
 they are the noble Sangha members.

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:07.800
 Sangha members.

00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:10.800
 And these only Sangha members,

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:14.800
 to make only Sangha members what we have to be,

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:18.800
 or to become an older Sangha member, what we have to be.

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:23.800
 A coded teaching, take the vows.

00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:26.800
 Vows, all those are the Raphudi vows,

00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:30.800
 all such as the Opasaka vows,

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:33.800
 all the Sharmas, there are Noah's monks,

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:35.800
 monks or nuns,

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:40.800
 or pulling all the monks and nuns,

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:41.800
 take the vows.

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:43.800
 You keep the vows.

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:46.800
 Read that vow, whatever you have there.

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:51.800
 Keep that vow and start meditating and practice it.

00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:53.800
 Practice it.

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:55.800
 With that meditation, practice it.

00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:58.800
 Also meditating on the great emptiness,

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:01.800
 all the according to the teachings, equalizing,

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:03.800
 so whatever you receive the teachings.

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:04.800
 Practice it.

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:07.800
 So that means, now you are keeping the morality,

00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:09.800
 you are keeping the concentration,

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:13.800
 you are keeping the wisdom, all combined together.

00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:16.800
 That is known as, then,

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:20.800
 that is how to start beginner Sangha members,

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:22.800
 or beginning Sanghas.

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:24.800
 Then every level of this strongly,

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:27.800
 particularly that only Sangha member

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:30.800
 could become to the novel Sangha members,

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:32.800
 according to the teachings.

00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:39.800
 So that is really about the division of the Sangha members.

00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:41.800
 Sangha members.

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:44.800
 That is about the benefit of the Sangha members.

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:48.800
 Again, what is really in the Buddha teachings is Sangha.

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:50.800
 So what can you say?

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:54.800
 The benefit of the Buddha is inconceivable,

00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:57.800
 the benefit of the Dharma is inconceivable,

00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:01.800
 and the benefit of the Sangha is inconceivable.

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:05.800
 So this is really, again, inconceivable.

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:07.800
 By practicing the Dharma,

00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:11.800
 Bharma, in the journey with the Sangha members,

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:15.800
 from that on, that individually become

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:18.800
 the object of veneration that the Buddha teaches.

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:20.800
 And the great Buddha, the Buddha Shakyamuni said,

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:24.800
 "No matter how bad my followers,

00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:30.800
 but they will be still quite better than many others."

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:34.800
 Others say, "Even, even you have to practice the Dharma,

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:37.800
 even did they activate it too strongly,

00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:40.800
 but still that individual has more knowledge

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:43.800
 of the loving kind of the completion,

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:47.800
 respect and appreciation for all the living beings,

00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:51.800
 more open mind, more practical, more known to the earth,

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:54.800
 more kind of with more common senses,

00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:56.800
 more senses and common senses,

00:38:56.800 --> 00:39:00.800
 those are really in the teachings said, "It has that."

00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:03.800
 And then wearing the robes of the Dharma kind of symbol of the Dharma

00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:10.800
 in the teachings said that those teaching symbol of the robes

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:13.800
 or the Buddha robes is like honor.

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:16.800
 Even the God's realm, to hear the heaven,

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:20.800
 God's will honor the robes of the Sangha members

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:23.800
 or the shredded robes of the Sangha members

00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:28.800
 because it symbolizes peace and harmony.

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:32.800
 Peace and harmony respect all the Sangha beings.

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:35.800
 So then we continue to carry on that,

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:40.800
 and then truly we are Sangha members, the object of rafuddhi.

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:42.800
 I take rafuddhi in the Buddha,

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:44.800
 I take rafuddhi in the Sangha,

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:46.800
 I take rafuddhi in the Dharma.

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:48.800
 That's what really teaching said.

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:54.800
 So that is really my talk about Buddha-Dharma-Sangha.

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:58.800
 Again, Buddha-Dharma-Sangha is generally in Buddhism,

00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:02.800
 three object of rafuddhi are Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha.

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:04.800
 In the very young teaching,

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:06.800
 there are also slightly different names,

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:09.800
 sometimes named rafuddhi,

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:11.800
 take rafuddhi in the Lama,

00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:14.800
 take rafuddhi in the deity or yidam,

00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:16.800
 take rafuddhi in the dakinis.

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:19.800
 Those, then I can go tomorrow and talk again,

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:20.800
 all those things.

00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:23.800
 But that is generally Buddhism.

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:32.800
 That is the object of rafuddhi or three jewels in Buddhism.
