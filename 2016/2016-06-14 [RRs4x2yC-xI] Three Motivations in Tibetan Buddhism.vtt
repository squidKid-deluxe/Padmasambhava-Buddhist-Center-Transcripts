00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.410
 Welcome, welcome everyone. Again, I'm going to give a little bit of talk about the teachings on the

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.000
 various sources of the teachings,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.400
 but before that, again, the new ones are important to receive the teachings, to actualize the

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.000
 practices.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 We corrected our motivation. We stand in it. Motivation. What kind of motivation?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.830
 What are we doing? We have so many motivations, actually, so many motivations. At this time, what

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.000
 the teaching highlights,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:41.440
 the teaching pointing out, is a good motivation, beneficial motivation, something that you feel

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.000
 happy,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 others feel so wonderful, nice. That motivation we have to ignite it, glorify it.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 With all that good foundation of the motivation, practicing goes in different directions.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 Even we are thinking that we are doing practicing, but it goes in different directions.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 All is dependent upon us.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 Buddha said, the correct teacher, Buddha said, "I taught the teaching up only to you."

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 Up to you, how you put that, actualize that. That's what Buddha said, again and again.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 This time, that's what it is, is we have our motivation. That is something we leave with strength.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.750
 A motivation, what is that motivation? As you can keep what you hear when you point it out, always

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.000
 in the teaching,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 the joy, the appreciation, that motivation is important.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 First, the joy, the appreciation. We have so many beautiful things surrounded.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 If we neglect that, then we will be in a dark places.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 We have to bring that light, sunlight into heart.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 What is it going to do? It's ourself. Nobody is going to do for us.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 Even they do something, it's not going to pull benefit from that.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 We have to do it. It's our responsibility.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 Bring joy, abundance of joy from heart, discover that.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 Why we have to be chaotic? Why we have to be miserly with that?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 Bring joy, appreciate. It's good for you. It's good for others.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 Bring joy and appreciation. We have so many reasons to be joy.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 As I said so many times, again I highlight that.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 Because with all these foundations, practice won't go far.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 And it's not something really turned differently.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 Therefore, joy and appreciation are important.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 We have every reason to be joy, both samsara level and as well as spiritual dharma levels.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 We are tortured. We are blessed. We are lucky.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 But truly, this we are not making up the story. It's truly, roughly like that.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 Truly, it is. Then this joy is not just enough.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 Now we have to understand the second motivation, which is bodhicam.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 Loving-kindness, compassion, thought for all living beings.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 Not just only ourselves is okay, but we are Mahayana practitioner.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 We are very Ayana practitioner.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 Therefore, we have to think to every sentient beings,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 like global level or more kind of samsara. Six rheums levels.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 We really wish everyone happy, joy, peace,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 remove all suffering and difficult troubles.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 Bring that bodhicam attitude.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 That is, again, so important.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 Without the bodhicata, our practice becomes very, very narrow and small.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 It just becomes kind of small.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 Smaller and smaller, even your practice, it becomes smaller and smaller

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 and won't go too deep, strong. It becomes shallow practice.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 So therefore, have strong bodhicata.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 Again, every great master said it. Everyone said it.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 From the Buddha, all the one up, every practitioner did that.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 Those who we see, those great masters,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 we see those great practitioners, what they did, they did this.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 Joy and appreciation, bodhicata. Follow their put examples.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 We all have to follow their examples.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 They are like role models.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 How they become great practitioners, how they become great master

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 and great enlightenment, because of this joy and bodhicata.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 That is how they started.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 Read their life stories, how they are completely filled with bodhicata.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 Every level is so humble, so simple, down to the earth.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 They are grounded, so beautiful, so practical, so considerable, so sensible.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 That every good college, whatever in human society claims, they all have that.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 Truly, they are humble, simple, intelligent, wise, knowledgeable, very practical.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 That's what it is.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 And together with this Vajrayana teaching, with that, above that motivation,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 always teaches purity motivation, purity motivation.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 Everything is enlightened status, according to the reality level,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 on the true ultimate levels.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 So, we are very practitioner, we are on the path of tracks, in the tracks.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 We are not just going to hang out, or really jump to the ordinary nature,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 exactly as it is, with courage and commitment, without any fears or fearlessness.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 Jump to that, without the intellectual distance, that thing.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 In reality, nature is pure. Everything is enlightened status.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 And the poem is enlightened status, sound is enlightened status,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 and the space of the mind is enlightened, bring up that qualities.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 Bring up that qualities, at least for a while we have practiced and meditated.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 Bring up that. Follow the teaching, as the teaching said.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 And we have empirically these teachings, as that as it is, then truly we are good practitioners.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 We are practicing, we are making difference to ourselves and our destinations.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 So therefore, those motivations are really important, and with those motivations.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 And then, now, I am going to go and get the teachings on this short silence of the various sources.
