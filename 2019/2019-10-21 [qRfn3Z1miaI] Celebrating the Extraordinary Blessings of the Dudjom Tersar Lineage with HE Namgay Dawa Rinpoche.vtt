00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.950
 We have Guru Rinpoche, this bell and doji that he used. We also have the Samya Dora, the smaller

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.650
 version. It's in here. It's the same Dora that I'll give you the present bit. I have the bigger

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.000
 version.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:31.310
 Then we also have the purva that was brought by Guru Rinpoche to Tibet to subdue the demons when

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:36.000
 they had asked him to come and they were building the Samya monastery.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:51.530
 The Samya monastery and the demonic forces were not letting them complete the task, so they invited

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.000
 Guru Rinpoche to come.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:03.900
 We want the purva to subdue them. That's also in the claim of the treasure box here. And then we

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:10.990
 have the Pakinyi Scum. We have a Pakinyi scum. This is the first time most of you will be seen one.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.000
 We have one here.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:33.030
 We also have the Tirmacam that was used by Guru Rinpoche. His Ganglin, his Bhumba, the water glass.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.460
 We also have his bell and doji. We also have the impot that he used, some of the thermos that he

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.000
 wrote with was used from this impot that he had written down in me.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 And this is there. And we have all the visual objects that you can see here. It's also in there.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 That is his ordinary thing.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 And his ceremonial hat that he used to give roundel and many other impot.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 If you all want to give roundel, we can give you a blessing of the Samyara.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 Now we have one purva here also, that was forged by Toji, by Toji Legpa for Guru Rinpoche.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.610
 So there are two types. One we say is a sky metal, as you know what it is. Another one is, perhaps

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.000
 some of you may have never heard of, it's called the Zagim metal.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 So this metal we believe is collected from all the universes that's there.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.250
 And then the metals are collected from those universes that then it was forged by Toji Legpa and

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.000
 offered to Guru Rinpoche.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 So we have that purva here. Zagim, purva can be distinguished by its color, it's brown.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 And perhaps we can also give you the blessing of the Zagim Zambada. Also, that was the belong to

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 Kamuro Samyara.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 So we'll give you a blessing with that.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 So short. This is it. A longer explanation will take about five days.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 So it's short on three.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 This is the Zagim Zambada.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:37.900
 And one thing you observe is it doesn't have some of the filling because it's not needed for such

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.000
 objects as diamonds and all.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:48.250
 So this is what I have heard here. I mean, perhaps some people may think that someone speaks, some

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.000
 other people may say otherwise.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:58.040
 But according to our tradition, when it's of such caliber and things, someone is not needed,

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.000
 because there's nobody who can offer this.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 This is all from the Zagim Zabada.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 I think perhaps we can give you the blessing of all the objects.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 For many of you, then that's feasible, if not, I didn't exercise.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 Thank you.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 So very lucky. Please thank Rumbu Shek.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 Extremely lucky.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 Thank you.
