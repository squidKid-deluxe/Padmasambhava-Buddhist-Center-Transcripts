00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 The teacher is very, very important. In the Buddha's teaching, throw out the teaching.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 In the Mirai teaching, or the beginning of the Buddha's teaching, middle of the Buddha's teaching,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.520
 and end of the Buddha's teaching, very early teaching, everywhere said contract the teacher,

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.000
 qualified teacher.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 Qualified teacher is so important.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 And the teacher is also a translated teacher in Tibet. It's called the Lamas.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 And that is exactly the word from Sanskrit translated.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 The Sanskrit word is gurus, gurus translated as Lamas.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.510
 Sometimes in the Sanskrit language, in the Mahayan teaching, the teacher is also known as virtuous

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:51.000
 friend.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 Friend of virtuous.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 In the Sanskrit, although the whole teaching is translated exactly as it is, the Sanskrit language

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 is called galayan matras.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 It's virtuous friend. So teacher is virtuous friend. That we need this teacher.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 Therefore, qualified teacher is so important.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.530
 Always in the Buddha's teaching said, teacher is so important. However, teacher is, that will

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.000
 affect to you, to you.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 And even use examples. Say, a big company, a company, a company, or together with a jar of course,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 jar of course, jar of course, we become dirty.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 Every company with white or conch shell, we been say cleans, cleans.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 So, teacher is very important for that.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 And so therefore, qualified teacher, that's what the Torah of the teaching said, qualified teacher.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 There's qualified teacher, qualified students.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 Both are qualified, have you got that?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.700
 If you don't have the qualified teacher, in what in the teaching said, that you are jumping from

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:20.120
 the cliffs, already we in the samsara, realize, thinking of the we got something, save heaven,

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.000
 reality, we are jumping to the cliffs.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 So, unqualified, contented, unqualified teacher is jumping from the cliffs.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 Also, accepting unqualified student is like drinking poisons.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 Teacher is drinking poisons.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 Generally, student means disciple means according to Buddha teaching is known as lineage holders.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 Lineage holder of all of you are lineage holder of the Buddha teaching.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:58.050
 One of the Buddha teaching said, souls of every you, but we joined, this is the great master, Sh

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.000
anti, there was teaching, praise.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 Souls of every you and peace is teaching of the Buddha or something.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 And every time we joined.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 And then holder of the teachings, may they remain long life of fame, long lives.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 Not that holder of the teachings, not just one isolated of few groups.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 The all, every one who holds the teaching.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 What is teaching?

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 Teaching is a scripture and a realization.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 Of practicing, know something of the Buddha teaching and practice the meaning of that teaching.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 So, that is known as lineage holders.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 You hold that teaching.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 So, instead, think you become the lineage holder and he will destroy the teaching.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 Said, unqualified student is drinking as poisons.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 Posen.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 So, therefore, qualified student, teacher and qualified students.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 What are extensively determined is the Buddha teaching.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 Teachings, all that.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 Think, talking about the spiritual friend or the virtuous friend.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 If the Buddha is generally called larger level everything, there is four kinds of teachers.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:37.730
 Those are known as Sepulchre teachers, Namakaya teachers, high Bodhisattva teachers, regular only

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.000
 teachers.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 This is what we are talking of the qualified teacher and naughty.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 That is regular teachers, only beings, only teachers, regular purpose teachers.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 What is regular teacher?

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 What the great master Buddha said and that was summarized by the great master.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 You all heard his name and me to include me.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 I heard the name known as the great master, Maitriya.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 Maitriya that was going to come to future Buddha.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 And Maitriya is teaching that which is bought by great master.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:25.450
 Master has come to this human world and he bought five tricks or five different teachings of the M

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:26.000
aitriya.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 And one of those got Sutra Alankara, the ornament of the Sutra.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 That means all the condensative meaning of the Sutras.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 Meaning of Sutras.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:53.600
 In that teaching, say the qualified, basic qualified teacher of the Mahayana, also the Mahayana too

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:54.000
.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 There is ten qualifications of that teacher.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 So I will list those ten and then go and let me know all of each of them.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 And the fourth is, how that says, gentle.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 The first is gentle.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 The second is peaceful and very peaceful.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
 And better understanding.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 The fourth is better understanding.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 Better understanding.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 And joyful effort.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 And reach of the knowledges.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 Reach of the knowledges.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 And a realization of them.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 Something realizations.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 Realization of them.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 And excellent or good presenters.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 One who presents to teach, good presenters.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 Good presenters.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 And then compassion.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 And then not tired or bored.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 That means more patience.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000
 More patience.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 So I think, I believe there is ten.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 So that is ten.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 Qualification of the good qualified teacher.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
 Fourth is what?

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 Gentle needs, the one who has good understanding or good maintaining of the good conduct,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
 is not become wild conduct.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 Very gentle. Gentle maintaining very good moralities.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 That is truth.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
 And the second is peaceful.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 Mind is peaceful with mindfulness and alertness.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 Some good, some relief of the concentrations.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 Second. And very peaceful means, again, some relief of the realization of the westerns.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
 So that means what in Buddhism we call?

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
 There is three extra oldage trainings.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 Trainings, morality, concentration and the westerns.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 Some realizations at that point.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 Some different realizations.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 So that means.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 Then, next one is better understanding.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 We need a little better understanding than the students.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 That, not only lower than the student, but better understanding of the word subject.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 All better understanding of the teaching.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 And then, always have some effort to help to the teaching, to help to the others.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 And then, next one is understanding of the, more understanding of the teachings.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 Such as Vinaya teaching, Abhidharma teaching, Suttara teaching.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:27.000
 Already have the reach of the, reach of the knowledges.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 Knowledges.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 And then, not just only talking that, but some really practicing.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 So some realizations, some understanding, some realizations.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 And then also, when presenting the teaching, also presenting the teaching,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 according to the situation, circumstances and the order, desire of the students or the audience.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 Present that quite nicely.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
 And so, good presenters.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:10.000
 And the next one is, then, and have compassion.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:18.000
 Compassion, all the body, to the old, every, all the beings, all some duty of compassion.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
 And allowing kindness, all the body is.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 There is all that.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 There will be that.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 There will be that.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 There will be that.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000
 There will be that.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 There will be that.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000
 There will be that.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
 And then, to be happy to the other beings, not for the teaching, to teach again and again,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 or whatever, explaining those, not bored and tired in some patients.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 And how many times it comes?

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000
 Ten.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 Ten.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 So that is known as qualification of the teaching.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
 Good qualification of the teaching.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:58.000
 Generally, as I said, only the teacher is not something that we can find, but the teacher.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 But the teacher, but the teacher considering...
