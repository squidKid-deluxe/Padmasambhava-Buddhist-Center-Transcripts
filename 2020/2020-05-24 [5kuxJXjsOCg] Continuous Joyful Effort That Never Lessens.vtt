00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.760
 Thank you. Thank you again everyone. Thank you so much everyone. Welcome everyone. Okay.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:23.440
 Then we're going to talk to you about parameter or what we're going to talk about by teaching

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:34.480
 of the Chaiti Vinya Rinpoche and the layout of the three novelists, the beginning novel

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:40.800
 and the middle novel and the complicated novel. And in that way, now we are in the middle novel,

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.840
 as you already know. And in the middle novel, there also is a name that we use the frame

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:54.800
 as like actualizing the body jata and then actualizing the body jata is the sixth parameter

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:02.080
 practices. So we are now on computer, we are talking on the sixth parameter teachings,

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:08.560
 sixth parameter teachings. And now it is the sixth parameter teachings and now we went through the

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:20.400
 first three and which is the generous parameter and patient, so morality parameter and patient

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:31.600
 parameters. So we went through all those three parameter practices, three parameter practice we

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:41.360
 were. And today we talk, continue to talk on the joyful effort parameters. Joyful effort parameter

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.360
 is again, this is so important. Of course, all parameters are so important, so practical,

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:56.240
 they're so appealing and also so kind of systematic that is building up one, up another because

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:03.920
 they're getting what we're doing, we're going to glorify our observations, obstacles and fulfilling

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:10.880
 our wishes of one's own self and others. So therefore, it is really old and so kind of just

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:19.040
 according our capabilities and readiness, it is what the gracious teacher, Buddha Shakyamani

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:26.080
 taught. And this way, now again to follow with this, again as we so many times we mention it,

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.040
 always we mention it and that's what in the teaching always said, so this stands in our

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:39.440
 beautiful motivations. Motivation again, joy and appreciations, joy and appreciation,

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:47.270
 vastness, motivation of the body jata and purity, motivation of other teachings of brain

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:48.160
 realization

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:55.120
 of the Vediana teachings. Those are known as the motivations, but this motivation is not just a

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.160
 kind of motivation or thinking that those intentions are just short, wide, then we're

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:06.640
 going to do some practices. That this motivation is never, is really the practice, that is what

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:14.240
 we're going to practice. That is more performed, more deepening of that motivation. That is what

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:19.840
 we're going to practice. So therefore, we should not think the motivation is kind of just a kind

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:27.920
 of a small kind of like at the beginning stages. No, it is the beginning, but same time is the

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:34.320
 center of the column of the practices. When we fulfill this goal of the motivation,

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:40.400
 then we reach enlightenment, we become the Buddha. So therefore, this is so important.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:47.040
 With those who do motivation and thought, now we're going to follow with the teachings. And today,

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:54.960
 I'm going to talk really again about the joyful effort. Joyful effort or the breath of parliament.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:03.600
 And then also I'm going to talk really about the Saladhava, because now today begins Saladhava,

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:12.320
 the month of the Saladhava, which goes for about a month, or generally. So I'll talk really about

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:20.080
 that. Of course, many of you already know that, but just again, to in a way to glorify our memories

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.080
.

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:28.800
 And because of the kindness, compassion, the wisdom that is shared by our gracious kindness

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:36.960
 teachers. So therefore, all those reasons, I will go over those things. So first, I'll talk again

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:48.160
 really about the joyful effort parliament. Joyful effort, and again, we translate more precisely

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:54.880
 what the great master Shanti Deva said in his way in the guide to the bodhisattvas.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:06.480
 Joyful effort or effort in Burya, one is joy of the virtues. Joy of the virtues. It's not just joy

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:17.200
 of anything. Joy of the dharma, or simply to tell, joy of the dharma. That is essence, essence or

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:25.440
 identity, nature of the joyful effort. I'm translating really kind of joyful effort.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:32.320
 It is joyful effort, but joyful effort of the dharma, dharma, that is really the joyful effort.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:40.960
 So now we go to the joyful effort of dharma, dharma, practices. And that is, then as we,

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:48.480
 I spoke yesterday, and you all know that without the joyful effort, there is no progress of the

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:56.160
 parameters. It's absolutely dependent upon the joyful, of the joyful effort of the dharma.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:05.760
 It's all dependent and to progress of this. This joyful effort of the dharma is, or the virtues,

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:14.320
 is the moving force of the old parameters. So therefore, as I said yesterday too,

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:21.600
 in the quotation of the great Maha of Buddha sitting, Lord Jamsu Sutras, those individually

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:31.280
 who don't have the joyful effort, they cannot fulfill the goal of the others or one's own song.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:41.280
 And then as well as they won't improve the, or practice, practice of dharma. And then therefore,

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:49.680
 they will not reach enlightenment. They were not going to scour there in a Buddha nature.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:55.520
 So that means, when we don't have the joyful effort of the virtues, we don't have the

00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:02.640
 generosity, we don't have the morality, we don't have the patience, we don't have the concentration

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:02.640
.

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:08.240
 And then even when we have versus them, it's completely become dull, dull, dim, you know,

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:14.960
 most kind of light has nothing kind of brightness, clarity is believed, it's really gone. And then

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:22.240
 joyful effort is lost. So therefore, it is so powerful, so important. And opposite of joyful

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:28.240
 effort, as I said yesterday on the teaching, I mean that of course, we all know it's not something,

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:33.760
 again, I'm talking something new things, but the greatest teacher, Buddha Shakti Amuni,

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:40.480
 more clarified that, so that we can understand. That's what, that's what the greatest teacher,

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:47.200
 Buddha Shakti Amuni said himself, he said, "I am the teacher, I'm showing only the way things are,

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:56.000
 as simple, true as it is, nothing higher, nothing below, simple, true as it is."

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:04.640
 So Buddha pointing us out, pointing us out of the exactly way things. So what is really the

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:14.880
 realm of not having joyful effort of dharma? Because of laziness. Laziness, laziness is

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:21.280
 the opposite of joyful effort. And laziness is part of the package of the samsara dualities.

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:29.840
 Samsara, this habit awareness or samsara, this calm, it's just a kind of package. It comes almost,

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:39.360
 it's like shadow, shadow. So now we have to reverse that. We have to check out that will

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:47.760
 or that burden of the, that laziness. And then laziness are, many of times, of course, we think

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:59.680
 laziness is just, of course, laziness, slow, slow, slow, slow for you. Or just laziness, laziness.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:06.880
 That's true. That's the laziness too. The greatest teacher, Buddha Shakti Amuni pointed,

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:14.240
 three laziness, three kinds of laziness. As listed yesterday, and again, this is first is

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:25.840
 the like slow, slow, slow for right. A slow laziness or a simple, maybe I just said,

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:34.320
 the karyam, slow for laziness. And the second laziness is self-blaming laziness.

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:47.840
 Self-blaming. And the third is laziness of the hanging, always hanging with the old habit patterns,

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:58.960
 activity of the old habit patterns. Hang on, hang on that. So those are the three laziness, which

00:09:58.960 --> 00:09:59.600
 is

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:11.760
 preventing our joy of the, joyful effort of the Dharma. It's block, blockings. And so therefore,

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:21.040
 these three are. Now I will go one, one after another, go over there. First is slow laziness,

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:30.800
 or slow, slow laziness, and/or casual laziness. That is very normal. And of course, we all know

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:37.680
 that laziness kind of like, when people are not motivated anything, anything, and they just kind

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:45.680
 of hang up, hang out kind of more, western times in a way. Or maybe like just hang out very

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:53.120
 casually and not motivating and sleeping loud or sleeping late, stay long in the night time,

00:10:53.120 --> 00:11:03.120
 time, and not doing anything. Anything that follows. Goal. Goal, and it's just as casual.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:13.200
 That is known as, you know, Bhadana, is laziness. Not just also in the Dharma, but also in Samsara

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:20.720
 too. And we really do that all the time. What? You're going to fulfill. What do you already have?

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:28.560
 Because of doing that, it will demolish, decline. It will bring declines. And you won't progress

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:35.920
 anything. Anything. It really will decline. So for that reason, what in the teaching said.

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:45.200
 And also time is not going to wait. Wait. Season is going to change. Change. The storm is coming

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:56.160
 in a way. What a great master Patamba Sanyam said. He said, "In the middle of the jungle,

00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:04.800
 the monkeys are very happy. But watch out. The end of the jungle is surrounded by the fires.

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:15.040
 True. In this samsara, we are not really completely safe. So many difficulties are waiting.

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:20.640
 We went through the challenges of the birth, according to Buddhism. We went already.

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:29.040
 Now we go to challenge of the getting old, or sicknesses, death. And the plan, there are so many

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:37.760
 more. Even in certain countries, we have confidence this is going to help to stay lonely and well.

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:44.480
 And all that. Even that support, what we believe to be supported in our lives,

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:53.760
 could turn completely against us. A season, time, everything is changing. Therefore,

00:12:53.760 --> 00:13:05.680
 there is no time. There are so many opportunities with the sloppy laziness. For that reason,

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:15.040
 what a great master Chantideva said, "Don't be laziness. Take as like a timid person."

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:24.480
 Snake enters in the timid life of the timid person. Snake enters. What that timid person is going

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:24.800
 to do?

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:32.960
 Going to wait. What the snake is doing? Know that immediately he will jump up and try to avoid it.

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:43.520
 Similarly, the sloppy laziness is like invading our fulfillment, our growth, our progress.

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:53.040
 For that reason, same way, same kind of metaphor, by an origin or two, and a letter to my friends.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:14:04.720
 What is this teaching said? I said, "As cat and fire on our head, our head cat and fire,

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:09.920
 what do we do? We're not going to wait to see how the fire is going through.

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:20.880
 Immediately we're going to act to stop the fire." Similarly, this sloppy this laziness is like

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:29.230
 can't fire. It's very sneaky fire. It's demolishing our daily practices or the progress, and

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:30.240
 therefore,

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:38.800
 in the teaching said, said, "Two practices. Time is right with you. Everything is your

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:49.280
 favor. Why we shall be not yours? This is the time. Don't make that you feel bad or I've missed

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:55.920
 this opportunity. I've missed the times." When we started thinking that, maybe it's too late.

00:14:55.920 --> 00:15:03.200
 We have to develop and progress right now. For that reason, the force will join for effort.

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:11.120
 What is called the armor-led joyful effort. That we should have. Armor-led joyful,

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:19.920
 courage and commitment, confidence. All the Buddha's bodhisattva, they all reach enlightenment.

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:26.880
 They walked very hard. This really did. And to further each goal of the paramatas,

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:36.560
 they walked hard. They benefited too many beings, one after another. And why I should waste time,

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:43.440
 and why I do that. And we all have these opportunities. It is time that I'm going to

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:51.040
 fulfill the goal. Kind of bounce back our courage and commitment and confidence. Put that in action

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:51.040
.

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:59.360
 Perform it as you receive the teachings, or as you already practiced. This is the time. And really

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:06.880
 feel happy, as we continue doing that. Feel happy. I'm doing something good to perform my goal and

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:13.360
 goal of others. This is the bodhisattva activities. Bodhisattva means we're taking for all the

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:13.760
 beings

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:22.800
 to benefit to everyone. Every act is sloppy. We're not going to fulfill the goal.

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:27.760
 What we say, we're going to fulfill the goal of the others and going to follow,

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:32.800
 put the steps of the Buddha in the bodhisattva. All that becomes just a talk.

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:40.480
 There's no value behind. That's it. We're really losing the point. And therefore,

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:46.640
 we courage, for those reasons, many times in the teaching, teaching those practicing

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:56.480
 lineage teachings, glad dribble of bone in heart. Bone. B-O-N-E, I think. Bone in heart.

00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:04.880
 May I please bless me that I have bone in my heart. We're always trying to go a kind of easy way,

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:09.920
 and trying to avoid that or something. We think, maybe we are smarter. But really,

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:16.080
 reality, we're really banging our own fists to our own head. We're cheating ourselves.

00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:22.400
 Therefore, take the opportunity. We should all do that. I'm not just saying to you,

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:28.800
 also talk to me. I'm reminded. We all need that. And we like to progress and develop.

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:38.720
 Time is right with us. With you, with me, we all have the time now. Good time. Whatever. It is

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:50.160
 perfect. What great teacher, in one of his teachings, the time is perfect now. Otherwise,

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:58.160
 our intelligence will be going to dream. Dream as the edge goes. Our dream, the old

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:05.200
 name, the senses have become also kind of blurry. Blurry. And life force becomes declines.

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:16.320
 And also, they practice. Even if you want to practice, we can't handle. Even our hearts are there,

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:21.200
 but our physical energy level, we won't be able to do many times.

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:29.600
 Times. Therefore, now we should not make so many excuses, these and that thing. And we really let

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:34.960
 you do whatever you committed or whatever we committed. And what we do like to do, practice

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:44.960
 one hour, two hours, trying to maintain that, keep that, not reduce, maybe increase, increase that.

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:51.840
 All different kind of reasons we can make these and that, these and that things. It's true. We have

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:59.840
 all that. But what the great master will keep us hit. The activity of samsara is never going to

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:08.480
 finish it. How is it going to finish it? When you stop, then it's finished. Otherwise, it goes on

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:15.440
 and on. And some other teachings, what he says is, the activity of samsara is like ripples of the

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:26.240
 ocean or ripples of legs. L-A-K-E, legs. There is no end of the ripples. It will continue.

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:36.640
 So therefore, be smart, be wise, be intelligent, be thoughtful, thoughtful, purpose of ourself

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:44.960
 and all the beings. Do something good. We are going to follow our goal. We are taking the beautiful

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:52.000
 meaning of our spiritual lives. That's what the teaching said. It's really true. We stay with

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:59.760
 happy. We lead this world with happy. Our journey will be bright and happy and strongly according

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:06.880
 to the teaching of the great teachers, Bhadashakamuni and as well as all great masters. So that is

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:15.470
 really about the first one. First one, which means sloppy laziness, I'm translating, or just a

00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:16.160
 simple

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:27.200
 laziness, regal, kaju, laziness. Then the second laziness is self-blaming. Many times, we don't

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:36.640
 think that is laziness. But it is form of laziness. Because why? It is preventing our practice,

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:46.640
 our good deeds, our good motivations. It completely blocking our more intentions.

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:56.800
 And it's kind of an easy, easy kind of exit to avoiding that situation for short times.

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:08.080
 Reality again, the same example. We are beating our heart, this priest to our own head. It's

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:08.560
 nothing

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:17.440
 really is any better than that. Just really that self-blaming. We tell how I can do. That's too

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:18.160
 much

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:26.080
 for me. I don't have that capabilities. I'm not walked wise. I'm not strong enough. All this.

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:36.960
 And I can't handle. And how I can handle? Making all those questions and making kind of

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:44.080
 executes or to stay. But that is from what, from what? Let me do that. What is it, from what?

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:53.760
 According to Buddhism, every living being has the capability to reach enlightenment. According to

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:57.920
 Gregor teacher, Buddha Hehakem the teaching is you don't know, it's like demo practice.

00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:05.280
 Everyone has a right. Everyone has a right. Right. Same opportunities.

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:13.040
 Opportunities. Those who become like as the Buddha and those who are still hanging

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:20.320
 or struggling in the samsara, we have the same natures. Gregor teacher, Buddha Hehakem said,

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:32.000
 even the insect will get enlightenment. Insect. We're not insect. We're not flies.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:40.400
 We're more than that. We have all this eighth knowledge of the previous human bodies

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:47.360
 or 18 endowments. We're more than that. We're very important. We're very lucky.

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:55.120
 We have every tools of skills and we are in upper, one of the upper three rooms,

00:22:55.120 --> 00:23:02.960
 rooms. Particularly, human realm is in the teaching. It's the best where you can progress,

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:09.440
 develop. Even we take God's realm, all those so committed, true, but to develop,

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:19.360
 to spiritual realization, it begins from the human realm. It's the perfect best right.

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:27.200
 And we are in that time. We are ever used to terminology normally in America. We are land

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:35.360
 of the dreams. Truth. We can fulfill our dreams. Everyone has a right to fulfill their dreams of

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:45.840
 the enlightenment. No one is excluded. So we should not say, I cannot. What do you make in the

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:46.080
 world?

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:54.240
 Only what we do, we have to have the comment, call it. As armor, length, joyful effort.

00:23:54.240 --> 00:24:03.200
 Put and put then action. And what like action as it after the second joyful effort,

00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:11.840
 which is the never missed activity, continuation as a given effort. Of course,

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:17.280
 you can look those more in the books and I'm not sure many of you already know those things,

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:22.240
 but to clarify, I'm to clarify that, but that's what I'm translating. In the debate,

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:32.000
 you're wrong going away. It's the continuation activity that never missed. Always in progress,

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:42.640
 always lifting up the levels from three to one, sorry, or three to four, four to five, gradually

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:52.240
 lifting up, not going backward, lifting up the our responsibility and our goal, goal, always.

00:24:52.240 --> 00:25:00.480
 And then F is not lifting up immediately, level up immediately, but definitely have to keep

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:09.440
 on that steady mood, where you are or where we are, and that steady mood, and the mood.

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:16.960
 With always a spray and both each other and pray that my capability, my joyful effort,

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:22.400
 that continual growth, joyful effort to the downward, continual growth in the deepening,

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:29.920
 so that I can perform goal of the enlightenment. As Greg Strieger, Bodakshaktaman did, and as

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:37.200
 Manjushri is doing, and as all these others are doing, really, may I ever do it? We all have the

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:46.800
 same opportunities, same nature, same capabilities, same capabilities. I just said, like, what is

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:47.200
 my

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:54.480
 liking? It's my joyful effort. Dharma is liking. That's what I'm struggling with in the samsara.

00:25:54.480 --> 00:26:02.800
 But now I have to put, put, and with that attitude, really that, and then slowly become steady and

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:11.440
 move, and then to move forward, what the great master, Master Chanti Deva said, you always use

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:20.080
 four powers that will accelerate joyful effort. Those four powers, also in the Tibetan city,

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:27.760
 pongji, pongji, and I'm translating it four powers, and which is, the four powers are

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:37.040
 power of the motivation, power of the stabilizations, and the power of the,

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:53.680
 power of the joy, and power of the balance. Those four are the, as part of the tool of

00:26:53.680 --> 00:27:01.520
 continuation joyful effort that is not going to stop. That, for this motivation, again,

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:12.160
 made always feel happy to the practices. Happy. Practice Dharma is the happiness. It is really

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:21.840
 peace. It's joy. It's loving kindness. It was compassion. We opened our own trade of the heart

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:28.640
 that which has crossed us over a long time, for the big less times. Now we're opening that. How

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:35.840
 wonderful. It's something that I can share that with others. How beautiful. Really, feel happy in

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:44.640
 joy. Joy, practice Dharma, practice six powers. So wonderful. So beautiful. How I can do this?

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:54.560
 I can share. I can glorify. I can be strong. I can be continuous. I can be more calm and peaceful.

00:27:54.560 --> 00:28:02.160
 I can understand clearly everything as perfectly beautiful. How wonderful. Never got that situation

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:07.680
 and never realized that. Even everything is with me, but I didn't realize that until now.

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:15.520
 Thanks to them and both themselves, all lineage masters who showing me this, this very part and

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:22.880
 great techniques, that at least all in my tools, now I can see, now I can feel, now I will do.

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:32.320
 Have that attitude, really thought with joy. And then second is power of the stabilizer,

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:40.400
 stable. That means confidence. Power of the confidence. And I'm going to dream. I'm going

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:48.080
 to move. I'm going to fulfill the goal. I'm going to fulfill the goal to discover my own nature,

00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:53.520
 brother nature. And I'm going to benefit for the others. I'm going to fulfill the six power of

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:53.840
 others.

00:28:53.840 --> 00:29:04.400
 Really relying on our own substeams, substeams, your qualities, your glorious goodness.

00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:14.320
 Not going to dream my qualities. I'm not going to reduce my dignities. I'm going to glorify.

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:23.440
 I have brother nature. It's growing. It's brightening up. I'm going to do.

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:34.720
 Really relying on our own, on the nature and with confidence and joy. That is known as power of the

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:45.920
 stabilizers. You can truly keep happy and joy and strong. Second, the motivation is then again,

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:53.440
 joy. Joy and joy for effort. Of course, already it's joy for effort of the dharma,

00:29:53.440 --> 00:30:00.240
 but bring joy. How wonderful, how beautiful. I'm really going to do this for the sentient beings,

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:06.320
 for my self. It's so wonderful that I'm going to fulfill it. And I'm doing this. I'm riding the

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:12.240
 horse of the bodhicitta. Horse of the bodhicitta. I'm going to move from the happiness to the

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:19.760
 happiness. Not just me, but I'm going to lead all other beings along with me. I'm going to

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:26.880
 share this happiness, this peace and this harmonious, this respect and appreciation to all living

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:27.600
 beings.

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:35.040
 How wonderful, how beautiful. Kind of acknowledge ourself when we fulfill it. Not just put those

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:41.400
 fulfillment or what achievement, not put it on the corner, in the dark corner. Bring that on the

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:42.080
 surface.

00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:47.920
 Glorify yourself with help in your, in a way, celebration of the inner qualities, inner

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:58.720
 celebrations. That is known as happiness. Power of the happiness for the joy. And then power the

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:05.520
 balances. When that means, also when we are doing for effort, now it's continuation as like never

00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:10.640
 stop it. But when you are a little bit tired or when you're a little bit kind of like two

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:11.280
 situations

00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:21.040
 become kind of little tense, relax a short time. Calm and peaceful. Relax. Balance. Balance is the

00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:30.960
 one important. Our joy of effort is open, calm, peaceful, balance. The strength of the courage,

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:37.840
 the whether what's called the honor like joy, joy of effort is there. That is we will continue.

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:46.000
 So that is known, those are known as the support of the joy of effort of the continuation.

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:54.800
 Those four powers. What great, which is told by great master, master, chanting devils.

00:31:54.800 --> 00:32:08.400
 Next one is, next one, laziness is, is the laziness of the, a tragic, a tragic old,

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:18.560
 one's own old habit of patience. Old habit of patience. And that is again, a code of Buddhism.

00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:27.040
 It is laziness. Attach one with old, old habit of activities and spend time with that.

00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:36.880
 Spend time. So then what is that? Then it is our practice, our meditation. And what is that?

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:45.120
 Such as your pro-patients maybe. Pro-patients. Or your hobbies. Or watching movie all the times.

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:52.560
 Or watching on the, on the computer, going on the computer games, curtains all the time. Or

00:32:52.560 --> 00:33:00.640
 collecting all the gossips. All the gossips of the village, gossips of the city, gossips of the

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:07.760
 country, or gossips of the world now can get. Kind of promoting that gossips. Gossips.

00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:13.040
 If we do that, what is happening? What is really we're gaining?

00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:19.680
 Nothing is gaining. Nothing is fulfilling. Creating more emotions.

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:25.680
 More different emotions. Emotions, I'm talking negative emotions.

00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:31.600
 Creating more emotional attachment, more anger, more jealous, more arrogance,

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:39.040
 more kind of skeptical. What is really benefiting? And then in the mind stream,

00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:44.960
 our mind becomes more hard and strong and more unhappy. And almost everything becomes

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:54.560
 blowing. See? See? This is, those are all known as, our kind of spending time with so many things

00:33:54.560 --> 00:34:01.120
 just going out. And preventing the activity of even others. Others activity too. Stopping kind

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:12.000
 of slowing down that. And those all known as, leading that is, is, what's called, leading that is,

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:22.880
 all habit activities. Hanging that. This is a wasting time. For that reason, again, be smart,

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:29.920
 be thoughtful. Be thoughtful. Be thoughtful and avoid those. Trying to avoid those and spending

00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:38.000
 more time for the good purposes. Something that really benefit us. Or to others. Or maybe,

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:43.280
 again, another one, maybe this modern time, spending so much time gossiping on the poems,

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:49.440
 or in the mobile poems, or looking all the time on the, on this, this telephones,

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:56.240
 telephones, and just collecting all those kind of unnecessary and formations.

00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:02.780
 And that kind of is also really becoming, it's not good for health, I believe. Every month,

00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:03.040
 actually,

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:07.760
 I heard that it's not good for health. It's completely kind of straight up the mind,

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:13.120
 agitated, and blowing up or mixed up our wind energies. And then it's kind of

00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:18.720
 affect with the brains and the mental state and peace and everything. It has not really

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:26.960
 benefit. According to Dharma, it is the laziness that prevent our progress and the developments.

00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:34.800
 Therefore, be strong. This is the time again. It's time and it's just the perfect situation,

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:44.560
 perfect time with us, and be smart. Be strong. Have bone in our heart. Use the time for the right

00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:50.400
 purposes, good purposes. It didn't mean that we cannot watch, we cannot do or talk or anything

00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:57.600
 like that. But more attention. More kind of simple, more gentle ways. Those are really important.

00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:57.840
 Those

00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:03.280
 are in the teaching. You see, it's the form of laziness. If we do that, what is laziness? That's

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:15.520
 laziness. Then it is, is, oh sorry, next, uh, and then it will prevent it to the third joyful

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:15.760
 effort.

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:26.720
 Part of joyful effort is as joyful effort never feels enough to the good things. We never should

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:33.680
 not feel, oh it's enough. I did enough now. I don't need to do. I don't need to do. I did

00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:39.440
 enough practice. I did enough meditations. Meditation. So I spend the time in all of these

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:45.600
 and then kind of, perfect kind of thing, and then we don't need to do more than that. But according

00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:55.440
 to Dharma teaching, until we reach enlightenment, until we benefit all the beings, our job is not

00:36:55.440 --> 00:37:03.280
 complete. There's nothing is enough. We have to accumulate all the merits. We have to

00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:10.240
 accumulate the merit to the generous practices. We have to accumulate merit from the morality

00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:16.400
 practices, patient, all the six varamana practices. We have to help with all the beings,

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:25.200
 beings. And there's nothing really we can say is enough. It's that might, it's time. We always do,

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:32.160
 even the most, smallest things we should do with this practice. This is the story, again, in the

00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:37.680
 teaching, in the ancient time, or in the 11th century, when the great master, Atisha, came

00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:44.720
 to Tibet. And the teaching said, said, in the teaching said, Atisha, of course, is one of the

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:52.400
 great masters who came to Tibet from India. He's a great enlightened beings, great in them. But yet

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:52.400
,

00:37:52.400 --> 00:38:02.000
 he's always so simple, humble, and practicing so simply. Practicing, such as many times I heard

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:09.680
 all the teachers, teachers you see, he practiced in a giant praise of this taking ruffles. I take

00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:16.640
 ruffles in the Buddha. I take ruffles in the Dharma. I take ruffles in the Sanghas. Those praise,

00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:24.160
 jambro in Tibet, called jambro prayers that he do always. Then he do many times, always actually,

00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:32.160
 always he do, making the chathas, chathas. By himself, he become the one of the great

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:42.550
 masters, and he's so many students. But he himself making chathas, chathas. Some of the students

00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:42.880
 told

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:51.680
 his master, Atisha, "Oh great master, master, we don't like to see you. Your head is dirty with

00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:58.640
 the clays, the clays and the making of the chathas. Let us do that chathas for you." They're told

00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:06.240
 to Atishas. Atishas say to them, "What are you talking? You're going to eat for me too?

00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:13.440
 Eat for me too? What are you talking about? Really?" He said, "That's the examples."

00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:21.760
 At some, we all need even the smallest of things. We're never going to say it's enough, or it's too

00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:31.120
 low, or too simple. That is arrogance. That is ego-clinging. That is the obstacles. It's

00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:39.520
 preventing to accumulate the merits. Therefore, we from the smallest, such as the circumambulation,

00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:46.800
 performing the making of the chathas, serving to the temples, the community houses, with love,

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:55.280
 with kindness, with respect. Those are known as both meditating rituals or dharma activities,

00:39:55.280 --> 00:40:03.120
 and then practice meditating. Do good things, and that really helps. When you finish that,

00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:09.440
 even when you did that, we all feel happy, joy, or just something good. Do with a quarter of your

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:17.680
 cup of lettuce, and also need more others, but we did coordinate with confidence, and always

00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:18.320
 wishing

00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:25.840
 we can do more things. Each time, whatever we're able to do, ever we did, we should dedicate that

00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:34.320
 very whole living beings. They refer to their realizations. That is my really talk about

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:44.080
 the joyful effort of the dharma. Dharma talk, and I spoke really about the three latheiness,

00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:49.920
 and then as well as three joyful efforts. Those are divisions of three joyful efforts.

00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:59.120
 That is my brief talk, and now I'm going through really about the sagadawa. Sagadawa is really

00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:09.520
 so powerful, a cori, buddhist, and genuinely Tibetan buddhist. Why I'm saying that? Because

00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:17.920
 Theravada sagadawa and the Tibetan Buddhism sagadawa is slightly different. Why? Because Theravada

00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:25.760
 sagadawa happened last month. Last month. So it's one month difference. On the other hand, maybe 15

00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:32.080
 days different. Different. So for that reason, I'm talking this particular, what we call the

00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:38.480
 intubated world sagadawa, and which is, I think, in the Sanskrit, they wear saka. I think so.

00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:45.520
 Exactly. You can get those things by yourself. It's true. But if this sagadawa is because of why,

00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:52.960
 it's so important. And of course, generally, every time is so important. In the season or situation

00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:52.960
,

00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:59.040
 time is right. If we use that, it has really big powers. For example, if the spring comes,

00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:06.080
 then summer is coming. Therefore, the farmers do the harvest station or planting all the seeds.

00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:14.400
 They cannot, even they like to do winter, they cannot do in those northern atmospheres. They

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:20.560
 cannot do it. They always have wait in the springtime and then start sowing the seeds,

00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:29.200
 blowing the pills and planting the seeds. That means timing is perfect. Similarly, the sagadawa

00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:37.520
 is really perfect timing to accommodate the readiness. According to both master's teachings,

00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:43.280
 everyone, all the schools of Tibetan Buddhism, say the same thing, say the same thing. So it's

00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:50.640
 so powerful, so special. It is like in the teachings, the sagadawa, each virtues or the

00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:56.960
 pose dhamma practices will be multiplied as really millions and a million times or a trillion times

00:42:56.960 --> 00:43:04.320
 in the teaching set. This is not just only the sagadawa term at one time, each time. That means

00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:12.160
 each day, every practice, that virtues are that much increased. That may be that much increased.

00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:19.840
 Very. That means also our negative behaviors are put in mind. The two obscurations are going away.

00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:27.600
 Two obscurations for two. To clear up the two obscurations, how many times the greatest teacher,

00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:34.640
 Buddha Chaitanya Muni spent three countless years to claim it to obscurations.

00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:42.640
 So above obscurations, a pretty pattern is so strong and deep. Whenever you use the powerful

00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:49.440
 method and the skill who means ways, it really makes big change. In the teaching set, what?

00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:56.480
 Buddha Chaitanya Muni, when he was born as like Brahma, Brahma, he circumrelated,

00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:07.360
 "Arboleted to Sanghiya Kargil or Buddha Kargil." Kargil, with one treat, I mean so that means

00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:14.560
 kind of the one treat he put inward, he kind of he's like a certain practices and then

00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:19.760
 with one treat, he circumambulated one week, day and night.

00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:31.280
 That perpetuated karmas, I think of eating, eating karmas, karmas, something,

00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:38.320
 and accumulated that much. So these three countless eons have become shorter of the eating karmas.

00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:45.040
 Like that, I think something like that. So it's so powerful and we use the perfect time.

00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:52.000
 Perfect time. It is really important. So therefore, Saladeva is really the very special, perfect

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:52.480
 time

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:58.720
 according to all the great masters that were Buddhists. So then what happened in Saladeva?

00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:06.720
 Because Saladeva, there is three major activities of the activities of the Buddha Chaitanya Muni

00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:15.680
 happening in this month. The first one is birth. The second is his enlightenment. And third is, is

00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:22.320
 Mahaparin Hiranas. Those are three measures. Plus, according to the teaching,

00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:29.440
 that according to the great master material teaching, among the 12 activities,

00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:36.400
 those 12 activities, you look in your book and all other means of the method, you look

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:41.600
 and I won't list all those things. I think it's going to take time. But one of those

00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:52.000
 is known as walking to the body trees. That is one of the major activities.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:46:00.880
 And one activity is also known as the subduing all the Mahas by his completion, allowing karmas,

00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:10.640
 all the obstacles. So those trees are also happened. Happened. Then in some teachings also

00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:11.120
 mentioned

00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:20.000
 that he told all the nations on that also in this month. That means Buddha Chaitanya Muni

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:28.880
 stayed in the kingdom about 29 years. After that, he left the kingdoms. And when in the jungle,

00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:34.640
 he told all the nations. So that means all the nations, he left in the also maybe kingdom in

00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:41.440
 a saladawah, saladawah in this month, and he told all the nations. That all nation in the teaching

00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:47.920
 said or some teaching said, he told that all the nation on the 8th day of this month.

00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:55.120
 So now all that, all those major activities happened. And now I will say, when Buddha

00:46:55.120 --> 00:47:01.920
 Chaitanya Muni was born, according to the Buddha's name, he was born on the 7th day of the lunar

00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:10.240
 calendars. And the Buddha Chaitanya Muni took all the nations and told the 8th day of the lunar

00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:17.440
 calendar of this, at the day of this month. So 7th day at the day. And when Buddha Chaitanya Muni

00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:25.920
 walked to the Bodhi tree, the full moon or the portent of the lunar calendars, he walked,

00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:35.840
 walked to the Bodhi tree, portent. And then he sat down on the Bodhi tree on the full moon nights.

00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:48.240
 At that full moon nights, he defeated all the vāras by lowing kindness in a compass. That happened

00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:48.240
.

00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:56.080
 And that morning, before the dawn, he treated them. In this world or in India, Buddha become the

00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:56.880
 Buddha

00:47:56.880 --> 00:48:04.800
 in life. That all happened in the full moon nights. Then, Buddha Chaitanya Muni, when he

00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:13.280
 entered Mahāprāri nirvana, in that same full moon night, not the same one, but 82 years after

00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:14.560
 that.

00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:23.200
 No, no, no, sorry, it's 29, 35, Buddha reached enlightenment. And then, Buddha stayed about 45

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:30.800
 years and turned the wheel of dhāna. After that, he entered the Mahāprāri nirvana. And so that

00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:37.520
 means, Buddha entered Mahāprāri nirvana, 45 after that, after that, he'll get enlightenment,

00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:46.480
 but same day of the lunar calendar and full moon. That Buddha entered Mahāprāri nirvana. So

00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:47.600
 therefore,

00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:55.120
 this month is considered a month of the merry choice, month or month of the very virtues.

00:48:55.840 --> 00:49:03.200
 Therefore, many times in the Tibetan, the Tibetan is custom. They always acknowledge it. So what do

00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:09.680
 we have to do? The Buddha's teaching. So try to follow what Buddha says and what Buddha teach.

00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:21.600
 What Buddha did? Buddha did his non-violence. Kindness, compassion, love to all the sentient beings

00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:21.600
,

00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:28.080
 respect to all the sentient beings. That's really what Buddha is, or was, or is.

00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:37.600
 And then what he taught, that that teaching taught, love and kindness, compassion, non-volence,

00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:45.920
 respect and appreciation to every living beings, and bring more harmony and peaceful.

00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:51.760
 That's what really the Buddha taught. Generally, more love and compassion in heart and mind.

00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:59.280
 And in order to increase that, to do medituary activities, activities of the six paramatta

00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:05.040
 practices. So those are what the Buddha taught. And therefore, follow the Buddha,

00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:10.640
 of the Tibetan Buddhism, then they try to do a lot of virtuous activities as much as they can

00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:19.440
 in this month. And so, what really they're doing? Many times they take the uni vowels,

00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:26.400
 uni practices. Uni vowels are the eight preceptors. It's the late practitioners. Most of the time,

00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:34.800
 it is particularly designed, the shortest one preceptors, 24 hours. And that is trying to

00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:42.240
 take that vowels. Or maybe they activated the Apasana vowels. Activated, recently,

00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:49.200
 Pasana vowels. So those are the rituals. And 80%, of course, many of you already know,

00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:56.960
 but even you all know, I will just list those as precise. And those are, there is, if it's 80%,

00:50:56.960 --> 00:51:01.760
 if we divide it according to the teaching, this can be divided into three groups.

00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:12.160
 Root of the vowels, and the reminding of the consciousnesses, and then group of the ascetic

00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:19.840
 practices. Ascetic practices. So group of the root vowels, group of the, group of,

00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:25.520
 there's not many things, but group, yeah, maybe group, group of the, to maintain the

00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:33.680
 consciousness or thought of all, and then group of the ascetic practices. Those are known as the

00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:42.240
 eight preceptors. Now I'll go each of those, their names. First, the root of the vowels is

00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:53.120
 not healing, not stealing, not, I'm talking about the uni practices, not sexual activities.

00:51:54.880 --> 00:52:08.400
 And don't tell me, and not lying. I think I really did that, that again, not so,

00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:21.840
 what's called, not killing, not sexual activities, and then not sexual activities, and not lying.

00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:33.600
 Those three, poor, are the root of the vowels. And it's divided by the root principle, foundation

00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:41.440
 of the vowels. Vowels. And then what the groups of the, of the consciousness, or thoughtful,

00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:50.800
 that is alcohols and drugs, that they include, maybe also we can call it smoking, smoking.

00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:58.240
 Those are vital, because if you do that, it will lose our consciousness. It will undermine

00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:06.160
 our thought force, or symbol to the mindfulness. It will disturb the mindfulness, alertness,

00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:12.960
 and consciousness. Therefore, we prevent, we take the vow, not going to do that,

00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:22.880
 period of what we take the vowels, such as 24 hours. So that makes five, five. Now their group

00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:33.760
 of the ascetic practices, that is not eating the food afternoon, not eating the afternoon,

00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:46.560
 and not staying on the high throne, or high bed, or expressive beds. Beds. And that is one group.

00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:55.200
 And the second group of that ascetic practice, not singing, not dancing, and not performing.

00:53:57.680 --> 00:54:04.160
 And that is second group. Third, second group of the ascetic practice. Third group of the ascetic

00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:13.760
 practice is not wearing the only ornaments. Ornaments. Not necklace, short necklace,

00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:21.680
 long, medium necklace, and long necklaces. And making up the colors, or colors, or makeup,

00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:32.000
 maybe in other words, makeup. Makeup, those are that group of the not only thing, or not making

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:43.040
 up groups. So all those three are known as ascetic practices. And all together, there is

00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:52.240
 that personas. And then above that, in the tradition of Tibetan, and particularly in the

00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:57.840
 teaching said, is the articha introduced, and not eating the meat. When you eat one meal in a day,

00:54:57.840 --> 00:55:07.520
 or the before noon, you eat, but not eating any animal products. But that means completely

00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:14.800
 vegetarians. So generally, in the Salada, more than 80 babies, and really those practitioners,

00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:22.080
 or the monasteries they do, vegetarians always try to do vegetarians. So I thought that was really

00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:28.480
 good. These days, a vegetarian is so important, and so healthy, everyone is talking. So I think,

00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:35.920
 I thought maybe, I'm going to try to myself too. So for at least two weeks, try to be vegetarian.

00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:43.680
 And I like to also encourage you all, if you can do vegetarian, then it's wonderful. You don't have

00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:51.760
 to be vegan, unless you want, then of course it's good. Otherwise, the vegetarian is really great,

00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:59.600
 great. And then you can take these vows with shrines, yourself. If you don't have any kind of

00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:06.960
 teacher who do it, and if those who really like to do that, send us email, email, we will send you

00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:17.040
 the instructions of that, that taking vows of the, this adult. It's the same as the uni practices.

00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:22.640
 Many of you maybe have those other units. It's just like that. But that's why we do that,

00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:30.240
 let's shine nicely. Nicely. Making shrines nice and a nice atmosphere is really considered also

00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:36.640
 six paramatta practices. We're talking about now six paramatta. So I like to highlight on

00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:43.920
 six paramatta practices. With that, try making shrines perfectly beautiful,

00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:52.000
 eating demand, nice spending time, and also maybe some effort spending, making nice shrines. That

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:59.280
 aspect is, or that space is such as plural, incense, and light offerings, and nice things,

00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:06.640
 kind of clean up that is all known as generous aspect of the shrines, generous practice.

00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:13.920
 You spend time, something, your effort, and your kind of also your some, some to make candles in

00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:20.400
 incense and flow and all that, you spend time. So that aspect is like generously practice. Generous

00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:27.600
 paramatta. Then nice shine, making nice, which are clean, clean, nicely, nice, fresh water,

00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:32.720
 or whatever offerings. Everything kind of looks so nice and beautiful, really like that. It's not

00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:39.120
 just a kind of like the table of yard sales, or the garage sales, but nice and beautiful,

00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:45.360
 really just really do that. That aspect is known as morality of the sharing practices.

00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:52.960
 And of course, I'm sure that takes some time, times and effort, and they kind of like that. But

00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:53.200
 that,

00:57:53.200 --> 00:58:00.960
 when you do that, we do it. That is patient. That is aspect of the patient. We do that,

00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:04.480
 even though he's kind of spending time, there will be all these things left.

00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:11.200
 And then your effort, of course there, because that's what you're doing. That is your effort.

00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:15.600
 And then when you put the offering, those things, if you know the meaning of those different

00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:20.880
 offerings, such as in a Tibetan square, those seven boards, if you think concentrated on those,

00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:25.200
 really thinking on concentrated on that, that is a concentration of paramakas.

00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:31.600
 And that is clearly, beautiful, perfectly, exactly the way it should be. Things are perfectly

00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:39.600
 beautiful, done perfectly, and that is the personal aspect of parama. So this making shrine

00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:45.680
 right there, simply we are accumulating. Parama, the practice is true. It's really

00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:53.120
 beautiful. If we can do that, let me, this activated that in saladawas. That is wonderful,

00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:59.600
 it's beautiful. And then you can take those vowels, like in shrine, shrine, for the essence,

00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:04.960
 and do three pose station, and after three pose station, join those praise, whenever you already

00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:11.440
 know that. And then just throw those praise, and then that means you're breaking vowels right in

00:59:11.440 --> 00:59:18.160
 front of the shrine, and take shrine is the presence of the Buddha. That shrine is like Buddha.

00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:25.120
 And Buddha's mode is the enlightenment beings are right in there, in front of that you're taking

00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:34.480
 that vowels. And then you take that, and in a vowel, in tradition teaching, so you won't eat.

00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:41.360
 If you take eight percent vowels for 24 hours, you won't really, then apparently you won't eat food

00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:41.360
.

00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:47.600
 No, you're not going to speak of communication eating, just spend time, practices, meditating,

00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:53.200
 or do the whole accumulation practice, whatever you're doing, meditating, and reciting all the

00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:59.440
 time into bed, what they do, spending time, finding the matter of the gerizins. Visualizing,

00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:06.160
 gerizin matters, om mani, pemme, om mani, that's a relative. And then I turn next morning. So that

01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:12.560
 is really the 24 hour vowels, and then do the dedication prayers. So that's the shortest vowels

01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:20.560
 of the 24 hours, which according to teaching is so powerful, it's so great for education,

01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:28.000
 and the power of practices. So that's really kind of what I'm told. And now we've completed almost

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:38.720
 time, and my talking time, and then as well as meditating time, all is completed. Now we're right,

01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:45.440
 we'll go to the healing practice, or gi mela, I think. So today, we're going to spend time

01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:53.040
 with the salga dama, and for the aspire that we take these opportunities. So I thought also,

01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:59.600
 I like to do a little bit with this practice myself as much as I can, and particularly those

01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:04.160
 trying to be kind of like vegetarian, and that's what really I'm thinking kind of like.

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:10.480
 And then so, but then also you do, and then union practice, or 24 hours, you can do that,

01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:18.720
 but wonderful. And thank you everyone very much for all your patience, and thank you.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:38.800
 And now we really go to the right to the, what's called the 14 mela practice.
