00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880
 Thank you very much, everyone, for participating. Thank you very much for coming. Thank you very

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.680
 much.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.760
 Thank you very much to everyone. Thank you.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:16.560
 This morning I'm going to offer the transformation of the Ngondro practices, both the short and

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.120
 longer

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:26.720
 work of the five years on the Jyurumaki, or the new lineage. And then, after that, I'm going to go

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:39.280
 over kind of brief summary meaning of the teachings, all those points. Really, I'll go over that,

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:47.520
 just in reminding to all of us, to you and to me, that this is our foundation practices,

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.760
 not just foundation practices, but this is our really central column of practices of the

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:00.400
 every instance we follow in the teaching of the Buddha Dharma, particularly Ngondro teachings.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:07.600
 There are many, definitely generally Ngondros in the teaching, but no matter whatever the teacher

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.920
 taught, the essence is the same, meaning is the same, and particularly Ngondro teachings.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.080
 And then, so therefore, this is, we all do this Ngondro practice. This is really foundation,

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:27.360
 this is the central column, and this is our final achievement, this Ngondro practice is.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:34.640
 So that way, Ngondro practice is so important. It's also why it's so important, it's a condensed

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:42.720
 meaning, condensed teaching of the entire Buddha's teaching. As I said yesterday, I mean, you know,

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:50.000
 the Buddha gave for 45 years the teachings. Those teachings are divided, so many groups,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.760
 or nayana teachings. The condensed practice, to put in the practice, the essence of the essence of

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:04.640
 teachings, from all the teachings, from the Theravada or the Khandeghya teaching,

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:11.920
 all the Vedayana teachings, this Ngondro is essence, essence and condensate, so we can easily

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:18.240
 put practices. Otherwise, the Buddha teaching is every, in the teaching said, every teaching,

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:26.240
 every words of the Buddha teaching, is teaching so special. But however, if we like, if we like

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:33.600
 to follow those teachings, it's long, it's big. In the Theravada teaching, there is over a hundred

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.920
 volumes of the only Buddha's teaching. Our lives spend, even we have time, even we have the

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:46.320
 dedication, motivation, commitment, to spend time to read all this. And therefore, like that is,

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:53.440
 it really takes so long, and we can't observe everything unless we are so genius as like

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:59.520
 Great Master Lumchimpa, Great Master Ramana. But then you say this moment you read, and that

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:06.000
 photograph memory, they all understand. But for us, it's very difficult. So therefore,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.520
 they are for great masters. So practice linear, those masters for the condensate. So this is so

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.640
 special. That's the, this is the path. All these enlightenment beings with the daras went,

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.840
 rich enlightenment. And now, people, those practitioners are practicing, and those people

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:31.520
 who will follow to the path, they will practice. So we are one great highway. Now, unmistakably,

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:37.600
 it will lead us to the destination, our goal of the realization by practice of the Mundra. It's

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:45.440
 so, so special. So first, I will give the transmission of this Mundra, this true short one,

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:53.360
 and the longer ones. So as you know, and so now, I will give the transmission. And transmission,

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.520
 of course, we all know, is order transmission, or order lineage, or speak empowerment in one way,

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:05.520
 according to teaching. And so I will be the first and short one I will do.
