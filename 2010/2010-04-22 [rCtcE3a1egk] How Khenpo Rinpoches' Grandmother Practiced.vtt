 "She is so devoted. She likes to practice so much in the village style. No matter what they do,

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:16.320
 they can listen to her. I think that would be more practical. So they all have the animals. So

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.790
 first they will put all the animals in the way that they have to put in the yard or in the grass

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:28.520
 and all that. Then after that, then they will have the practice, even in their family practices."

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.680
 "They have the animals before the dinner and then they have the dinner and then they go to bed.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:42.860
 That's like the village tradition. So our grandmother, the father's mother, said in the village,

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:50.520
 she says, 'Sri Dardana, don't let the family sleep.'

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.510
 She said, 'Sri Dardana, don't let the family sleep.' She said, 'Sri Dardana, don't let the family

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:57.520
 sleep.'

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.520
 She said, 'Sri Dardana, don't let the family sleep.'

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.520
 She said, 'Sri Dardana, don't let the family sleep.'

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.520
 She said, 'Sri Dardana, don't let the family sleep.'

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:23.690
 She said, 'Sri Dardana, don't let the family sleep.' She said, 'Sri Dardana, don't let the family

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.520
 sleep.'

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:38.520
 She said, 'Don't let the family sleep.' She said, 'Sri Dardana, don't let the family sleep.'

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.280
 She said, 'Sri Dardana, don't let the family sleep.' She said, 'Sri Dardana, don't let the family

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.520
 sleep.'

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:55.520
 She said, 'Sri Dardana, don't let the family sleep.' She said, 'Sri Dardana, don't let the family

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.520
 sleep.'

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.890
 She said, 'Sri Dardana, don't let the family sleep.' She said, 'Sri Dardana, don't let the family

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:02.520
 sleep.'

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.840
 She said, 'Sri Dardana, don't let the family sleep.' She said, 'Sri Dardana, don't let the family

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:09.520
 sleep.'

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:18.700
 She said, 'Sri Dardana, don't let the family sleep.' She said, 'Sri Dardana, don't let the family

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:19.520
 sleep.'

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.520
 She said, 'Sri Dardana, don't let the family sleep.' She said, 'Sri Dardana, don't let the family

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.520
 sleep.'

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:29.620
 In the Tara press, there is the benefit of the press, the 21 words. It is said, I think, 'Buddha

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.520
 said two times, three times, or the seven times.'

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.840
 She said, 'So if we are trying to do at least two times, or three times, that they do that. Oh,

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:40.520
 that's one time.'

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.520
 Okay. Thank you.
