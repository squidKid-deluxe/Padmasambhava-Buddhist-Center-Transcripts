Among these, in the Vajrayana, connecting to your teacher is essential to invoke the power and beauty of the nature of mind. Therefore Guru Rinpoche gave many teachings on how to practice on Guru Padmasambhava, many of which were hidden by the wisdom dakini Yeshe Tsogyal.\n\nThis particular terma was revealed by the famous terton Tsasum Lingpa in the 17th century, and is considered one of the blessed and powerful practices for connecting to Guru Rinpoche as a sambhogakaya emanation known as Guru Vidyadhara. This terma is a condensed practice of all three Inner Tantras of Mahayoga, Anuyoga, and Atiyoga.\n\nThe Dzogchen teachings are the highest and most direct teachings of the Buddha Shakyamuni on the nature of mind. They show us how to discover our own inner beauty and realize everlasting peace for ourselves and all beings. Ven. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche will give these rare and essential heart instructions according to the great master Shechen Gyaltsab Gyurme Pema Namgyal Rinpoche. These direct and profound teachings impart the critical points and central supports for all practitioners to maintain to keep our practice fresh, alive, and beneficial for everyone.\n\n\u201cIn brief, to recognize your own nature is the view.\nWhen you abide within it, that is the meditation.\nAnd if you have no attachment, that is superior conduct.\nWhen you arrive at the primordially free fundamental nature, that is described as the fruition.\nAll are included in the natural state beyond concepts.\u201d\n\nShechen Gyaltsab Gyurme Pema Namgyal Rinpoche (1871-1926) was the reincarnation of Orgyen Rangjung Dorje, and was the fourth regent of Shechen Monastery. Shechen Gyaltsab was the disciple and heart-son of Mipham Rinpoche. He also studied closely with the First Great Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo and the First Great Jamgon Kongtrul Rinpoche, among many other extraordinary Nyingma and Sarma masters. He focused for many decades on the key points of Creation and Completion Stage practices. Shechen Gyaltsab excelled in all three activities of the learned--exposition, debate, and composition--undertaking the three practices of listening, reflecting and meditating for his own benefit, and the three activities of teaching, debating and writing for the benefit of others.\n\nVen. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche is a holder of the complete Buddhist Nyingma lineage of study and practice. He was enthroned by H.H. Dudjom Rinpoche as a Nyingma Abbot. As an accomplished scholar and Vajrayana master, Rinpoche has an amazing ability to convey profound topics simply and directly, making the rich, vast ocean of Dharma accessible and easy to put into practice.\n\nwww.padmasambhava.org\nwww.pbdc.net",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.300
 When you have the realization of the mind as a living Buddha, your mind becomes as a really true

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:19.880
 Buddha, if you have realization in the teachings, don't stop, don't stop the contracting to the

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.000
 teacher, don't give up the teachers.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:35.780
 Even all phenomena are, you realize that all phenomena are mind, truly when you realize that nature

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:49.000
, but even should not mix up karma and lower karmas, very careful, every activity, every activity.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:59.730
 And even you become the embodiment of your sorrows, embodiment of three kayas, or bullas, kayas,

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:06.000
 but also should not give up the honor and the Buddha dharma sorrows.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.480
 So even you have to realize that, that's what all these great masters, when they got realization in

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:18.000
 such a really big, but still they're so humble, so simple, don't to the earth.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:26.060
 This is one of the guys, nothing acting like something big, anything, he's really so don't to the

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.000
 earth.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.240
 Even you have the realization of it, you see everything so clearly, the omniscient, all the clear

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.000
 voices, all these things.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 And don't have the arrogance, don't fill up some spirituals, keep yet calm and peaceful.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 Those are the mermaids, somebody teaching that he taught, he taught the teachings.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.330
 So always, the karmas have to be very thoughtful, and they have to generally, externally, for

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:06.000
 example, in post meditation karmas, there's karmas with careful mindfulness, and karmas with them,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 karmas.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.790
 Yeah, I think we just will talk conduct of the mindfulness, so always be mindful, always thoughtful

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:15.000
.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.280
 I know in the teaching said, even you have the highest realization, biggest realization, but

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:30.310
 conduct level came, should be very simple, in a detail, and thoughtful, very powerful, very

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.000
 practical.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.870
 That is for example, Buddha Shakyamuni, great teacher, is Buddha, but in externals, when we read

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:49.770
 the books and the teachings, so thoughtful, so practical, and so sensible, so cooperative, and so

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:56.000
 appealing, and acceptance, not saying I'm Buddha or this and that.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.870
 So accepted, even Buddha gave the teachings and not be kind of talking all the time, he'd make

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.000
 dialogues.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:13.540
 And I always said, oh, some student, Charlie Potter, or Mongol Potter, or Maha Subhuti, say, and

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.390
 the real Buddha said something like that, and she said that this, the students, or great teacher, I

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.000
 don't know that way.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.440
 Then Buddha answered, oh yeah, that's true. This is not right, this is. He opened the dialogues. It

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:35.000
's not ordering. Ordering. Buddha is so humble, simple.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:43.990
 And that's really the example. Gentle, peaceful, cooperative, local, that's a BS, regular, average

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:53.300
 person. But the insight, realization, is then vastness. Love is vastness, compassion is vastness,

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.000
 wisdom is vastness.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:03.910
 That's what we really need. And so that, thoughtful, mindfulness, alertness, all those are

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.000
 important.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:12.130
 And respect the old teachings of Buddha, Buddha by Maha Subhuti, following their footsteps, and the

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:19.350
 benefit of all the beings according, our cover, your cover-billing, and cover-billing, or reading

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.000
 as well as others.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:32.350
 Those all conduct and keep the practices. And also keep the practice as government. We met as

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.000
 government. They keep, keep.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:47.460
 And many times, many asanga members, many times, I will never let you down. It's a wonderful

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:48.000
 statement. Really, that's what we should do.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:57.350
 Never let down Buddha. Never let down Dharma. And never let down Sanghas. Keep in the heart. And

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.000
 never let down our bodhicam.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:08.880
 That is really, then, wonderful. Really, that is awesome, actually. But we're going to act as also

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.000
 humble, simple.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 That is truly, really, according to the teaching of the Buddha and these great Masters. So I will

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 stop here for a minute.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 [silence]
