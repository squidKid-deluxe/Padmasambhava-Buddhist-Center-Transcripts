00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.640
 Thank you, everyone. Again, thank you. Welcome, everyone. Welcome. Welcome. Thank you again.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:16.640
 So I'll just talk really about, again, it is reminding of our practice in meditation, of course,

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:17.260
 everything.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:23.520
 Oh, that's what we went through last month, or last time, last time, until today.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:30.840
 But we already know that. So today, again, I told you what we've been talking about last time.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:38.800
 It is about the Ibeyo-para-aramata, all the concentrators, and among the six paramatas, it is the

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.080
 fifth paramatas.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:48.280
 Again, we lay out and divided into three groups, the beginning group, noble, in the middle noble,

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.080
 and the kungkuluri noble.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:56.370
 And every time, when we started to practice this, to reflect on the teaching, always in the

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.320
 teaching, say, the correct motivations,

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:06.240
 that means that we have also got incorrect motivations. Many times, we do. Incorrect.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:13.750
 But we do listen and reflect the practice of teaching with incorrect motivation, then it will

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.440
 become deluded, deluded.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:24.440
 Many times, in the teaching, he said, if you don't do the practice as dharma, then dharma will

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.400
 become almost opposite of that.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.200
 How does that happen? Because it's motivation. Intention.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.600
 If we correct the motivation, then it will correct all. If we don't correct, it will dilute it.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:45.020
 Even it's good. It's the same way, like a beautiful nectar, something delicious, a nectar in a

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.880
 golden bowl.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:52.640
 If we put the boson in there, then even though it's a big bowl of the nectar in a golden bowl,

00:01:52.640 --> 00:02:00.000
 a small amount of boson will dilute it. It will lost value. Instead, it becomes natural, it becomes

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.920
 like that, toxic.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.280
 Toxic. So that's really what always says, teaching says. For that reason, the greatest teacher,

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:15.640
 the Buddha Shaktaman, said, always reflect the mind, correct the mind, correct the mind.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:22.180
 But in the teaching, he said, correct the body, correct the speech, correct the mind, but among

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.800
 that,

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:30.080
 mind is soul, while that's so crucial. For that reason, what we teach, we try it.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:37.960
 If you display, tame your own mind, that is my teaching. Time. That is Buddha teaching.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:43.120
 Time is so important, so that's why correct the motivation is so important, and that is the

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.160
 beginning good.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:50.640
 Noble, beginning noble. And beginning noble is, again, joy, appreciation, bodhicitta,

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:58.880
 pure understanding or pure realization or the very undertaking, with beautiful devotions. When we

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:59.520
 meditate,

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:06.880
 start practices, then we need really the devotions. Devotion is so important, important.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.960
 With all the devotions, we won't get really realizations in the teaching state. It's like sunlight.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.640
 With all the sunlight, no matter how much for the light, we put all that in green to bring,

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:24.240
 trying to have the growth of the fruit of vegetable. With all the sunlight, it won't really happen.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:30.320
 Something we have to substitute the sun, because even in the modern time, the technology time,

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.200
 they even don't have the sunlight, but they put some electric light or something substitute.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:41.790
 Same way, devotion is so important. It's not a problem. It's not skeptical. It's not just kind of

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:42.160
 like,

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:48.560
 as kind of like beliefs or things, but that makes difference. You can witness our self.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:55.450
 We can witness our own self, and we have to put the devotional ingredients, so devotion is

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:56.240
 important.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:01.440
 With that, and now, we go to the middle part, middle novelism.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.760
 Never the sixth part of my life, I've been talking that, and we went through those,

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:12.640
 kind of like one up and down, slowly by slowly, where? And today, again, I've told this.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:21.280
 Deon Paramatas. Samti jay parodu sampas. Something, in a way, something. It is Deon Paramatas.

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:27.920
 And the Deon Paramata is, then, it's like concentration. It's simple to tell. It's concentration.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:34.160
 That means, the birthday time, our mind is not always concentrated. That means, the mind is very

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:42.640
 skated and distracted, so that Deon Paramata will help to bring calm, long mind to essentialize it,

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:49.680
 so that we can focus on it. Not skated. Skated. When we're skated, what is happening? We're skated

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.960
 with all the emotions. And the emotions are wondering in the object of the pipe-sensorial

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:02.880
 plate objects. Form, beautiful form, beautiful sound, beautiful smell, beautiful taste,

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:11.120
 beautiful touch, beautiful feelings. We're really distracted, all that. We're distracted of the

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.920
 past,

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:18.400
 those thoughts, present, that thought, in the future, that thought. We're always out. Our senses

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:26.960
 are all turned out, trying to crave that, craving that, searching, searching, looking. And then,

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:33.280
 there is between the hope and fear, the challenge, banging the fold, the clashing there, and then,

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.560
 dragging down us, down to that, and then, kind of, bumping a little bit up, and again, dragging

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.120
 down.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:45.520
 We've been on and on and on, and after that one. And that is trouble. That is some sorrow in the

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:51.760
 Buddha taking. That really makes all of this. So many things. We think we have been to ourselves,

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:58.400
 we're smart in that reality. The quality we're banging into our own head, by our own

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:05.920
 fist, no one else doing that. And so, for that reason, telling mind is so important.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:10.720
 In the time of the mind, when you have the constant treasure, it will bring the beautiful

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:20.400
 college, beautiful hidden college, mind, courage, commitment, confidence, calm, peaceful, soothing,

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:28.400
 calming, fulfillment, relaxing. Really, all that atmosphere is just really kind of like,

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:36.000
 just as a spring. It's like booming one after another. It's showing up there. That's what really

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.600
 is so important, to be honest. So, again, if you go there, and then, of course, we make it,

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:47.920
 well, I make it quite a few times, and you know that. Mind is so important. It controls everything,

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:54.080
 both samsara and nirvana. So, for that reason, then concentration is so important, important,

00:06:54.080 --> 00:07:00.560
 and so powerful. And from there, we started nirvana, nirvana. So, for that reason, again,

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:07.200
 we told that. And I said, over the day, then concentration is, to do concentration is, then,

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:15.840
 do the retreat. That's what we discussed before, retreat. Retreat is to retreat. Physically retreat

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:15.840
,

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:23.440
 mental retreat. Or in its Vedic, lupvempa and in sea members. Also, I discussed it, and I listed

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:29.120
 that. And in order to do that, bring up that vempa, what in the teaching said by the great Master

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:38.000
 Kamala, Sumerai, to all those six. Those are the cause of the good meditation, good practices.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:44.320
 Or those are the six conditions, cause and conditions to have good meditation, good practice.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:49.920
 But at the same time, they are the maintaining of the meditation and the practices. And even

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:56.460
 bringing the fulfillment to that. So, those are six. Again, I'm talking the six. It's not six param

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:56.720
ata.

00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:02.640
 I mean, it's part of the six paramata, but I'm talking those six. I listed, and you, I believe,

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:08.880
 whenever you remember that, or maybe even you wrote that down. And those, again, the first one,

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:15.040
 is pebble. Stay in pebble of places. That's the number one. That's what I said already. I'm

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:23.200
 repeating what I said last time. Pebble of places. Stay in pebble of places. Places.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:32.880
 And the second is, less desire. That I said. I mean, I'm not saying, I'm saying that because that's

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:39.120
 what the great Master Kamala Shala said. And that's what Buddha taught. And the third is,

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:50.720
 more contentment. Content. That is. And then, the fourth is, good morality, good conduct.

00:08:50.720 --> 00:09:00.480
 Good conduct. That's what I said. Pebble is, less activities, reduced activities.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:14.960
 And sixth is, less thought. That is. That is retreat. That is retreat of the beginning.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:19.760
 That is retreat of the middle. That is retreat of the final stages.

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:25.600
 Think of that opposite side. I already went through those last time.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:34.800
 Stay in pebble of places. And we don't stay in pebble of, unpebble of spaces. And we stay in

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:46.240
 unpebble of places. Places. And we have more desires. Less content. No good conduct.

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:58.960
 And more activities. More thoughts. Then, that is not retreat. That is not meditation.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:04.800
 That is not the practitioners. We're losing the very fundamental goal

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:13.200
 and essential point of the practices. Follow in Dharma. Even we want some gained good result.

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:20.320
 Achievement. And we don't have those things. Our practice becomes surface.

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:27.600
 There's only hovering on the surface, not taking the root. Root is in the A.

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:37.040
 A. That is what. So that's why he said, it's cause and condition of good practice. That sixth is

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:44.800
 good call and condition of good practices. But also same time. It's just a good cause and condition

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:50.800
 to maintain it. That means now, as we have started practice, we like to be continually

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:57.040
 maintain a growth. We like to be growth. We like a development. Successful.

00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:05.040
 That's, those are the tips. Those are the six tips. Really, six tips.

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:11.440
 If we continue to maintain the six, it will bloom the clothes. The enlightenment.

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:19.280
 What are your goals? For example, that means in Buddhism, the goal of the Arhatthagot.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:24.560
 Goal of the Parthang Buddhas. Goal of the Bodhisattva. Or Bodhisattva. Will bloom.

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:34.800
 High. Beautiful. Dead. And to do that, then when you have those calls, six calls and those tips

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:43.680
 to maintain it, then there is aware again, five obstacles. That's more related with the practices.

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:51.120
 Now, now you are in a beautiful retreat. All those six are, all those six are you,

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:57.840
 quiet out, you get up those six, the calls and the condition. Now you're practicing.

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:03.600
 You begin to do the intentional practices and make the time to schedule all the practices.

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:09.520
 Are we doing practice now with it? And those are the, I listed when five obstacles.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:16.240
 There was a great master right there and said, five. I went there again last time.

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:21.040
 And also, of course, you all know that many times, many great master.

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:26.000
 What I'm talking is the same teaching by all the great masters. All the teachers,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.800
 they did the same thing. I follow the Buddha teaching. So this is what Buddha teaching.

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:38.720
 Teaching is the Buddhism teaching. It is the Mahayana teaching. And so those five obstacles,

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:46.480
 those are the five obstacles. Two obstacles, I went in the obstacle for the beginning of the

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:47.040
 practice,

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:54.560
 to start the practices. And one practice, that is, one obstacle is the obstacle of the

00:12:54.560 --> 00:13:02.640
 during the practices meditation. Now two obstacles, I said obstacles to the growth of development

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:10.800
 progresses. Those are the five obstacles, I would say, they were called in the Tibetan

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:19.760
 state is something jnipatna. Five errors of the mistakes, five errors, errors of the mistakes

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:28.720
 of the practices. Practicing, those are again, very crucial important tips pointing high

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:35.760
 light of our weaknesses. Weaknesses, you think all these so many numbers, numbers, this, this,

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:42.320
 the one, this. That the ego tricks. We like to do this kind of like without anything that,

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:48.480
 then we like to just move on to the located on the samsara as we be. We like to change,

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:55.440
 we like to correct, we like to activate, we like to redirect our direction from the way we've been

00:13:55.440 --> 00:14:02.240
 doing for a big list of time until now. That's what really our whole point of the practices.

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:08.510
 We set the beautiful goal and we set the spare your kind of pathway. We really going to do

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:09.280
 something

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:15.920
 to make the difference of that. I've been kind of tired and I've been bold amidst samsara

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:23.360
 situations. So long time. And of course this life, this time I have the memories I've done now

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:32.240
 that according to Buddha's teaching, this is not his first time. They've been low many times,

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:40.560
 life after life, we've been in these times. Ups and don'ts as we used examples last time,

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:49.680
 that as the bees come trapped in the honey jars, big honey jars, jars end up going up and down and

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:58.720
 up and down. There is no stepping out. We created such a dilemma, vastness of the duality, distrust

00:14:58.720 --> 00:14:58.720
.

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:06.960
 Really is a disturbing, disturbing and as all everything is bouncing back to ourself.

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:13.440
 The core of Buddha's teaching is nobody else doing except ourself. It's our own creations,

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:21.520
 our own nightmare. Our own nightmare we are going on that troubles with nightmare. It's creation of

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:31.200
 our own mind. Same way. So now with that, there's five obstacles, five errors I listed.

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:40.160
 And today I'm going to list another pie with support of this, that five errors. And you're

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:46.800
 going to remember, of course, those who know already is just reminded, oh it's just another

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:52.320
 that you heard already learned. But those people who don't know that heard it, these are the tips

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:59.280
 again. Tips and you remember that and you're going to write down if it's possible that or you can

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:09.730
 memorize that too. Either way. So first is, number one is joy of the practices. Joy of the practice

00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:09.840
.

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:19.920
 So that means the joy at the moment, presence of joy, appreciation, interesting of the practices.

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:31.440
 Whether it is Dharma meditation, whether it is sadhana practices. Joy. That post is joy. Second is

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:40.640
 effort. Effort. That means continuations. It doesn't mean continue all day and night,

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:49.600
 but continuation of the everyday. Everyday sun comes, sun sets, moon comes, moon sets.

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:58.240
 Again, sun comes, sun sets, breeze, air, rain, sun, shadow, what's called clothes,

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:06.480
 the everyday. There's soothing. Continuation. The nature is continuing. We like to keep continuing

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:16.320
 momentless. Moment. Same way. That is what means. Effort. Continuing. Not just one time

00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:22.320
 and once, what's called here, sometimes once in the blue moon, do something and they're gonna stop.

00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:30.800
 That is not going to work. Everyone change, that's not going to work. So continuation. Effort.

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:39.120
 In the teaching I said, effort means continuation. Everyday, as we eat, as we have breakfast,

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:45.920
 every day. Every day we have lunch. Every day we have dinner. Every day we eat snacks.

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:56.720
 It's a continuation. That's the continuation. That's what we're talking. Effort. Even though

00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:01.680
 you have to make tea and this and that thing, this modern time in technology or development

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:09.920
 country is so easy, we still have to make effort. Effort. That is what talking effort. We're doing

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:16.800
 that, not doing that. That effort, we're not doing that. We're boring. Tired in all this desperate

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:22.880
 situation. And we're doing that with the joy. We wake up only or now I'm going to have breakfast.

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:31.280
 I'm looking forward to the breakfast. Excitement, breakfast. I have to relax in joy. I mean, that's

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:42.720
 about joy. Joy and continuation. And then third one is mindfulness. Mindfulness.

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:54.400
 Remember. Mindfulness is remembering. Remembering. Close to you. Remember yourself. Remember around

00:18:54.400 --> 00:19:01.040
 you. Remembering others. Remembering the instructions. That is remembering.

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:08.720
 Mindfulness is remembering. Remembering and keeping up that remembers.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:17.200
 That is remembering. It's also continuation. To do mindfulness, we need some degree of effort,

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:23.840
 too. So keeping that. Effort is good. You should think. Don't let forget that.

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:31.120
 Remember. Mindfulness. The next one is consciousness.

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:41.680
 Consciousness is checking up, check in, check out, check in, check, checking out,

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:50.800
 checking of our activity of the body, our activity of the speech, our activity of the mind.

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:58.560
 That means what I'm using the "I" "our" but it means actually "myself". Checking up my mind,

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:04.240
 checking out my body's activity, checking out my speech's activity. How I'm doing.

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:13.360
 You become yourself as teacher, instructor, trainer. Trainer. That is consciousness.

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:20.560
 In the debate, it's called "bau yu". "Gosong" or "chosong nepai". "Shivin". In the debate,

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:27.680
 it's called "shivin". "Gosong yai da kuchivin". Always kind of rejecting.

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:35.360
 And checking out the activity of the three doors. Body, speech, and mind.

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:46.560
 That is "pokt". Coincidence is "pokt". "Pokt". The fifth one. The fifth one is "balance".

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:54.880
 Relax. Economy. Balance. In the debate, "dang yun". "Dang yun". Balance.

00:20:56.080 --> 00:21:05.280
 That means not to forceful, not to loose. Just right amount of the speech. Right, right amount.

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:13.760
 That is "pip". "Pip". Those five are again "chiefs" of the support of "trip"

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:21.520
 purify to remove that five mistakes or five errors of the meditation or practice I listed.

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:27.920
 Or in the teaching listed, what I did. They are the, they are the like, oh, like, what's it called,

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:34.000
 the "anti don't". Or they are the like, you know, like, that will play with those five obstacles

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:43.440
 of the practices that I listed or the days. So now, you know what? We know that. Now, of course,

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:49.200
 you all know this. I'm not saying that you only know these things. But you all know what I went.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:22:01.920
 I went above the meditation. Meditation has two, body meditation and mind meditation. Or in other

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:10.000
 words, the both, I use the other word, the body hermitage and mind hermitage. Two hermitage.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:18.560
 Both are needs. And I truly have that, those six cores or the connotation of the meditation

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:24.880
 and the practices as great master Kamala Chala pointed out. I went through that. We went through

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:34.000
 that. Once you have that, nowadays watch out. These five obstacles may occur during those times

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:43.600
 or five mistakes. We went those listed, what are those highlighted obstacles. Now, today we went

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:50.960
 to, to put a part, to remove that five mistakes of the meditation practice. There is five.

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:59.360
 We went. All those were the five tips, five tips of the meditation. And we now, we have that all

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:04.880
 tools that we now got off. All the instructions we got. Now we're going to put into the practices.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:14.000
 Practice is then known as meditation. That's the beginning of meditation. Meditation begins with

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:20.160
 postures. Those are the seven postures of the body of every other. So that means now we received,

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:26.720
 we know now all the instructions, the tools, all how we act, how we do. We know all that. And

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:34.080
 everything is in our radar of the wisdom. And now we are going to put an action, begin to practice.

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:41.600
 Practice is then silence meditation, any kind of meditation of the Vayayana Sadhmas.

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:47.360
 All our meditations that begins with a call and an instruction in the teaching. And we have the

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:54.480
 capabilities and the capabilities and it's not too difficult. Start with seven postures of the

00:23:54.480 --> 00:24:04.400
 Buddha Verojana. That is extended postures in the Buddha teaching, always mentioned in all the

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:11.840
 instructions of the Praxilenides, seven postures of the Buddha Verojana. Many of you already know

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:18.080
 that those things. But I will go over those there. And today I will stop here again to this summit.

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:27.680
 I'm taking slowly and saying to you, but we are progressing. We are too lucky. So I will do that,

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:33.360
 but you all know the seven postures. I think already. But I'm going to repeat the next talk

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:40.960
 tomorrow. I will say it again one more time. And so that's it. And then you will say again,

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:52.320
 now you know, tomorrow what he's going to talk. Okay, he's going to talk. But I hope you will

00:24:52.320 --> 00:25:03.280
 come back. Thank you. Today with all those beautiful tools that were not, and I really

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:08.160
 began to practice it. If you do like to do it during his practice, seven postures of the Buddha

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:15.120
 Verojana. Wonderful. If you don't feel uncomfortable, whatever was comfortable with the postures,

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:21.120
 then we really celebrate the Buddha's enlightenment, Mahabharata and nirvana, conquering all the

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:29.840
 Mahas and then as well as walking to the Bodhi trees. And I mean, all his many major activities

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:37.200
 of his in-life activities, we celebrate that with our beautiful practices of this Bodhi darvara

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:43.600
 series. So now feel strong presence of the Buddha Chaturmuri, the Gharapama Sambo dara,

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:50.400
 Buddha's Bodhi sattva, all the Bodhi sattva, such as at Bodhi sattva. And then for us all,

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:57.690
 other Gharapama Bodhi sattva, really feel strong presence there, and then we renew our Bodhi darv

00:25:57.690 --> 00:25:57.920
ara

00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:04.160
 series. Renew our Bodhi darvara. So please, feel strong and really pull. And then also,

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:10.400
 we get again this merit for all the healing purposes. Healing of all the sickness, the

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:15.680
 trouble, the difficulty of everybody is going through, trouble going, but also fundamentally

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:22.080
 cause of this old trouble in the Buddha teacher always is obscurations. So really here, purify

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:28.240
 that obscurations and then transform those obscurations, those fundamental, those negative

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:33.680
 causes of those negative emotions start going into the wisdom status. So then it all becomes

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:39.520
 the display of the activity of the wisdom. So that with those we were told and then our

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:46.080
 practices, if you have this booklet, really we start with this booklet. This and which is the

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:55.200
 ceremony of reciting the receiving vows of the Bodhi darvara according to the instructions of the

00:26:55.200 --> 00:27:11.200
 bhakti-rumbudhi, great master bhakti-rumbudhi.
