00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.840
 My question is about how to understand everything that is being enlightened.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.560
 Everything that you like to know.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:18.240
 So, I think last week, maybe you said that, for example, baricana is the form of skandhas,

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.640
 and then also I've heard that the five gandhas are the five wisdom.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.000
 So what do we mean to, are somehow the five skandhas also the five wisdom?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.880
 Like, is there, is baricana a pervasive form, the wisdom aspect of form?

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:43.600
 Or is baricana some, like what is it, how exactly are we supposed to apply the notion to see

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.480
 everything as a form?

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.680
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, I understand, I understand.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:59.520
 The nature, the nature of all this is known as great emptiness, or mahashaneda.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.760
 You're asking the mahashaneda? All is emptiness, emptiness.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:12.560
 Emptiness, again, that I'm sure you all understand, it didn't mean blank status.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.600
 Emptiness is infinite, openness status.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:29.070
 That openness status, according to teaching, is known as dharmadhatu, dharmadhatu wisdom, in the

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.400
 wisdom levels.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:38.720
 That emptiness is also known as in the dharmadhatu wisdom,

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:47.760
 and that emptiness is also, from that emptiness, arising every displace, arises.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:55.600
 So where the old display of the forms, where it coming from? From dharmadhatu wisdom.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:04.650
 So the everything, the old forms are the emanation or manifestation or display of the dharmadhatu

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:05.680
 wisdom.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:16.320
 So dharmadhatu wisdom is the foundation of the, in a way, wisdom, or wisdom and forms.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:22.960
 And then, when it came to the form level, like forms, or including our body,

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:30.400
 even though it made us form, we call form, but nature is empty.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:37.920
 Nature is empty, so that means, nature is the emptiness of the wisdom, wisdom.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:45.440
 And from that, all these five wisdom, where they come from? Five wisdom, for example.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.840
 Wisdom of the mero-like wisdom.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.320
 Where they come from? From dharmadhatu wisdom.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:04.080
 So, dharmadhatu wisdom is what? It's empty. Mero-like wisdom is also empty, empty.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.960
 There's no really difference of the nature. It's the same emptiness.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:16.960
 Why it's called mero-like wisdom? Mero. There's a matter of, mero, it didn't mean it's mero.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.760
 But it looks like mero.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.800
 What is mero does what? In a common conceptual or informal world.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:30.320
 Because it's reflecting all the images to the mero.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.560
 Similarly, all this emanation of the dharmadhatu,

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.960
 dharmadhatu reflect to the, to our intelligence wisdom.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.280
 It looks like that's what to give clear analysis to us.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:51.120
 The Greek teacher would use terminology, other example, as mero.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.640
 Mero. I mean, just for example, I see, you see.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.040
 Oh, I see. I hear. I think. I see all these things.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.680
 But where inside? Where? Where that is?

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.120
 It just reflect me. And when you see reflect me on the mero,

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.800
 common, where those forms are in the mero.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.400
 Again, it's the same, almost the same. It may be not exact.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.000
 There's nothing really to find. It's even though it's reflect.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.040
 That is a reason. It's called mero-like wisdom.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.480
 Mero-like wisdom, that is what is, and that is,

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.080
 all the forms are natural. It's empty. That reason,

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.240
 then mero-like wisdom appeared in the form of, in the form,

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.320
 poem is about a major surface. Major surface.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:44.080
 In the form levels. Or, or maybe I shouldn't say poem.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.720
 And then is the Buddha mero-chanas.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:55.680
 Oh, maybe I'll mix it up a little bit. Sorry. And that,

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.920
 that Buddha mero, that, that dharma-dhatu in a,

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.200
 in a, when it's reflected as like poem,

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.600
 in a five-hour regard, and that is the, the

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:13.360
 dharma-dhatu version of, is poems. Poem, natures.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.800
 And then mero-like wisdom. What that is?

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.800
 Consciousness. I aggregate our consciousness.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.280
 And the next one is what? The feeling, no?

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.800
 Poem, consciousness, every word will go with that.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.840
 And feeling.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.240
 Yeah, feeling, I think. Feeling aggregates. Feeling aggregates.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:49.520
 And the feeling aggregate is, no.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:56.320
 Zo, solva, ayaya solva. That's what is feeling. Feeling aggregates.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:03.120
 Feeling aggregate is, is the wisdom level. Again, our way that feeling of,

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.320
 wisdom level, what that feeling aggregate is.

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:11.840
 Whether it is, is equanimity versus nothing.

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:17.360
 Equanimity versus nothing. In equanimity versus nothing, now the feelings came.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.280
 Feeling is, is what that feeling aggregate

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.120
 is what is the equanimity versus nothing. Equanimity versus nothing.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:31.280
 Why is named as equanimity? Now, all these feelings,

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.880
 feelings, there is good feeling, bad feeling, and neutral feeling.

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.840
 And this, I mean, a whole variety of the feelings.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.040
 And all togadhi in a great study of Buddha,

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:45.040
 teaching divided for the gross level, eating, I think, feelings.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:49.440
 Related with eating, different senses, that eating.

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:54.000
 So all that, that. But even though it is an appearance like that,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.280
 where we need to come to, who will see that? Who will see yada?

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:04.800
 It's all blended in the mind. Mind all is blinded on our

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:10.880
 blended in, in our, in marrow-like questions.

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:16.080
 All is blended in. And there is no difference of the good feeling,

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:20.320
 bad feeling, neutral feeling. There's nothing. It's all econimity.

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:25.280
 All is equal in the mental states. It's completely equal.

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.960
 And that feeling aggregate is then known as,

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.600
 as renas, some of us. Because the feeling what,

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:37.840
 every kind of luxury items in the world, every thing, luxury thing,

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:42.160
 that is known as luxuries. If you have good feeling, good kind of things,

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.680
 like the more good feeling, all these luxuries, for that reason,

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:51.600
 is called the dasam, the bad, richness brother of the

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:56.640
 brother, richness brother. And the next one is then

00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:05.280
 dead what? But now it's what? Feeling as though it's all about the she.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:12.640
 The she. The she. The she is the she. The she is I think perceptions.

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:18.640
 Perceptions. Perception was perception and

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:23.840
 perception and conceptions. So now perception is,

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:30.640
 what are perceptions? Perception is in the, in the Tibetan is called,

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:35.040
 or in the Buddha's city is called, in the Tibetan translated as

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:41.520
 the she. The she is ideal. The she is

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:49.840
 believed. The she is nominated by mind. You nominate it, you vote under that.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:56.640
 Even though there's nothing really existing, and such as title, names,

00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:00.480
 and rules, and regulations, and traditions,

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:05.680
 all this category is really kind of roughly is in the

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:11.520
 the she, in the perceptions, perceptions, perceptions. This

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:15.920
 perception is so important in the samsara. It's

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:21.200
 really so important. So many people do things

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:25.600
 because of their perceptions or their beliefs.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:29.760
 Even though there's nothing really existing externally that's

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:35.040
 so intangible, it's just we all do things, so many things.

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:38.640
 All this violence, believing this, believing that,

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:42.400
 all good things, bad, whatever good is because

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:49.520
 is perceptions. Reality perception is again, same thing. There's no extra

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:55.840
 independent existing. It's mind. Mind. There's nothing else. That

00:09:55.840 --> 00:10:00.640
 perception is, in a wisdom level, is known as

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:06.400
 discrimination, awareness, wisdom, or distinctively understanding clearly

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:09.520
 that wisdom. So that means kind of clearly distinct,

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:14.000
 all this good, that's the bad, this is man, that's the woman, this is the bad,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.840
 and this is brahma, this is the chat, there are, I mean all this, this is the

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:28.160
 CEO, C-E-O, C-O-C-E-O, and is not, she is not C-E-O, I mean

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:34.800
 all this, we make labels that reality is the same. I just, people, that's nothing.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:41.280
 But he makes that and follow that and he walks, walks, that's it. And that is known

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:44.880
 as like

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:49.280
 perceptions. And this perception is the wisdom level,

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:54.240
 is discrimination, awareness, wisdom. And again, that discrimination,

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:57.280
 awareness, means, distinctively understanding,

00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:00.640
 distinctively understanding clearly a way

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:04.480
 of death, that everything clearly as it is,

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:08.480
 a way of death, and nature is same as emptiness,

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:13.120
 as down to death. There's nothing again existing,

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:19.440
 existing. And with that apparent form, then is it, on a Buddha form, that is the

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:23.680
 Buddha Amitabh, I think, Buddha Amitabh. So this is called

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:29.440
 Buddha Amitabh, Amitabh. Then the consumption, consumption is

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:34.080
 all the thought and emotions generally, and those are like 52 or

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:38.720
 one of the different emotions, thoughts, those are mental evenness, all those.

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:45.200
 And then it's mind, mind. And that is then, and that is then,

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:49.680
 in the wisdom level, all accomplishing wisdom.

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:53.440
 Because all those mental evenness are well

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:57.920
 targeted and highlighted, and what things you like to fulfill, whether you

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:04.960
 like, or do not like to do, all that is performed, the judge, and activated

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:09.440
 by that consumption, by mind, symbol, itself.

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:12.800
 And that, that what it does, it's fulfilling whatever that is, is

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:16.080
 fulfilling, fulfilling action, fulfilling activity.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:21.520
 When that, that, that, that in the wisdom level, in all

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:25.200
 accomplishing wisdom. So it's the accomplishing,

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:28.400
 according to your capabilities, according to that situation,

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:31.840
 it's a complicated, bigger, or somewhat whatever layer it is,

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:36.640
 that they're complicated. When that Buddha, the Buddha, when their

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:39.600
 effort, that form of Buddha, then he is known as

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:45.360
 Buddha Amoga Siddhas. So that's why his

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:48.880
 reality level is all universal disability.

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:52.400
 It comes from this, even though there's already this and that thing,

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:55.920
 but the reality level, its nature is the same,

00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:01.200
 but for that reason, then it's called all enlightened states.

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:04.880
 Okay, thank you.
