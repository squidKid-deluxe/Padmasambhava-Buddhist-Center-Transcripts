00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.070
 In this series of videos, we are going to discuss how to experience all pleasant and neutral sounds

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:14.240
 as well as how to experience all pleasant and neutral sounds as well as how to experience them.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:22.790
 We follow up with that. Then what does emotion? It is not just following that, but it is expanding.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:29.840
 It is deepening that emotion, expanding that emotion, elaborating that emotion.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:37.190
 Then, for example, there is anger you follow with that. Then there is all, in the Buddha teaching,

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:44.960
 there are nine different kind of, like, traumatic negative anger emotions arise one after another

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.680
 when you follow up with anger and that.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:55.030
 Because then you start, "Oh, such as this he did, or he did, or he did." In the past this, now

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.960
 doing, future doing, I mean all those different ways, then expanding.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:20.430
 And this, he heard me first, he is going to hurt in the future, he is hurting me now. And then he

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:28.740
 taught my joy in the last past, he is taking my joy now, he is going to take, he or she is going to

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.560
 take joy in the future.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:38.910
 And so that makes six of that. Then it expanded to our belongings of all the relatives, of friends,

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:46.850
 of families, this person did to my relatives bad things in the past, and now doing, and future is

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:56.290
 going to show, going to do this, and that all called the nine-traumatized conception ideal comes in

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.040
 mind because we are grasping on that.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:05.580
 And then it is expanding, those are the days, the density, small, big, or medium, the different

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:13.980
 degrees is called, but that then is how the word "laboration" is developed and then it is called

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.080
 negative emotion.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:35.680
 Then it is all accosted in our clear state of mind.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:59.040
 When we follow this thought, or when we follow this thought, that means that we are keeping up, we

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.880
 are adding the fuel, we are adding the fuel to maintain that.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.440
 And then it will continue to grow and deepening and expanding, it will disturb us, it will disturb

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:19.520
 others, and then it will create the whole environment, in, out, secret, and many levels, all that.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:29.860
 And therefore that reason, to be as a practitioner, then cut instantly, immediately, immediately

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:39.730
 cut that, that net, that connection, cut that, that grasping, that disturbance, and then we become

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:47.300
 the warrior, bravery, that support, then you are not crushed under that emotion, under that

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.160
 situation,

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:55.360
 we are, then, truly winner of now and the future.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.020
 (speaking foreign language)

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.200
 - And then hear all this thought,

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.020
 whether whatever the sound is,

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.120
 whether it's pleasing, unpleasing,

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.920
 or even his neutral thought is all emptiness.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.720
 And we don't have any grasp or cling,

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.000
 you don't hold the grasp.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.040
 Relax on that natural stress.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.400
 The moment you relax on that natural stress,

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.320
 that moment we get to see the emptiness sound,

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.840
 which is the sound of the Buddha, voice of the Buddha.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.440
 Or in life, being free from the word and unseasoned status.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.640
 (speaking foreign language)

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.240
 And the moment you hear that moment,

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.580
 that very moment is empty.

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.320
 (speaking foreign language)

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.880
 And then this is called sound emptiness,

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.360
 or sound emptiness, or emptiness sound.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.360
 (speaking foreign language)

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.840
 And then I told you this is known as the speech of the lama,

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.120
 or the absolute speech of the lama,

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.680
 or the speech of the Buddha.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:39.680
 To that, I pray, and then to, I pray to Gopiye Masambo.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.840
 So that is about the song.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.200
 (speaking foreign language)

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.040
 And the next thing,
