00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.080
 We should practice it, but when we could really lining up toward that, to transfer that

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.000
 consciousness.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 That is what we are going to talk, according to the teachings.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 In order to that, in the teachings say, you can make every effort, your effort to sustain our body.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 That everything we have, you can do. And that is what, according to the Buddha teaching,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 the medicine practices and then conduct the behavior.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 So that means dietary, conduct, all those what the expert says, what do you know,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 should apply to maintain and to keep up this precious human body, this life.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 As I said, we should not, in the teachings say this, I am not saying that.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 As I said, we should not say, I like to live, I don't like this ball.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 That is not the solution, according to the teachings.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.350
 In fact, when we do that, according to the teachings, we create more bad karma than the clayware of

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:06.000
 the karma.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 That trouble is not going to go away.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 Karma is like shadow, according to the teachings.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 Even though we don't see shadow ourselves, but shadow is there.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 So in every situation, opportunity, there is always shadow came, shadow efforts.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 For that reason, great master J.M.K. said that karma is like, for example,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 when birds fly in the high of the sky, you don't see any shadows.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 With the fact that water is already high, you really won't see any shadows.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 But moment, as soon as they are going to land on the ground,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 that moment is shadow efforts.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 Similarly, karma, maybe we won't see immediately that, but karma will come.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 This is what is our deed, our activities.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 Whatever we did, according to the great city of Bodhaka community,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 it will return back to us, as like boomerangs.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 When boomerang, when we throw the boomerang, I understand, it will return back to you.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 To you. Same way, karma will come back as boomerang.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 But when it came back to ourselves, according to the teachings,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 it will become more lower, more bigger, more stronger.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 It's not just that, only that will come back.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 It will come over multiple ways.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 That is not just bad karma, but good karma too.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 Bad karma, good karma.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 This is the same example in the teaching used, as when we planted a seed,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 when we planted a seed or when we saw the seed on the ground,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 one seed, one seed, we're not expecting one seed,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 one fruit or one result, one grain from that one seed.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 It will multiply it, multiply it.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 For example, apple seed, we planted apple seed, one apple seed.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 It will break the whole tree and hold maybe hundreds of the apples.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 And not just only one hunt, year after year.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 That is examples of the karma. It's not going to stop.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 So therefore, if we say sometimes, "Oh, I don't like this world,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 I don't like that, I'm tired, bored, all these things,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 I like to live and can't rely on doing that."

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 That is the immediate cause, it's known as destroying the divine body.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 And in a way, in the Buddha's teachings,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 it will become the murder, killing something.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 Killing is, as I said in the Buddha's teachings, there is merit on virtues.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 Among them, the number one connection teacher, Buddha, I like it.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 Killing is the number one.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 It is big, big obscurations, big, heavy garments, heavy garments,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 that we have to pay, as I said, according to the teaching, it will come back.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 Come back, so therefore, we should do it every way to prevent that.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 And plus, this body is like special. This is like breaking the body with sustenance.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 And not just the only device residing there,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 but according to Buddha's teaching, or the way of medicine,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 this body has so many beings relying on our body.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 This body is a residence of so many beings.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 So that means, when we stop the body,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 we destroy all of that token there,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 and they don't make it about the Divine or the one person,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 Buddha or more Buddhas, Buddhas and the teachings.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 That don't make all that also destroy.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 So therefore, it is very, very important, necessary and important.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 So those are, in a way, the Buddha teachings,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 measured medicine, ceremony or the acumen,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 meditation activities, and then, as well as, conduct or the dietary.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 Now you did those old things, and also you got some indications,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 all this now going to change our lives.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 Those I mentioned yesterday, I call the teaching,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 you're indicating all the different signs and you did those signs.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 And now, even you did all those practices, the taking medicine,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 doing everything, not preventing, not stop, it's continually happening, happening.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 Then, it is now becoming, coming, but however,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 then when it comes, what is this?

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 Nowadays, then, also science.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 Science is going to come.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 If there is a force, graduation, that we are dying or leaving this body,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 all suddenly, this is more, every normal person leaves graduation.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 And then, of course, there is suddenly,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 people have no accident, that happened, but every people,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 this is the every people.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 Now you go to six, six, and you're taking medicines,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 not doing, they didn't really happen anything.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 It is just a coming from two million other,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 and you're doing the ceremony, practice, meditating,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 accumulate, meditating, and your dieting,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
 all those, everything, getting up, everything,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 it's not really happening, it's happiness.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 Now, if this is really happening,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 then, what is teaching?

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 What is the graduation teacher?

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 But again, Gopi and Masala are teaching.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 It's called, called, kuna chak sai, chien chapayun chien,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 dhammasarunga, you know.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 In the six part of practices,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
 six part of practices will help them.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 It is really nice and translate.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 Can God help me?

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
 Then, so I can read this to you.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 And, I hope I help you.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 (Sadhguru speaks in the background)

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 But basically, in six part of practice,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 I pray that we have put them.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 Six part of practices said,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 now, that time, whenever it comes,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 now, we have to respect our courage,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 courage and commitment.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 Try to not evolve with emotions.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
 In the teaching, what is that?

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
 Part of teaching said, avoiding the emotions.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 What kind of emotions that has?

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 Attachment and anger.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 We should not have any.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 Attachment and anger.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 And particularly, attachment.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 Something that will be attracted.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 Thank you, Raul. Yeah. Yeah.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 Thank you. That's a really nice, nice translation.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 Thank you. Thank you.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 Oh, yeah, this book has it.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 And here, what is it?

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 (Sadhguru speaks in the background)

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 In the part of the movement, death is donning upon me.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 Abundantly, attachment and clinging to everything.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
 Remaining the spirit of the clay and structures.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 Transfer the unborn self-evolution into the openness of the spaces.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:09.000
 When we are able to lead this body composed of the clay and the blood,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 realize this is environmental illusion.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 That is the essence of the teachings of this moment, of this time.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:25.000
 First, we have to, as he said, we have to change our attitude.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 Don't be grasping or attracted to something, clinging.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
 And the same thing, don't hate something.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 Or I can't, or I regret that, or I don't feel.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 No more that. Any of those thoughts.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 Any belongings that you have, all gathered,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
 targeted mentally, make that offerings.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
 I'm sure you prepared in this country to do those.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 In Asia, maybe they don't do too much.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 That goes, what's it called? Whills? Whills.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 Whills, and all those prepared.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
 But still, don't attach it. Don't cling.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 Even though you met them, designated everything to these individuals,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 these to them, but now gathered mentally, that whole,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 make that offering, mandala offering to the Buddha, Amitabha.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
 Entirely, a Buddha's bodhisattva teaches.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 Make that mandala offering.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 Generally, in Buddhism, there are three things that we need.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
 Strongly attach it. Strongly attach it.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 That is, first is our body.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 We attach it to our body.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
 Second is we attach it to our world.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:41.000
 Well, third is we attach it to the repetitions,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000
 our positions, or our managerial activities,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 or our good deeds, or something that I'd like to do continually.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
 Something, all that.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 World is one, material wealth, but also is included in our relatives,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 family members, anything, those who are considering as part of the luxury,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000
 part of the wealth to you, even though they're not material object like that,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
 but they are part of the wealth.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 This time, everything you make offerings.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 Really, make that offerings to Buddha's bodhisattva, all the enlightenment,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
 particular to the Buddha, Amitabha.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000
 And you can remember and think that in half the mind, by bagging this offering,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 may all these peoples and everyone be enlightened

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
 and free from suffering the difficult trouble,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 connected that to the bodhisattva.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 Make that offerings to all our wealth.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
 And then our physical conditions.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
 Bodhi, as in the teaching itself, is the illusion,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:48.000
 is the composite of the bone and flesh and the muscles and all that.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000
 When we concentrate, and before we concentrate, we don't have this body.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000
 We don't have that.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 This body came maybe 80 years ago, or 70 years ago,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 60 years ago, or 30 years ago, or whatever, that is all, 80 years ago.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 Before that, we don't have this body.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
 This is not permanent state, this.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
 So, this is therefore, don't get ratchet again.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 Make this body also offer to the Buddha, Amitabha,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 and all the Buddha, the bodhisattvas, that.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
 And make this benefit to all the beings, again,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 make that offering as bodhi to them, make that offerings.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 Then our reputation, the meritorious, particularly such as the meritorious activities,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
 such as practice, meditation, all that.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 Remember those, make that offering too.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000
 You made good kind of reflective, that means to your past, what you did in life.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 I did good things, I did this, I did that.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 You can think of that.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 But I have not came to think clearly of all of those,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 but all those good deeds are what we have you did.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000
 We are the kind of uplifting joys, uplifting kind of aspire yourself.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 I did great.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 Stay on the standing firmly on the ground of the joy and appreciation

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
 and that you did good.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 Good.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
 And thinking of everything that may offer us.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
 And of course, practice meditation each time we did it in that marriage

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000
 for all living beings.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 Do again this.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 And then our petitions, our positions, our whatever we did

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
 and whatever we couldn't finish the complete.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
 Make that whole offerings, whatever you do.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 I did wonderful, I did my best.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.000
 I shut my share.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
 Share I did.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000
 Really feel happy, the joy, and make that offerings.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000
 No more regrets, no more troubles, no more worries,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 no more thinking, no more concerns of the family, the Jesus and the death.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
 They will be survived.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 That's throughout these stories.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 We think all of that, maybe all they can survive.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 I'm not the only one.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 Or maybe they will start again.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.000
 Ever you go on, what will we do?

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 These and that.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000
 Things.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 But everyone will survive.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
 Everyone will do their best, too.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 And why are you boring and concerned?

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
 Now you're going to direct your thoughts, your journey,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
 your spiritual path, your enlightened status,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 your transparents, transparents.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 That is what really we need.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 We need to do.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
 So reactivate the poor meditation.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
 Poor meditation as we learn, as we learn,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 regularizing yourself as the video yogini,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 and talking with all those channels, all these things.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
 Trying to regularize that.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
 And now this is all happening.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 And now for example, gradually we are ending that.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 Then different elements are beginning to dissolve,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 one after another.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
 And those are the one in the teaching said,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 five senses, five organs, and five chakras.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
 All those will be started dissolving.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
 To start starving, they're losing their strength.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 Why that happened?

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 According to Buddhism, over here in the teaching,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 the wind is the most powerful.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 Among all the elements,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 wind is directing every element.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
 Or A is directing every element.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 Every element.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
 Even though art is so important,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 why is it so important?

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 Why is it so important?

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000
 But this wind element is really kind of like directing

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
 all the other elements.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 So when we have started kind of the strength of losing,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
 that means according to the teaching,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 the wind is now unbalanced.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 Our wind element has become unbalanced.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:06.000
 And that immediately effect to the whole system of the chakras,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:12.000
 organs, senses, senses, and that immediately.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
 And that immediately effect then in the teaching said,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
 well, it will effect to the here.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000
 It will effect to the eyes, eye bones.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 And that immediately, for example,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
 also you don't see clearly things.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
 Things clearly has become blurred in these states.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
 You don't see.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
 So the eyes don't cut kinds.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 And also you can't hear so clearly.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 Clearly it gets all kind of like,

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
 that becomes a bit, I mean, the blurry.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
 But sound is not so clear.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
 So the vision is not so clear.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000
 It's become almost kind of blurry.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:00.000
 And then the eyes is not so clear.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
 It's also can't hear exactly as it is.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 Around that time, then in the teaching said,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 the navel center is the first navel chakra.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 It's the first to become the unbalanced.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
 It effect immediately navel chakras.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
 This navel chakra is, according to Buddha's teaching,

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
 this is also past chakra.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 All the other chakras develop slowly.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.000
 But past chakra is navel chakra for that reason in Buddhism.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
 Navel chakra is what in the Buddha's teaching,

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000
 named chakra of the emanations,

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 where all that everything is developed.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 Now that, that, like this etymology,

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
 or that is like going down.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000
 And so when that happened, then in the teaching said,

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000
 again I might be making a little bit clear of this.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
 And there is a different, different signs, welcome.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:10.000
 External signs, inter-design, and secondary signs will come.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 The external signs will come.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000
 That time, the eye level, you don't see clearly.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000
 You don't see clearly everything become kind of blurry.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000
 Blurry at that time, chakra level is,

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:32.000
 navel chakra is losing the strength or the balances.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000
 And that moment also is affecting Twitter.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.000
 That means the art element is also now become unbalanced.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
 Art element of the physical.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 Art element of the physical is going to happen,

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:53.000
 and that person individually become so unstable.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 Unstable.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
 So that means, I think maybe in the morning time,

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000
 gravity is losing.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.000
 Gravity is losing.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 They can't lift their necks.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000
 They can't stand on the family.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:14.000
 And all that art element, that is a sign of the externally art elements.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 Inevitably, in that individual heart affair,

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000
 mind is become very kind of blurry.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000
 Mind itself become not so clear, not close.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000
 And the secondary level in the teaching said,

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 that individual begin to see like almost varieties.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:39.000
 That everything is moving, moving, and like as varieties.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 So that moment, then what is also lost,

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 strength of the pain crisis,

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000
 that function of the pain crisis is also stopping.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000
 So art element is really dissolved.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000
 When art element that merging,

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000
 that's immediately effort to the water elements.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 Water, water element.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000
 Now water element is dissolved.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000
 And water element is dissolved in that moment immediately,

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000
 in effect also to the heart chakras.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.000
 Heart chakras.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 And that individual is also in externally in scene,

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 everything is become kind of dry, dry.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000
 All this is dry, and everything is left with dry,

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000
 and all that things really happen in conversation.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000
 Those are the externally.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.000
 Inevitably, that individual is become very agitated.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000
 Agitated and also convoluted, stressful.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:45.000
 Or agitated, stressful, convoluted, moods change,

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000
 strongly changing, changing that.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000
 Those in one response.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 Most simplified in the teaching said, that moment,

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000
 kind of see the most smoky colors.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000
 Smoky, kind of like, smoking things.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000
 According to the teaching of the Vedayana,

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000
 these gender in this mirage, in the smoky,

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000
 all those vegans are signs of the clear light of the minister.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 That's all reflected in the different forms.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
 So it's not really bad.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000
 But however, those are vividly seen

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:22.000
 by these conditions when that element is dissolved.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000
 Element is dissolved.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000
 And then in that effort in the teaching,

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 he said the water element is when,

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000
 when the water element is dissolved,

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 that moment also affected the kidney countries.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.000
 Kidneys.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000
 And that individual is allowed,

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000
 can't hold in the water very well.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000
 And those are like, like liquid is coming

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000
 from the different mouth, mouth,

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000
 mouth, all the ground from the different places.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000
 Kind of liquid is all that.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000
 So that is sign of the water element.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000
 Now those people who really have the,

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000
 know the practice of power,

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000
 this time instead kind of worries

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000
 and concerning all that,

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.000
 now is about the time to transfer the consciousness.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000
 Use the practices.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.000
 Because now this time still,

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000
 our kind of mind is still quite stable,

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000
 our mind is moving, feeling is there,

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.000
 you have knowledge,

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000
 you have the level of awareness.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:27.000
 So you should use the applies this time, this time.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 And then, and again with that happen,

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000
 water element is dissolved,

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000
 kind of loses strength.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.000
 Then in the teaching he said,

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000
 it merged to the, to the, the power elements.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000
 When the power element is dissolved,

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:47.000
 externally that individual becomes very cold.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000
 Cold, warm is not there.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000
 Warm, all this is like kind of, you know,

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 warm is there.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000
 The cold hand and the feet,

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000
 and then all this becomes cold,

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.000
 start getting cold.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000
 And in Italy that individual's mind

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000
 is now become very kind of weak, not completely calm,

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:16.000
 very, very, become blurry and just really full of blood.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000
 In the civil level that individual is beginning to see

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000
 as almost a kind of fire class,

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.000
 sparking, sparking things coming on another.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000
 Spark is there.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.000
 And that is the sign of the water element,

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000
 sorry, fire element is there.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000
 That moment then in our teaching said,

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000
 what, the speedy chakra is losing strength,

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000
 or that time is not just the one.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.000
 Speech, speedy chakra is losing strength.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000
 And that moment also then,

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000
 the what called level function is losing,

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.000
 or the stop, stop in there.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.000
 So one after the other, all that happens.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.000
 What happens?

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:12.000
 Then now with the fire element,

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000
 it's now merging with those that lose strength

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.000
 and it is only where it goes to the wind elements.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000
 It's finer to the wind elements.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000
 Wind elements generally, what?

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.000
 There is five winds in the Buddha's teaching man.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.000
 There is many numbers of winds related with five senses

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000
 and all that, but now they are all reduced,

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000
 they are all drawing inwardly, and now the five winds.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.000
 Five winds are now coming up all different direction

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.000
 to the center wind in the heart levels, center levels.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.000
 Center levels at that moment,

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000
 then that individual is externally see

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000
 that breathing is become so difficult.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.000
 Breathing is become very difficult and let.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:08.000
 Breathing in and out is become very difficult.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 Difficult.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:14.000
 At the same time that individual, so that is external science,

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.000
 inwardly their science, then they don't really mind.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000
 Everything is become so, look at the kind of fading way,

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.000
 mostly they are reduced, because now there is no,

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000
 according to the teaching, mind is like this,

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.000
 all these old senses are the passage of the mind,

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 they are the window of the mind is sparking though.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000
 Now they are reduced, they are strengthened,

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000
 so therefore their mind is become very dull and dark state,

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000
 very dull state, dull state.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.000
 And at all that time, then what is become,

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:01.000
 the chakra of the cigarette chakra is lost, completely controlled.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.000
 Balance of the cigarette chakra is controlled,

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:11.000
 and that moment all the winds are completely merged.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:16.000
 Then there is one mind which is called the life force wind,

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 according to the teaching, life force wind, and that moment,

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:27.000
 then the lung, the organ lung is losing the stem,

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000
 or it is functioning, functioning.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:35.000
 So then it's controlled, the whole elements are ended.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 Water, sorry, earth, water, fire, wind is now started.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:50.000
 And then around that time, then I say the other day too.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:56.000
 Then the position, locations of the two elements

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:05.000
 that we obtain from our balance are going to lose their positions.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:10.000
 And that in the teaching said, the force is the current chakras,

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:16.000
 current chakras, and then what we obtain from our pattern,

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:24.000
 the white element is coming down, coming down.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:30.000
 And that is really, then coming as I said, now that practitioners,

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:35.000
 if they have practiced the bhova, they are really quite good of the bhova,

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:40.000
 they should definitely not try to ask for it.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:45.000
 They sort of, even in minute teaching, some teaching said,

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:50.000
 even just the beginning of the process of dissolving those elements.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.000
 For example, after the element is dissolving.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000
 Dissolving those signs you read and now you experience that

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:04.000
 and really try to keep the concentration of the meditation.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:11.000
 And that passage and that consciousness and the amintabha above head

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:17.000
 and really try to think of that and ask for consciousness.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:22.000
 If somehow you have the print, those are practitioners,

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:27.000
 they can also chime that phrase, this phrase to you.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.000
 It is reminding, even though you are very good,

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 but still in accordance teaching, it doesn't have to be too assuring

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000
 and helping to that to re-stand the things.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000
 So then you dance for it.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000
 But how do you work, now what is happening?

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.000
 As I said the other day, now these two elements are going to merge.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.000
 Merge.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:57.000
 And in teaching say, the white element is coming down, coming down,

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:02.000
 as from the kurung jakara and coming down to the heart center.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000
 In Buddhism, in the Vedic energy, in Buddhism,

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000
 the mind is really residing in the heart center.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.000
 Heart.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.000
 Heart.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 So it is coming down to the heart.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.000
 Heart.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.000
 At that moment, what is vegan?

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.000
 Inner vegan.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000
 Now it is all inner vegan.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:28.000
 Now your external organs or poor organs, all those are stuck.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000
 Poor organs don't stop it.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.000
 Stop it.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000
 That is known as in the teaching said,

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.000
 now you don't have the external breathing.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000
 External breathing is completely stuck.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000
 Now still you have the accord in the teaching,

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000
 you have still subtle inner breathing, inner breathing.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000
 So that time, this white element is coming down.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.000
 Coming down.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000
 Coming down.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000
 And it comes to the heart.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000
 And the vegan as I said, what is that?

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.000
 The clear wood vegan.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:06.000
 As like the bullion, the poor moon evening,

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000
 evening we need to come to when you have the skylight.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:16.000
 That moonlight comes down to the floor from that skylight.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 Use the example in the teaching, as moonlight from the skylight,

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.000
 where we believe white comes, comes down.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.000
 At that moment, that emotion in the teaching said,

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:36.000
 related with the emotion, all the anger, related the anger emotions.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.000
 Anger emotions are completely stuck.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:45.000
 Related to the emotion of anger are all stuck for a short time,

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000
 or for my time beings.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:53.000
 At the same time, now the red element is coming up,

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.000
 is not its position or its location.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.000
 It is coming upward, upward.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000
 And what is it that individual is experiencing?

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000
 Everything becomes as reddish.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000
 Red, red gallows.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:14.000
 And this beat when red and white, co-occurrence trout, beat when.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.000
 So when the red element is coming up in the teaching said,

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:24.000
 that time all the emotions related with attachment are stuck.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000
 Stuck at all.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:32.000
 When it is troubled that, the wind co-occurrence is troubled with two elements.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:37.000
 That moment, moment, then what?

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:43.000
 All the related emotions of ignorance are stuck for time beings.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.000
 All that stuck.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:53.000
 So then that time that individual is known as, or pronounced as, death.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000
 This coming, moving of these two elements,

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000
 pulls up the remote board.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.000
 They call the teaching, it won't take long time.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000
 It just really is, of course, maybe dependent with individualism,

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000
 but it's just a matter of the monetist.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000
 In the monetist, it won't take long time.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000
 It just that happens.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.000
 So that is the moment of death.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.000
 And that, now when we do the powa,

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:25.000
 we do the powa, as I said, at the beginning, when it is starting.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:29.000
 Well, your awareness is quite still clear at that time.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.000
 And not just the only powa, restrengthen.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.000
 As in the teaching here, one Guru Praveen Masam has said,

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.000
 reactivate your instructions of the teachings.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.000
 Now teaching is only going to help us.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000
 Us.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000
 And all the past we are did of the samsara activity,

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000
 don't concern any, as I said, not concerned.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.000
 Also the Praveen member, Praveen there,

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000
 you are supposing that in the teaching,

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000
 say that the Guru Praveen Masam is teaching,

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000
 trying to that individual leaves for calm and peaceful,

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000
 not creating emotions.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.000
 Even if it is an emotion, it will be inspired.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000
 He is nappy.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.000
 Whatever the belief they have, help with that belief is.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.000
 If they have Kshyala to believe, it's only going to heaven.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000
 Felt that.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000
 Really, now you are going to heaven.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000
 Don't worry, we will be okay.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000
 You've been so good person.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000
 Mother, you've been so good mother.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.000
 Father, you've been so good father.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.000
 Or if it's brother, you've been great brothers.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000
 If it's husband, you've been great husband.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000
 If it's wife living greater.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000
 Wife, boy is boy in the children.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.000
 You've been greater children.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000
 You did wonderful things.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.000
 You go heaven, then we will meet or come back,

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.000
 not come back, we've been Kshyala.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.000
 But we will meet.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000
 You will meet in heavens.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.000
 You did wonderful things.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:56.000
 Really, soothing, calming, uplifting, encouraging.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.000
 That emotion, that thought is so important.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000
 If that individual leaves the peaceful mind,

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.000
 happy mind, it has a future bright.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000
 Bardo and everything will become bright.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000
 So therefore, according to their belief,

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000
 not according to my own belief,

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000
 I may have some different belief than them.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.000
 No, I'm telling that.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000
 That is not the time to tell.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.000
 Helping to believe whatever their beliefs.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000
 That is supporting and helping and ushering.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.000
 Ushering to their destinations.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000
 And therefore, with mind is echoed.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.000
 Mind is so powerful in the Buddha teaching that we know, we learn.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:41.000
 Whatever mind decides, whatever mind makes,

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.000
 it really will become that we make.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000
 It will change the directions.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000
 So where should we help and support them?

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.000
 That is really important.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:00.000
 Any created emotions or said, crying, all that,

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000
 that will make, according to the Buddha teaching,

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 it will make trouble to that individual.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.000
 It's not the time to cry.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.000
 Even if we are crying, maybe go a little bit outside,

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000
 though that individual, you won't notice,

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.000
 notice or not fill that hour and cry.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000
 Of course, it's sad time.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.000
 Sad time, we all cry.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.000
 It's not something that only people cry.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.000
 Sad time, difficulty time, to every level.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:31.000
 But that is not the time to express that to that individual.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.000
 Individuals.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000
 And a living up statement.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.000
 Nice, calm.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000
 And every of the Buddha is practicing.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000
 Tell the Buddhist Buddha's teaching.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000
 How the Buddha's masters did.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.000
 How they left a great enlightenment.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.000
 For example, Umm Chiba.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000
 Of course, Umm Chiba is highly enlightened.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.000
 When he announced that he is going to leave this world to his students,

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:58.000
 he said, now I will leave this world alone.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000
 I'm so happy and so delighted.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.000
 That my happiness and the delightful status

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:09.000
 cannot be compared to a person who went to the ocean,

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.000
 got the jewel.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.000
 In ancient time, in the Buddha's teaching in India,

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.000
 they said that those ancient times,

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000
 margins go to the ocean.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000
 And going to the ocean to reach the jewel island is very difficult to reach.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.000
 It's so many days.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.000
 Difficult troubles.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000
 The pop-up dollars and this and that.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:31.000
 That and then the hurricane or typhoons and all these things.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.000
 Things.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.000
 When you got there, you collected the jewel and returned it back.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000
 Also, so many difficult troubles.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:41.000
 And also in those areas, so in the jewel land in the teachings,

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.000
 there's many troubles.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000
 But if you're able to go there and get the jewel,

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:49.000
 when you turn back to the shore, how much this margin is happy?

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:56.000
 Nunki says, I'm more happy than those margins for further those goals.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:04.000
 And he also said, I'm more happy than the Indira when the battle with the Asuras.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.000
 And in the teachings, Indira and Asura for the god and the semi-god,

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000
 they fight, fight.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.000
 And so sometimes it's difficult to win.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:17.000
 But when Indira won't battle, he will be so delighted and so happy.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.000
 He said, I'm more happy than Indira when they won't battle.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000
 Battle is this.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.000
 This is about the religions.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.000
 So now I will leave.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:36.000
 I go to the immortal state, fortress, fortress, fortress of the immortal states.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:42.000
 That's our culture. That's what Nunki says. Of course, Nunki has trouble doing that.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.000
 But many great masters and said, what this is.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.000
 The other great master said, death is not death.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000
 Death is getting enlightenment.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000
 Death is not a death.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.000
 Death is entering into the Dharmakayas.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.000
 Dharmakayas.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.000
 This is true.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.000
 This all is that statement.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000
 Reality, there is no death.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:08.000
 The consciousness is never going to die according to Buddhism.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:11.000
 And then of course, also Christianity.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.000
 Christianity, all that is used too.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.000
 It's not like this.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.000
 Something is going to happen.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000
 It's not ended yet.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000
 So why are we warriors?

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.000
 Why are we sad?

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000
 Sad is not going to help us.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:30.000
 Boring or the fear, F-E-A-R, fear is not going to help us.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:35.000
 It's there. We stand and reactivate our practice in meditation.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.000
 Meditation and maintaining that.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.000
 That is really so.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:52.000
 And we stand and what Nunki can say and do that.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:57.000
 And he can say, remain in the sphere of the clay and structures.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.000
 And what Nunki can say.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000
 That's the statement that I had before too.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.000
 Remaining the sphere of clay and structures.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.000
 Try to remember the structures that Buddhist practices.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.000
 You see the teachings.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.000
 What in particular you are teaching.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.000
 You see so poorly all these teachings.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000
 Details, pacifically.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:22.000
 Buddha, great siddha, Buddha layout everything as like road map.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:27.000
 Every way he said what there comes in everything is so clean.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.000
 So, keep down the structures.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:34.000
 And then he always says, task filled, unbound, sub-privileged,

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.000
 in an open-ended space.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.000
 This is the dharmakaya poem.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:44.000
 The unbound consciousness merges to the unbound dharmakaya status.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:45.000
 Status.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000
 That is the best.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.000
 Then you don't have to worry about the concentration,

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000
 all the very yogis and so forth.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.000
 Just relax.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.000
 That was a great man.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.000
 Many great masters said,

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:00.000
 if somehow you didn't remember all the poet structures,

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:05.000
 all that, if you're able to maintain our mind in a natural status.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.000
 Status.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000
 All those are dissolving,

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.000
 merging one after another those merging status.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.000
 Status.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.000
 Real and lateral is a display of one's own mind.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.000
 His mind is experiencing those.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.000
 Mind is emptiness.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.000
 We looked.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.000
 We think.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.000
 We searched.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.000
 It's not just something that we are.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.000
 I heard mind is empty.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.000
 We looked ourself.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.000
 Where is mind?

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.000
 Ourself.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000
 We did not find.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.000
 Not just we.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.000
 No body formed.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:41.000
 Even the most self-guided physics.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:46.000
 The expert physics never formed so far.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.000
 And all the Buddhas, bodhisattvas,

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.000
 never formed this or this mind.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.000
 Mind.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:58.000
 So this is your mind and my mind.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.000
 Mind.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.000
 There's nothing to die.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.000
 Who is dying?

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000
 What will die?

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.000
 Who is dying?

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.000
 The other level of mind.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.000
 Really, the deeper thinking of that,

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.000
 activating that is true.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:14.000
 True statement.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:20.000
 We're not pulling, pulling, pulling ourself.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.000
 We're not pulling the leg of ourself.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.000
 It's true.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.000
 It is true statement.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.000
 True statement.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.000
 What it says is true.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:34.000
 Why we don't stand on family truth at that crucial times.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.000
 Maybe some other times you can play games.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.000
 Games.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.000
 But that is crucial time.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.000
 Stand firmly on that truth.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:50.000
 This is the time to stand firmly on the truth as it is.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:51.000
 This.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.000
 So that is what the really thing you said.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:57.000
 Then, for example, I brought that,

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.000
 I brought that to the merging of those consciousness.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:03.000
 And then I said other day.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:06.000
 Then you have the opportunity to reach enlightenment

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:09.000
 to the Dharmakaya and also Savagaya service.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.000
 Those are the important in the teaching.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.000
 After that, what's it called?

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.000
 After these two elements are joined,

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.000
 consciousness like between two,

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:22.000
 then it won't stay that joint,

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:25.000
 that close that kind of merge.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.000
 It won't stay too long.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.000
 Too long.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.000
 Too long.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.000
 It breaks out.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000
 It can't impact so strong.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000
 It stay for a moment.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.000
 But then it divide or separate out.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.000
 It loses its own strength.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.000
 Then it can't just dissolve back to there.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.000
 It can't merge.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.000
 It just ends there.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000
 Then consciousness becomes alone.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000
 Completely single out.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.000
 Single out.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.000
 So that time, our experience will be there.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.000
 Or not experience.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:57.000
 That time, I will really see the true,

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.000
 exactly nature as it is.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.000
 Is Dharmakaya.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.000
 Or the true nature of the mind.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.000
 We'll see, exactly as it is.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.000
 When you practice it,

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.000
 this light comes as looking practices.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.000
 Then you come immediately.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:15.000
 You recognize that.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.000
 And then you can maintain it.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.000
 That says, prolonged time.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000
 And those are, in the teaching,

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:24.000
 say that those individuals who have that cover bullet,

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:27.000
 they stay, for example, in the Tibetan is very popular.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.000
 Popular or the African,

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.000
 those are practicing in the past with them.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.000
 Stay in meditation.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:37.000
 And the five days, one week,

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.000
 or even some days, for months even.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.000
 So that, the whole of the teaching,

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:47.000
 then they stay in Dharmakaya.

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.000
 That says, that says.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.000
 And when they stay there,

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:52.000
 stay in that state,

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.000
 their body is not declined,

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.000
 or not become smelly,

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:00.000
 and the brilliant color of the brightness stays fresh in us.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.000
 Everything stays.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:05.000
 So those are very kind of signs of their residing

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.000
 in Dharmakaya state.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.000
 So that is Dharmakaya.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000
 They reach to the enlightenment,

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.000
 emerge to Dharmakaya state.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.000
 And up there,

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:18.000
 then, I said the other day,

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.000
 those light comes.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:23.000
 Comes and beams.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.000
 Beams.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000
 Beams of light and light.

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000
 And the song, those come.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.000
 Beams, songs, comes.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.000
 Comes, and those are, again,

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:39.000
 display of one's own, own awareness, wisdom.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.000
 What's a display?

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.000
 So reality is not only coming outside,

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.000
 it's a display of the nature,

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000
 luminously call it,

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.000
 of the nature of the mind.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:48.000
 It's appearing.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.000
 And then, again,

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.000
 if those people who practice it,

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.000
 like Toga practices,

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.000
 practices,

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.000
 then immediately recognize this own display

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.000
 and then get, again,

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.000
 emerging to that state,

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.000
 without any distractions,

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.000
 being a subject or object,

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.000
 and they reach to the Sambokaya state.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.000
 Also the Toga state.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.000
 And then, this, again,

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000
 up there, also then,

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000
 many times it comes,

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.000
 many different times.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.000
 Again, another big song,

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:22.000
 another big pyres,

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.000
 another big kind of water in there.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.000
 So all the elements are coming.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.000
 In reality,

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:31.000
 elements are part of the nature of the mind.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.000
 But now that reflecting,

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.000
 the element of fire,

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.000
 water, wind,

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.000
 after elements are kind of like

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.000
 reflecting it as driven images.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.000
 So kind of like big,

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.000
 what's called ravine,

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.000
 big ravine scene,

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:50.000
 and as well as big pyre coming,

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:53.000
 and big kind of like water coming,

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.000
 and big wind coming,

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000
 with the noise, with the song,

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.000
 all that coming,

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.000
 again, if you recognize,

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.000
 those are known as then,

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.000
 the wisdom displays.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000
 Again, reality is the wisdom.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.000
 Then reach to the Sambokaya state,

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000
 and when you reach that state,

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:12.000
 the Sambokaya is there too,

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000
 it's not separate.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:15.000
 And once you see that,

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.000
 that state is edgy,

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.000
 edgy, or that,

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.000
 and then, furthermore,

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.000
 then, although it's coming.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:25.000
 The energy of Allah,

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000
 continually dawning,

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:29.000
 all those different light and so on,

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.000
 and then figures are coming.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:34.000
 According to the Dandara teaching,

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.000
 and those peaceful Buddhas,

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.000
 and Brahma Buddhas,

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:39.000
 and then maybe,

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.000
 those who don't have that,

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.000
 those Dandaric teaching,

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000
 but different images are coming.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:46.000
 It's called a teaching,

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:47.000
 a different religion,

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.000
 just like dream.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.000
 So not necessarily,

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.000
 when we see the dream,

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:53.000
 the reality is a display of our own mind.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:54.000
 So that means,

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.000
 it is.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.000
 It's mind is the Krikaya state,

00:46:58.000 --> 00:46:59.000
 in the Dzokhi state,

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:00.000
 or the Vedic energy.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.000
 So all that dreams are the Krikaya emanations.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.000
 But we don't see,

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.000
 our Sambokas are moving into dreaming,

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:07.000
 as optic and object,

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.000
 all the different things coming.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.000
 Similarly, even though you,

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:12.000
 those deities,

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.000
 you didn't recognize,

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:14.000
 these are all different figures,

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.000
 are coming one after that.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:17.000
 With that happened,

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:18.000
 I already said,

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.000
 and you already know,

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.000
 I won't go back anymore,

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:22.000
 but then,

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.000
 that individual becomes very scary.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:26.000
 As a face,

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:27.000
 and a subject,

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.000
 an object,

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.000
 and then lady like that,

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:31.000
 and then also,

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:32.000
 that individual,

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:33.000
 when they are going through that,

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:34.000
 our father,

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.000
 then they are not completely scared,

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.000
 feeling of the insecurity,

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.000
 and a little bit tired,

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:42.000
 and very kind of like,

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.000
 like bold,

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:45.000
 and scary,

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:46.000
 and tiring,

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:47.000
 and all that.

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:48.000
 It's the same thing,

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:49.000
 those things are coming.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:50.000
 So they like to avoid,

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.000
 they like to run away from there.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:53.000
 That happened,

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:54.000
 then more is coming,

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.000
 yes, all,

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:56.000
 the shadows,

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.000
 can't really play shadows.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:59.000
 But reality,

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:00.000
 I mean,

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:01.000
 it's like shadow,

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:02.000
 but that individual,

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.000
 those people don't recognize.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:05.000
 So that is a part of the experience,

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:06.000
 all of that.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.000
 So those are the brief teachings

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.000
 on the part of the wind

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.000
 we should transfer to consciousness.

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:13.000
 Consciousness.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:14.000
 Again,

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:15.000
 as I said,

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:16.000
 see,

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.000
 in terms of consciousness transfer,

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:21.000
 what we mean,

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:22.000
 that happens.

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:23.000
 Yes,

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.000
 in the beginning of those

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:26.000
 emergent elements,

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:29.000
 time is the ideal time,

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.000
 trying to advance further

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.000
 and pour wine into the practices.

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:35.000
 Oh, action.

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:36.000
 Action.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.000
 And so that is my brief talk,

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.000
 but maybe I'll just stop here,

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.000
 and we have some food,

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:43.000
 and I'm sure you do what we discuss.
