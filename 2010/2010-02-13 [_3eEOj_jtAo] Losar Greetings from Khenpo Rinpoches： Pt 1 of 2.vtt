00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:25.040
 Happy New Year!

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:36.560
 And this year begins the 2,137th and Iron Tiger years, so we wish happy, again, healthy and

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:44.840
 beautiful new years.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:51.440
 And they are called astrological, then this element of the year is known as Iron, sign

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:59.760
 of the year is known as Table and therefore it is known as Iron Table years and it is one

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:24.720
 of the rotation years that moves every 12 years.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:53.360
 And again, during this new year, our resolution that we came back, that is then trying to really

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:00.560
 develop the joy and peace, happiness in our mind and heart and trying to also promote that

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.560
 to the other beings as much as we can, can throw contacts of the teaching of the Buddha

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:14.120
 and then bring the joy, peace, harmony and that what we all wish to you and pray for

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.120
 them.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.440
 And again, this is very special year or the new year is very special to everyone and for

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:27.160
 that, again, in this time, we are going to pray and confirm these blessings of the Buddha

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:54.120
 and the Buddha and the Sangha, we make this prayer so that we hope that come true to all

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:01.120
 of us.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:31.120
 Amen.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:01.120
 Amen.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:31.120
