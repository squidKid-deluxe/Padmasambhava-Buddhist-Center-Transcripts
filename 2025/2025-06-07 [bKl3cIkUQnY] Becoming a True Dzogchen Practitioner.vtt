NOTE     "synopsis": "PSL One Month Dzogchen Retreat\nChetsun Nyingtik\nVen. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche\n\nPadma Samye Ling retreat center\nApril 12 - May 10, 2025\n\nDay 11\nMay 8, 2025\n\nThe first Dzogchen masters left this world in a characteristic way: in a rainbow body of light after giving a final teaching to their disciples. In Tibet, the ones who spread the Nyingtik (heart essence) teaching of Clear Light were the great masters who possessed their special direct transmission, chiefly the great scholar Vimalamitra and Guru Padmasambhava. Vimalamitra passed these instructions to Chetsun Senge Wangchuk, who also attained the rainbow body. The teachings he left were later revealed by the First Khyentse, and are part of the secret category of Dzogchen pith instructions, Mengagde.\n\nThese rare and extraordinarily profound teachings precisely explain various essential methods for directly actualizing the innermost teachings of Ati Dzogpa Chenpo, the Great Perfection, the Peak Vehicle, which is the direct method for swiftly realizing the ultimate nature of the mind and attaining buddhahood in the rainbow light body.\n\nwww.padmasambhava.org",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.660
 Thank you again. Thank you very much everyone. Thank you very much for participating. Thank

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:16.920
 you for coming and making all these efforts. Thank you to be here together and practicing

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.360
 a little bit, helping each other, inspiring each other. I'm so grateful and thankful to

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:29.240
 all of you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Now again, we are going to continue the teachings

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:38.360
 on the great Bhumalamitra, or Jeepshankya Vamsa, or the great Tshense, and which is back to

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:44.280
 the correction teacher, Bodhachaktamuni. All teachings, whatever you start learning from

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.410
 the Buddhism, no matter whatever it is, is all connected to the correction teacher, Bodhachaktamuni

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.600
.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:57.960
 Bodhachaktamuni came 2,600 years ago, and he reached enlightenment or become the Buddha,

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.280
 and then he shared his realization, and what he learned, and what he practiced, and what

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:10.600
 he relied on to all of us, with love, with compassion, with wisdom, and a clear understanding,

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.720
 exactly as we needed, as we did, according to also our capabilities, according to our

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.040
 readiness of that. For that reason, the correction teacher, Bodhachaktamuni, all the teachings

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:29.040
 are known as summarized as nayana teachings. Those all teachings are particularly designed,

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:37.270
 each individual, they are reading as capabilities, so that we all can connect it to our realization

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.560
,

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:45.040
 our true nature, every level, and that's what really gives it. But this time, this teaching

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:52.000
 is the highest thing, this most direct teaching, most direct point in teaching to discover

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.240
 our innate nature without relying on the time and effort too much hard came, and discover

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:06.400
 our innate qualities very quickly and easily. And that is what this great teaching is, and

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:13.720
 for that again, to observe that, to make that happen, we have to bring more joy, more appreciation,

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:21.040
 more courage, more commitment, more loyalty, loyalty, more humble, more simple, go to art,

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.360
 and then just really bring up all our qualities. We call it, means what? We devote each other,

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:35.680
 with kindness, with respect and appreciation. All those are needed to activate that. Otherwise,

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:43.800
 our ego clings, negative emotion has ruled us so many lifetimes, countless lifetimes. It's easy,

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:51.120
 kind of located by those forces, and then we can skip away from even we have the best teaching,

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.920
 the most profound teaching, kind of lost the point. Really, that happened so many times.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:04.880
 But to preserve that, again, as I said, courage, commitment, respect, joy, humble and simple,

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.760
 and a loyalty, loyal to the teaching, to the lineage, and the practice. This is not just

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.080
 that we're making this for just some reason, some kind of, make some please, someone that,

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:23.000
 but we're doing this for ourself, to make that really so I can help to myself, I can help to

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.640
 my family, friend, members, and all that. Really, again, the context of the love and joy and

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:36.560
 appreciation and respect, and also humble and simple, just not caring this and that, all that

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.640
 things, and what in the teaching says, and many times it happens in the practice, or when you put

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:49.560
 a kind of caring the knowledge or understand in the mouth, mouth, mouth, and then kind of bubbling

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.040
 that or bubbling that, or talking those, but realizationally, really, we don't have the kind

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.360
 of realization that not observing in the heart and the mind, and then with that means, where

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.560
 about in teaching said, teaching an individual when it's two different directions. Teaching

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:12.520
 when one direction, individual when one direction, even we are called expert to speaking of these

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:18.920
 and that things, things, but it's all means to absorb to the heart and the mind, to make the

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:27.160
 change to ourselves, make our improvement, improvement of our love, kindness, compassion,

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:36.120
 joy, respect, and appreciation, and patience, understanding. Then, if we have that, even we

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:42.840
 don't speak so well, all that, we are making the meaning, we're making the change, really in the

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:48.760
 teaching said that. So therefore, again, we should all remember those things clearly and bring more

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:56.440
 joy and appreciation, and then, together with the body, the thought, all living beings, and then

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:02.920
 with the understanding of this, this then purview, purview of state, of the zocchi status. So,

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:09.200
 those are all with the thought, and now we go to the, to the, these hundred practices,
