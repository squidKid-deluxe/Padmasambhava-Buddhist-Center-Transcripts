 7-part series.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:20.640
 Again, the marriage activity can be divided in two different ways, and that will bring the two

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:21.400
 different results.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:29.400
 The marriage activity will bring good benefit and good results in the well-being of the samsara.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:35.400
 The marriage activity will lead finally to the nirvana status.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:43.400
 The marriage activity will bring good benefit or good results also in the samsara.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:53.040
 Those are often known as the higher rams, such as the human rams or the god's rams, the name of the

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.400
 god.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.400
 We will take the birth in those rams.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:01.400
 The marriage activity will lead to the nirvana status, and there are three different nirvanas.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:09.080
 Generally, in the Buddha's teaching, those are known as the hiraka or the arhat hood of the nirvan

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.400
as,

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:15.100
 the part of the Buddha hood of the nirvanas, and the bodhisattva or the Buddha hood of the nirvanas

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.400
.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.400
 There are three different ways.

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.400
 Those all started again with the marriage activities.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.400
 With all the marriage activities, it won't again be the result.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:33.750
 The cause of those achievements is absolutely best and depended with the marriage activities or the

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:34.400
 good deeds.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:40.400
 For that reason, again in the Buddha's teaching, the Mahayana sutras are known as the Jyatira Ropa,

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:48.590
 which is the Lalita Vasuta, or in Sanskrit, basically it is the playful sutras of the Buddha's life

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:49.400
 story.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:57.430
 In that teaching, the Buddha said that those who have the marriage activities well-proper all their

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:58.400
 wishes.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:05.400
 The two-proper the wishes are also dependent upon one's good deeds and good marriages.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:11.400
 Therefore, everything that you see has cause and condition.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:19.270
 Without the cause and condition, good combination, cause and condition, there is no kind of result

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:20.400
 by itself.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:26.430
 Therefore, if we like to have the good result, definitely we have to work with good cause and

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:27.400
 condition.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:34.470
 Good cause and condition is then absolutely best on the bodhicitta and the good heart activity of

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:35.400
 the bodhicitta.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.400
 That bodhicitta is love and kindness and compassion.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:46.290
 And that wisdom combined, or activity combined with the wisdom with love and compassion, that makes

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:47.400
 it so special.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.400
 And that will benefit to the other beings and to yourself.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.400
 So, everything really can be developed.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:06:01.220
 Every our fulfillment and achievement in one way is becoming drawn to our own good heart with a

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.400
 good mind.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:10.400
 Therefore, these marriage activities are very, very important and very, very special.
