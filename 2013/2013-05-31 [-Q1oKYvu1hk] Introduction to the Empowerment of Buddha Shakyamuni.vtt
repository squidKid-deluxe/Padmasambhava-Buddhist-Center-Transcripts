00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.600
 Hello everyone, welcome. Today I am offering the Empowerment of the Buddha Shakyamuni.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:17.600
 Before we did this Empowerment, in the part of the ceremony, or the Empowerment itself,

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.600
 to give the introduction of this Empowerment of the teachings.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:28.000
 The introduction is the Buddha. And of course, we all know the Buddha Shakyamuni quite well,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 since we are practicing and following the teachings of the Buddha Shakyamuni.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 But however, it is part of the lineage teaching instructions,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 so I am going to give the brief introduction of the Buddha Shakyamuni.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 And after that, then, I pass the Buddha.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 Second, the lineage, how this teaching can be treated now, until now.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 And the third is the meaning of the Empowerment.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 This is not just the ceremony, but this is the second ceremony of the Vedayana teaching.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 So therefore, again, what this means, the ceremony of the Empowerment.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 So these three categories, from these three categories, will introduce,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 and that will make the meaning and the importance of this whole ceremony, an Empowerment.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 And first, I will talk about the Buddha.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 And the Buddha, as we all know, is totally enlightened,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 who came about two thousand six hundred years ago, in this world.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 But however, again, how Buddha came in this world.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 And there are three accounts, according to Buddhism.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 The Hinayana account, or the basic Buddhism account, how Buddha came in this world.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 And there is general Mahayana, and as well as also Theravada,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 Vada account, and the Vedayana account, how Buddha came.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 These are not just that somebody is interpreting how Buddha came in this world,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 but Buddha Shakya Muni himself spoke in the teachings,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 in the basic Buddha's teaching, his teachings of the Hinayana,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 the Vinayana teachings, and the Sutra teachings, and the Vayayana teachings.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 So in that light of his worlds, of the wisdom, the omniscience world,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 and we follow, as in the old, the great Master followed them.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 The first, I will talk really about how the general basic Buddhist schools

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 Buddha prepared in this world.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 First, Buddha Shakya Muni himself said that he was only beings, as many of us.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 That means we are heavily obscured with emotions.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 Emotions and struggling in the samsara, as many of us, in the ups and downs,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 all that swinging emotions, and all of that.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 But however, everyone, again Buddha said,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 every living being inherited such a unique, beautiful nature.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 Natural, the natural, that Buddha name, as Buddha nature.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 That Buddha nature is every living being has that nature.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 No one is out of that nature.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 Since we have this beautiful nature, therefore,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 if we work for that nature to grow, to glorify that nature,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 we all will become, Buddha Shakya Muni said, become the Buddha.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 As himself, he was the role model.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 Example, he was the hope to every living being.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 And vision, the destination, goal, to achieve that realization.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 That was the he said.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 So in that case, in the Buddha's teaching said,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 once upon a time, long time ago, he was king.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 King, and his name was Odin, in that very world.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 Odin, he was king, and he has beautiful elephant, white elephant.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 White elephant that he loves so much.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 And he asked to the elephant trainers, to please train this elephant.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 And of course, trainer accepted very graciously,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 he trained that elephant, perfectly, and become so gentle and peaceful.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 And one day, the Buddha, who was Buddha, the term king,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 King Odin told to his trainers, let's take our elephant,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 go to the, explore the world, explore the world, so not world,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 world or jungle, let's go to the jungles, food.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 And he said, yes, great king, I will be prepared,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 prepared whenever you are.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 So as he prepared, they both ride this white beautiful trained elephant

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 and walking in the jungles.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 Suddenly, in the teaching said, elephant started running.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 Trainer tried to stop the elephant, couldn't stop.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 And he walked, then he passed on and passed us.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 And then trainer said, very great king, hold the branch.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 Branch, this elephant cannot be stopped, hold the branch.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 So they start holding the branch and let elephant go.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 And then they both descended on the ground from the branch,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 and king said, what is this?

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 I asked you to train the elephant, but it looks like you didn't train.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 Why is this?

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 He said, oh, great king, I'm the only trainer of the body,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 but not the mind.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 What that means, king said, because I trained the body so well,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 but mind, because this elephant is in the meeting season.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 Meeting season, he smells the smell of the wild female elephant.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 Therefore, he's running.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 Then king said, how I can prove that?

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 He said, king, I will prove that after one week, about one week,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 this elephant will return to the kingdom, actually.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 He said, okay, I will watch.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 And exactly the same time, around that time,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 elephant very gently, humbly returned the kingdom.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
 He thought, wow, that's really true.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 And that's not.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 He trained the body, but he couldn't train the mind.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 Then King Odin said, who is trainer of the mind?

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 He said, I'm not trainer of mind, but trainer of the mind is known as Buddha.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 In that time, there is Buddha, Buddha.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 And the moment he heard, King Odin heard the Buddha,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 he immediately, his body becomes, what's it called, goosebumps.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
 Goosebumps came up, and it's so kind of inspiring,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 the period of the name of the Buddha.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 Then he contacted Buddha.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 He thought, I'm going to train my mind, he decided.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 That is the beginning of his journey, according to Theravada,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 or the Vinaya teachings. I shouldn't say maybe Theravada.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 But basic Buddhism said, that is the beginning of the Buddha.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 And the teaching said, there is dhrva alone.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
 So one of the section of the Vinaya teaching said,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 I understand Buddha is free from the negative emotions,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 seeing the wild elephant's mind,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 and seeing the difficulties of the sentient beings,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 therefore, I'm going to develop both each other,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 I'm going to train myself, my mind.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 Ever since, then he began to walk,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
 continue to keep that, his courage,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
 his commitment, his inspiration, what he started,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 kept life up to life, then he become Buddha.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 That is the aspect of the Vinaya accounts.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 Then in the Mahayana, in the general Buddha account,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
 Buddha is, I'm sure you heard this story,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 but once upon a time, Buddha was born in Helremes,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 and they were with a friend, they are trying to pull the chariot,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 the chariot in Helremes, and the friend was so weak, couldn't pull,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 but even he is so weak, the trainer or the, what's called that?

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 One who is behind the chariot, what's called that name?

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 The driver.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 Driver, okay, driver.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
 Driver, and his agent, agent of the Helrem, of the driver,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
 got so upset to that person,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
 one who cannot keep up as the other person,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000
 as the who was Buddha, keep up, and he beat him.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 The agent, the driver, beat him with that.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 Seeing that, Buddha thought, how he can beat him?

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 Beat him.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 He's so weak, he cannot pull.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 It's not something that he's not pulling,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 but he's so weak, cannot pull the chariot.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 Therefore, I wish I can pull, pull him too.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
 He started making more effort to pull him.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 At that moment, then Buddha, in the teaching,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 said his vision is changed, complete.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 And that is the beginning of his,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
 the aspiration of wishing bodhicitta.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 And when he developed that wishing bodhicitta,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
 and after that, he met again another great Buddha,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 known as the same name as Buddha Shaktamuni himself.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 This time, Buddha was named also, Buddha Shaktamuni.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 He able to meet this with Buddha Shaktamuni,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
 and he developed actualizing bodhicitta.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
 So wishing bodhicitta, actualizing bodhicitta,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
 coming together, then he continued again,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 keep the same, commit, correct,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
 and the confidence of the bodhicitta,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000
 and practicing the six paramatas or the ten paramatas.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 I will list the ten paramatas.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
 Of course, you all know that, basically, most of you.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 And the fourth is generosity paramatas.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 Second is morality paramatas.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
 Third is the passion for transcendental practices.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
 Fourth is joyful effort, transcendental practices.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
 And fifth is concentration for transcendental practices.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000
 And fifth is the wisdom, transcendental practices.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 Seventh is skill, means transcendental practices.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:55.000
 And eighth is the ability, transcendental practices.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
 And ninth is aspiration, or inspiration, transcendental practices.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 And tenth is known as the primordial wisdom, transcendental practices.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 So he completed all six or ten transcendental practices

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 within the period of the three countless years in the teaching set.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000
 He continued on.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
 He kept the commitment, courage, and confidence,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000
 exactly the same thing with the work of the bodhicitta.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 That means this sixth or tenth paramata

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 is the tools and means to activating, growth,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
 and the deepening of the bodhicitta practices.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 And bodhicitta, of course, you all know, is loving kindness, a compassion.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 It's wisdom combined together.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:47.000
 That thinking of all the sentient beings, how to give them joy, peace, happiness,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000
 and remove the suffering, the difficulties, and fulfill, they're all witches.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
 That is the bodhicitta.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 With that intention, kept strongly in the core of the bodhisattva's heart,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 he walked tirelessly with joyfully, not just the boring and the tiring,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 but joyfully, courageously, joyfully, he walked for that bodhicitta

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000
 and through the ten paramatas and for three countless years.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
 And that after that are completely three countless years.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
 And then, bodhicitta enlightenment in the bodhgaya.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 Gaya, and according to Berliner calendar,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 it was yesterday, bodhicitta enlightenment.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 That is how general Buddhism approaches.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
 And then in the Vedayana or the Vedayana approach,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
 bodhicitta is already enlightened.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 It's long before we reach enlightenment in the bodhicitta.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
 Bodhicitta reaching enlightenment is merely display,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
 because bodhicitta enlightens the long before as dharmakaya.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
 Achieving the realization of dharmakaya, that view.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 But through that, then he emanated three emanation bodies,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 known as rupakayas, or known as sambhokaya and narmakayas.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:08.000
 That narmakaya, sambhokaya which is resided in the field of the woman topoku.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 Akanishad known as the woman topoku, still he is living, residing Buddha.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 From that sambhokaya, Buddha reflected his emanation to this world,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 as known as the Buddha Shakti Muni.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000
 But as the moon is shining so perfectly beautiful, clearly in the sky,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 wherever there is, kasakam comes in the conditions of to reflect the moon,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 will reflect to that point or that place.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 Similarly, Buddha sambhokaya is residing in the topokava field of Akanishad.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
 But from that, through the compassion and loving kindness,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:52.000
 he emanated narmakayas as Buddha Shakti Muni in this world.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000
 As Buddha was born and rich in enlightenment, all those he showed displayed,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:03.420
 to inspire, to encourage and follow us, that we all have hope and vision we can get in

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:04.000
 enlightenment.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
 To show that once again.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
 Again, he showed all those two activities.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:14.000
 And then, when everything is completed, he merged it back to that source,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 where he emanated the sambhokaya status.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 So, that is the very generally, of course there is again in the Vedayana,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 many different Vedayana levels of the Vedayana teaching,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
 but this is one of the levels of general Vedayana teachings.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
 So, he is living Buddha right now.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 So, that is really about the Buddha.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 Now, what is, again, Buddha is full of love and compassion.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.000
 What is Buddha?

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000
 Buddha is free from all the negativities, all the negative emotions,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 and ego-cling, self-important, agreed, and nothing but true love, true compassion,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000
 and compassion and love that don t have any borders.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
 Love all the living beings.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
 In the teaching, of course, it s renormal.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
 Buddha is prone to every living being.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
 This don t have to be introduced.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 He is prone to all the sentient beings.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 His love and compassion, all the sentient beings.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
 Not just the Buddha Chaka Muni, actually in the teaching,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000
 said when you reach the Buddha, that means there is no boundaries of the egos,

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 no kind of blockage of the egos, no self-emotence, no negative emotions.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 Therefore, you become the friend to everyone.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:36.000
 And your love and kindness and compassion is emanating into every direction

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000
 without blockage, blockage without any discriminations.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
 Shining that to everyone.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 That is what the Buddha is.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 And that is what we like to be achieved, like to become the universal friend,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 universal role model of love and kindness and compassion, not just now,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.000
 but continue for all the living beings until everyone becomes the Buddha.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000
 That is the long-lost goal in the region, what the Buddha says.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
 So that is what the Buddha Chaka Muni is.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.000
 He is the Buddha Chaka Muni.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000
 When we read the life story of the Buddha Chaka Muni, how the Buddha was humble.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
 How humble he is.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
 And how simple he was.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
 How courageous he was.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 How committed he was.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
 And how wise he was.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 How to keep everything so perfectly, beautifully, and share everything.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
 Everyone is welcomed under his teachings.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
 No one is discriminated.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 And no one is like high and low.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
 Everyone is equal in the reality level.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 But what Buddha said.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
 There is no difference at all.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
 And we walked for our enlightenment.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
 We walked for our natures.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:50.000
 Truly, we all have the same opportunity, same goal,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000
 same achievement that Buddha Chaka Muni himself did.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 All in the Gora Pya Masambha, what Dara did.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 Exactly the same thing.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
 That was what the Buddha is.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
 So therefore, today we connect with these great teachers.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 Great teacher, the teacher to all the beings.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 This is again one of the very, very special and beautifuls.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.000
 Beautifuls.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 And that is really about the Buddha Chaka Munis.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 And then this teaching, how this lineage comes from, obviously,

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
 started from Buddha Chaka Munis.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000
 Buddha Chaka, this is connected more to the Vedayana teachings.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 Buddha is, of course, master of the old Nayana schools.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
 This teaching is connected to the Vedayana teachings.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
 Again, where this teaching comes from.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 This is connected to the according to the schools of Dravid Buddhism.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.000
 It is connected to the Ano-Yoga Tantra, Three Ano-Tantra,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 Maha-Yoga, Ano-Yoga, and Adi-Adi-Yoga Tantra.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 This is connected within the Ano-Yoga teachings.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 So therefore, this is then continued from the Buddha

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 to the old, to those great masters, to the Tibet.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
 And then this, again, in the Tibet,

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 there is an old, it's known as, almost Tibet, is Buddhist countries.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 And there is four major schools.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
 And among those four schools,

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000
 and this lineage belongs to the Nyingma schools of the Dravid Buddhism,

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 as I think, whenever you all know that.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 And the Nyingma schools of Dravid Buddhism

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000
 is then started with the great master of Dravid Buddhism.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000
 That is the great master, again, Adi-Yoga Tantra Rakulas,

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000
 from these great masters, and then continued teaching.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.000
 Until now.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
 And the way the teaching is transmitted,

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 preserved, kept, integrated into the qualities in the Nyingma schools,

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
 those are known as Kama lineage and Therma lineage,

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:56.000
 two major lineage systems that, through that preserved teaching,

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 it is integrated into qualities.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000
 Exactly as the Buddha spoke, exactly as Gaurabhama Samba taught,

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000
 and nothing deluded that, kept, integrated,

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 called authenticness, that lineage teaching.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 And that is what lineage is.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.000
 It's not something started very recently, newly, that is not something that,

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 not deluded by the conceptions and the thoughts and egos,

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000
 and that mind is not experimental lineage teaching.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:28.000
 It is the teaching of the wisdom teaching, lineage teaching,

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000
 lineage of comparison, that work, so many living beings,

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000
 to bring enlightenment, to realization of their final goal.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 That lineage teaching that we are connecting,

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000
 that lineage is continuing that, the teachings.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 And this teaching, then again, continues to the great master,

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000
 such as Master Mohanur Mahesh.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.000
 Mohanur Mahesh was one of the great masters

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000
 and one of the great teachers in the Buddhist history,

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
 or the Tibetan Buddhist history.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000
 He was great tehtum, visionary, scholar, master, tankar,

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 and sadas, and great practitioners.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.000
 Practitioners.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000
 And then, again, he gave these teachings.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 As he gave these teachings,

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000
 and then he combined that with Asana yoga teachings,

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 and I received this lineage teaching from many great teachers,

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 but particularly from Keqing Parthisharo Mooji,

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000
 that many of us know that.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
 He gave these teachings so many times.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 This is one of his dearest practices,

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000
 practices of teachings.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000
 From that teaching, as I received, I'm offering to you that.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000
 And this is not just, I'm offering,

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000
 maybe you received this teaching before,

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000
 but this is one of our dearest practices.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000
 We practice every, our centers practice.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.000
 This Buddhist practice becomes the principle practices

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000
 of our lineage, our Sangha members,

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000
 according to the direction of the Keqing Parthisharo Mooji.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000
 We connect to the great master, teacher,

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000
 the source of all the teachings of the Buddhism.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000
 That is so special, so important.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000
 In the teaching said, everything of the Buddha Shakti Muni,

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000
 with the golden, his scholar, with love and kindness, complete.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
 In the teaching said, I'm great master,

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.000
 often said, it brings calm, soothing, and peaceful, and gentle.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000
 It will become more ourself, more ourself.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000
 We see the value and importance of ourself.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 And we see the also value and importance of others existing.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 Therefore, respect and appreciation come so naturally, beautiful.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
 That's what really the Buddha is.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
 And then we are connected to the teaching.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 And then also in the teachings by practice of the Buddha Shakti Muni,

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000
 it will increase our moralities.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000
 It will become stable of the concentrators.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000
 It will increase our wisdom, understand.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.000
 These are the three principles, the essential practice of all Buddhism,

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.000
 no matter Hennayana, no matter Mahayana, no matter Vedayana.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000
 These three are the principle practices of all Buddhism.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 And that means morality, concentration, and wisdom.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000
 Those are known as three trainings practices, three practices.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000
 Those are the meaning of all the teachings.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000
 Every teaching of the Mahayana or the three Bhaskar teachings,

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000
 the Vinaya, Suttara, and Abhidhana teachings, what that teaching tells?

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000
 That teaching tells the morality.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 That teaching tells the concentration.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000
 That teaching tells the wisdom teachings.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.000
 That is the practice.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000
 We need morality.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000
 We need concentration.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 We need wisdom.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.000
 And we combine that three together, we will be the enlightened beings,

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000
 truly enlightened beings, as Buddha.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000
 So practicing Buddha Shakti Muni in the teachings,

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 it will increase and deepen the three training practices.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 Morality, concentration, and wisdom.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 In the Tibetan teaching office, Suttara, Tengenji, and Hira,

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000
 this is so important.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000
 This is not just important, that is the practice.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000
 The whole practice is that.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000
 This three training practice deals directly to our body,

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000
 directly to our speech, directly to our mind.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000
 It takes care of everything in the brain.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 In the larger view, it deals with form, sound, and space.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.000
 Everything.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000
 So nothing is missing out of these three training practices.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.000
 By practicing Buddha Shakti Muni, it will bring the deeper,

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000
 and the strong, and the growth and the strength of these three training.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000
