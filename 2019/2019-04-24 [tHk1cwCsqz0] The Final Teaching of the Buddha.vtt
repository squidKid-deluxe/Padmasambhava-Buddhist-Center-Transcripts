00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.400
 Dr. Togr Togr is really a Buddha. This time Dr. Togr's teaching, what we are discussing, is Toghr's

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.440
 teaching.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:19.690
 Among the Dr. Togr's teachings, among the Togr's, this is the final teaching. According to the

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:20.560
 British teacher,

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.240
 Buddha Shatamanyo or the Buddha Samadhar Bhadra, this is the final teaching.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:34.800
 What does that mean? Because all the other teachings, the basic Buddhist teachings,

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:42.960
 Sutra teaching, Vedayana out-teaching, Inadanta teaching, Mahayoga teaching, Anoyoga teaching,

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:50.260
 there is still to go, still to go, deeper and deeper. And within the Dzogr teaching, according to

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.320
 the teaching,

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:57.760
 there is also three sections, mind section, spirit section, beat and second. In the Dzogr teaching

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.920
 of

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:05.150
 the mind section, according again to the great masters, there is still to go, to the spirit section

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:06.320
 of the Dzogr teaching.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.920
 When you are in the spirit section of the teaching, still to go, beat and start with second

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:12.960
 teachings.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.680
 When you are in the spirit section of the teaching, we guys learn Togr and Togr,

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:24.190
 and then when you are Togr teaching, sorry, when you are Togr teaching, still to go to the Togr

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.000
 teachings.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.200
 Now, final, big of the teaching, the highest of the teachings.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:39.520
 That means there is nothing further to go to reveal the nature.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:47.990
 In enlightenment, Buddhahood is revealed in the nature. It's not that the way you are reminding

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.760
 strange things to do.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:58.640
 A Koda teaching is inherited nature. It's not something that just nature, but it is our richness,

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.880
 inherited nature. So when we are revealing of the Togr teaching, and it's still teaching,

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:12.960
 but still to reveal something, which is a more clouded aspect of nature, to reveal.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:19.520
 Now we will reveal the nature of the pochachas, like the emptiness aspect, or the openness,

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.200
 spaciousness of the nature of the two, but true, and now we reveal the clouded aspect of nature,

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:33.680
 then there's nothing more about to go. It's the final, final teachings.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.440
 We are in the final teaching stages of what Buddhahood taught.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:48.080
 That is what we have this great opportunity to practice in a way, grab that immediately.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:54.320
 And therefore it is one of the really, we are all very important. We are all connected to this

00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:00.960
 great lineage teachings, great teachings. That lineage teaching is completely based upon the,

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:11.360
 again, true nature. Nothing is unnatural with me. Nothing is duality. Nothing is ego-cleaning.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:21.360
 Nothing is self-importance. It's pristine, true kindness, compassion, love. That is what it is.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:29.600
 And we don't mix with duality, consciousness, and that thing. True nugget, natural teachings,

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.960
 final teachings. It's therefore, I mean, so important that we all, definitely what the

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.040
 teachings said there, and so activated those, they thought, it's very important,

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:45.230
 made the meaning for this. Now even we have that, that even we got the final teachings of the

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:45.680
 Buddha,

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.840
 but still what we have to do? We have to put that in practice. Resume teaching

00:03:52.800 --> 00:04:01.120
 while not going to get enlightenment. We have to put that into practice. The practice will

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:09.920
 combine that teaching and practice together, then become the, we make progress. We will change.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:16.320
 And therefore, I mean, this is what, for that reason, we should always really activate our

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:22.880
 joy, and devotion, and appreciation, all those people thought, those thought or support us,

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.040
 and then bring the realization. Now I'll read those understand and look.
