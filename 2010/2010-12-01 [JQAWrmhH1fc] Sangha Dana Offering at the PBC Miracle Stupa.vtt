00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 I just like to speak two words, what it means to me and for all of our sanghas.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 And as I think many of you maybe don't know, I'm one of the greatest teachers of the Nyingma

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.450
 Buddhism school and a great philosopher, and his name was Temple Padna Sherab, or Tibetan Padna

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:25.000
 Sherab.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 And he was very, very dear for me and he's my brother.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 He's been with me, or I've been with him for over 60 years.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 But unfortunately, this year, he passed away very peacefully.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 He showed every sign and indication as Buddha Shakyamuni taught in sutra and as well as in tantra.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.180
 I'm very proud and happy where he entered in Mahaparinarana and where he demonstrated to the

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.000
 practitioners,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 so I'm really, very happy for them.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 But however, again, even Buddha taught so many times in Paramananda, he's just here all the time.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 Yet, our mind is so strong, the grasp is so strong, we don't observe that very easily.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 So he's very sad and very kind of lost it.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.510
 But however, we stand in our practice in meditation by his demonstration of the way he entered Mah

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:24.000
aparinarana

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 and as we told the teachings.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.670
 So today, again, we are able to invite all the Sangha members of many different places and offering

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:35.000
 these.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 And the Kyomolori, which is sponsoring of Dana.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 Dana did this food and so we're very happy and we'd like to also ask to Sharanand Bante,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 who has been our best friend in Sharanand Bante in a long time.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.120
 Since we came here, he was here and the former General Bante again be very kind and supportive to

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.000
 get these places and so forth.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 We're so thankful again he's able to come and with his Sangha members.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 And then, as well as Korin Bante, who has been our neighbor here, right here.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 Whenever we have come here, we don't have any place to stay.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 And he's been so kind and wide ass and hospitality and his kindness.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 Again, he's here today.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 So we're so happy that he will also do a short breath.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 And then we are going to do a short breath in our own language.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 And then our neighbor, the Chichi monastery, again, is the monastery of his owner Chhezi Rummuji.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 He's one of the great masters of the 20th century in Tibetan Buddhism.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 I think also in the world, in the Buddhism world.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 He's been so famous to all our world.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 He was the supreme head of the numerous groups of Tibetan Buddhists.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 And this, again, he's a nephew, Chichi Ramya Rummuji.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 He's a keeping legacy and a vision of his wholeness, Tingong Chhenzi Rummuji.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 And now we're so happy that they have found a beautiful stew, but right here, beautiful mongs here.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 And they did a ceremony.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 So I'm so honored and happy that we all thank for Chichi, all of them.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 And how they really means to us and to follow all of us.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 And so we are going to do a short breath in our own language.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 And after that, then we have this dhana.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 And again, thank you very much.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 And that is the evening and what we're going to do.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 Thank you.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 Thank you.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 Thank you.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 Thank you.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 But this evening we will do a short breath in our own language.
