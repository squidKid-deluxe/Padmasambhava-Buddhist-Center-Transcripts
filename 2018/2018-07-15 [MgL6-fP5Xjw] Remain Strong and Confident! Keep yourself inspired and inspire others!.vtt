 "This time, for maybe one hour or whatever, we remain strong and confident. When we started

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:16.160
 lingering our attitude and thought, 'What is this mind?' That means we are in a pair, F-E-A-R,

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.710
 pair, doubt. Nothing is going to happen to anything. It's just the same thing, but we're activating

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.920
 our

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:28.320
 courage, our commitment, our confidence, so that we can really embrace the absolute nature of the

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:35.040
 Buddha Amitabha, same time, present the blessings and empowerment of our relative world. To do that

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.120
,

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:42.560
 we have to be confident, strong, courage, and determined. We pull up devotion and joy. That's

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:48.160
 what we're going to revere. And Amitabha is nothing, staying, anything. It is true love,

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:54.560
 compassion, versatile in our mind. We're going to revere that nature. So therefore, with those

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:01.280
 good, that motivation, and one only mind, and then join this place. So first, I will join,

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.120
 second, and then I do talk with you as a repetitionist.
