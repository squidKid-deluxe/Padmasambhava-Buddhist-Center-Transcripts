00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.440
 The school was full bloom of the Buddha who? That's what we thought, and for those reasons

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.400
 in the teaching, in the Nyingma schools of the Buddhism, we thought about nine Jana teachings,

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:21.080
 nine different levels of teachings, and not just even that, even before that, what would

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:29.960
 I give teaching? The teachings on the human beings and God's realms, teachings, that

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:37.920
 mean what? That means because the Buddha gives the teaching that can collect it to discover

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:48.280
 the higher potentials of each of their qualities to take the rebirth. In the human realms and

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:54.760
 as well as God's realms, those other teachings said in the Sanskrit world, I'm not really

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:04.200
 good at Sanskrit but in the U.S. world, manusha yana and deva yanas. Manusha is a human being

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:11.320
 and deva is God's yana. So that means what are those yanas? Those are basic goodness,

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:19.280
 that those goodness. For example, for example, chain rituals, telly by the, I'm not going

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:27.600
 to list, you all know that, telly by the body, pull by the speech, and telly by the mind,

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:36.080
 all together known as ten virtues. Ten virtues. Almost everything is ten non-virtues. That

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:46.520
 you know. Ten virtues is not just a kind of an exception to Buddhism. According to Buddhism,

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:54.600
 that is human, every human, decent human really believes, follow with that. That's what the

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:01.640
 Buddha taught. That is the foundation of all the teachings. Buddha teaching is best, best

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:08.560
 on the good concept, the good nature of the great things in the world and then improved

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:18.000
 or expanded, developed. So ten virtues. And then it's okay to be there, such as, and so

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.760
 with that, for example, those are parameters. Also, people do those. Even non-Buddhist has

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:34.400
 parameters, not transcendental parameters, but parameters. Those are known as also what

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:45.080
 are those parameters, of course, many of you already know, but generosity, morality, patience,

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:54.760
 and joyful effort, concentric, wisdom. Everyone believes those. Everyone do those. Everyone

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.920
 do generosity. Everyone do good conduct. Everyone talking, even the political talking conduct.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:11.080
 This really, this all that becomes so popular. It's morality. And then patience. Patience

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:21.760
 is also tolerance. Patience, or sorrow. And then effort. Effort is important. That is also

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:30.360
 magic. And then the concentric, let the mind from now talk to more mindfulness, all this.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:36.120
 And then wisdom, knowledge, understanding those. That's why the terminology exists into

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:45.840
 every country. Because they have that. It's human value. But Buddha teaching is more expanded,

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:52.520
 more stronger, more deeper. But when we have those good qualities of human beings, what

00:03:52.520 --> 00:04:02.800
 is the teaching said? Everything has a result, cause and result. It will bring higher rebirth

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:09.480
 in the next life. Even in this life, we will have good life, peaceful, more content, more

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:17.620
 kind of soothing lifetimes. And that result will have good rebirth in the next life. Not

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:24.920
 three lorems, but higher rebirths, such as human realms and God's realms. Those are

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:31.840
 really teachings. Those are known as the Rigulavas. Above that, then the teaching, what is teaching

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.840
?

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:39.960
 That's the only teaching. Then, such as Buddhism, above that, then the six paramatas practices,

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:47.360
 which we asked upon the transcendental paramatas practices. And then we do, those are, what

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:55.120
 mean? No ego clings or no attachment. And widely performing that. We do the discrimination

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:02.000
 of all those Buddha's instructors in the teaching management. Then it become high. And that

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.640
 goes higher and higher and deeper and deeper. And those are known as the Chhiavaka Jhanas,

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:16.920
 Parthi Buddha Jhanas. And as well as Bodhisattva Jhanas. It goes higher and higher and deeper

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:24.000
 and deeper. And also the realization of those different levels, such as in a human Jhana

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:32.040
 or the world, the good Jhanas, didn't really talk about any emptiness, anything. Nothing,

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:42.040
 but then in the Hatha Jhanas. Hatha Jhanas is egolessness. Those are the spiritual Bodhisattva

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:48.360
 Jhanas, egolessness. And well, Parthi Buddha Jhanas teaching, Manchini always teaches that

00:05:48.360 --> 00:06:00.880
 egolessness state of the subject and object, half of the object. I'm sorry, I think I mixed

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:08.040
 it up again. And in Parthi Jhanas, you have the realization of the emptiness of the object

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:18.280
 and subject is half of that. So there's always an emptiness realization of the one and half.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:24.480
 Then in the Mahayana teaching, then all the emptiness states. That's what it means. It's

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:34.380
 not just emptiness, completely blank states. And everything is taught teaching as two truths,

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:42.720
 two truths. Related truths are displays, illusion displays of the absolute truth. What related

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:54.520
 truth is the magic dream and reflection moon in the waters. And as well as the dream, those

00:06:54.520 --> 00:07:02.200
 are these related truths that exist, but our self, the regular duality of our self means

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:10.000
 clinging, grasping so strongly that reality it is really like illusions. Not just the

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:18.800
 object is illusion, but also mind is illusion. Subject and object are all illusion states

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:26.080
 in the relative levels. All are connected also so many factors, those are known as interdependent

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:32.640
 co-ordinations or interconnectedness or the aging revenue, I think the very word, the

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:41.600
 aging revenue of that, all arises. And each of those, then absolute level is in the empty.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:51.640
 Empty is beyond existence. All empty, there's nothing to hold. But yet it's appearing, therefore

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:58.640
 it's called magic display, dream-like disciplines. That is the Mahayana teachings. Really, of

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:04.640
 course, you all know, I'm just saying those things, I say they remind us to all about them.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:12.640
 In the Mahayana teachings, then that extended, not just only that, they're empty, but now

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:19.640
 in the teaching explaining, they are kind of enlightened states. Enlightened states,

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:27.640
 on them, not just empty, but all this display, related truths are enlightened states. They

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:35.640
 are like medallas, those are in the teaching state. And then we go to the inner dandalus,

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:45.640
 then they clearly explain song, poem is enlightened, song is enlightened, and the mind and the

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:53.640
 space are enlightened, absolutely. And then in the Dokki teaching, all is a display of

00:08:53.640 --> 00:09:01.640
 the origin and nature, very clearly, strongly, origin and nature of our mind. Each of our

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:09.640
 mind is created of a perception, of a conception. It's reflecting back. So that means, five

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:17.640
 outer gaps, all is a creation of each of our mind, of the origin and nature of the mind.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:26.640
 And that is creation. Mind is enlightened, therefore it is creation is enlightened states.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:34.640
 Those clearly explain. So among these teachings, that's what the great teacher Buddha taught.

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:41.640
 On a high level, in the teaching state, the teachings are taught as a staircase, staircase.

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:47.640
 All that staircase, there's nine staircase or nine steps, one up, but the first step,

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:54.640
 second step is dependent to the first step. Third step is dependent on the second step.

00:09:54.640 --> 00:10:00.640
 So is it dependent? And therefore, therefore, in the teaching state, said what? In the Dokki

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:07.640
 teaching, even, I mean, that's getting, what I remember somebody said in the teaching, said, true

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:16.640
 teachings of Dokki and students, even you have the highest realization, realization as a sky,

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:26.640
 vastness, realization as a sky, yet you will observe so thoroughly and carefully all the

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:35.640
 other levels. So we shouldn't, great practitioners should not ignore the conduct.

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:44.640
 Then we are disturbing our realizations and making completely kind of like contradictions

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:51.640
 and that really will make, then, delay our realization. So therefore, everything is enlightened

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:58.640
 in the United States, but yet follow the exactly the same as the way things are, externally,

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:05.640
 internally, and for that reason, great master, also Nagarjuna said, if you have the good

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:14.640
 conduct of the human beings, then heaven is not far. If you are in heaven, the enlightenment

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:22.640
 of the Nirvana is not far. So it's all connected, all dependent. If we have no good conduct,

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:28.640
 then we are falling back to samsara. Even you have some of the intellectual understanding

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:37.640
 of the teachings and practices that won't really support it. So that's how all is lined up.

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:44.640
 And now we go with this, this Dunyulumba's teaching, or this teaching we are going to

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:50.640
 talk about is Dzokhi teachings. And Dzokhi is, again, who taught this Dzokhi teaching?

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:57.640
 Again according to Buddhism, Buddha Shakyamuni taught these teachings, not in the regular

00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:07.640
 form, Buddha appeared in India, like as with bagging bowl and trunks bowl with that, that

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:15.640
 customs. Buddha, those who are high in the cupboard, reading this Buddha appeared in

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:21.640
 the Dharmakaya states, Buddha summoned the Buddhas, or Buddha read the Dada, or the

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:29.640
 various sattva states, and then transmitted this teaching through the retinues of the

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:35.640
 Aukhil language, retinue of the wisdom. Aukhil language, retinue of the wisdom, such as

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:46.640
 Ayana Buddhas, and as well as all those, how he taught, or how Buddha taught, not by the

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:55.640
 world, but not by the symbolism, by the wisdom state of the mind. My wisdom of mind, the

00:12:55.640 --> 00:13:05.640
 state of the mind transmitted without the word in the symbol everything. A word that

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:16.640
 chimi, tundu, unbound qualities, unbound qualities for the transmitting, meaning transmitting

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:28.640
 that teaching, those are known as mind-to-mind transmission, mind-to-mind transmission. Then

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:35.640
 also Buddha gave these teachings to the Sambhola levels against the five dhyana Buddhas. The

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:42.640
 Sambhola is also not just a kind of really big science, Sambhola is things, but with

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:52.640
 medically, through again some indications, and science, and transmitted teachings to

00:13:52.640 --> 00:14:02.640
 the five dhyana Buddhas, and such as then Vajrapanis, Manjushilis, and Avalokiteshoras,

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:10.640
 all those members. And that's what I have not transmitted. So those are known as mind-to-mind

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:18.640
 transmission, symbolic transmission. Those are the very special terminologies, not terminologies,

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:25.640
 special systems that are explained in the Inma teachings, and those are in the Gohyayangarva

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:32.640
 Center, or one of the Mahayoga Center known as Hiju Jamsal. And they said how they are

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:40.640
 transmitted by the mind, by the symbol, and by the ear, that's the meaning of those teachings.

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:47.640
 And then this order of transmission is then, for example, when that came, and it clearly

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:55.640
 teaching said, this Jokti teaching came 28 years after the Buddha's Chaturmunism happened

00:14:55.640 --> 00:15:03.640
 in the Rana, and then it started descending the Jokti teachings. Particularly, who discovered

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:09.640
 is the Garabdho ji, or Garabdho ji one who discovered or bought these Jokti teachings

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:17.640
 to this world. So then it's continued then, continued. And now the Jokti teaching itself

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:23.640
 is divided into three categories, and those are, of course, you all know, but I'm talking

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:30.640
 this as, again, two great teachers of the oldest lineage, lineage teachings. So therefore,

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:39.640
 again, this teaching came from the Garabdho ji, and Garabdho ji, the scholar, they were

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:49.640
 bought over 1,600 Jokti teachings that were bought. And then Garabdho ji's foremost student

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:57.640
 is Medhicharyamitra, and so he received all the teachings, and Medhicharyamitra divided

00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:02.640
 that Jokti teaching into three. Of course, you all heard this so many times and know

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:08.640
 that, maybe from me, and as well as other great masters, I'm sure. And those are known

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:16.640
 as them, and mind sections of Jokti teaching, and space, and beat instructions. Those are

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:25.640
 three divided. And Medhicharyamitra's foremost student is Hirisa. And Hirisa, again, received

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:34.640
 all the teachings, and he, again, subgrouped this teaching in four different ways, particularly

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:44.640
 of this beat instruction of the teachings. Those are known as outdoor, inner, and cigarette,

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:52.640
 and various cigarettes, so four different. And this time, what we are practicing in this

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:59.640
 Jokti teaching, of the Bdulilunga's teaching, and all the modern Jokti teaching, is really

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:07.640
 the beat instruction. Among that, not just beat instruction, the outer, inner cigarette,

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:13.640
 mostly essence. The more the essence section of the teaching, that's what we really want,

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:20.640
 the more we follow their teachings. This teaching is then divided into two groups. Those are

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:30.640
 known as tukkuk practices, and togal practices. We all heard that, tukkuk and togal practices.

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:41.640
 This teaching is then, where it is, those are known as, in the 17 Jokitantas, that explaining

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:52.640
 of these, the very sacred sections of these teachings. Jokki, Jukkubthu, which is, and

00:17:52.640 --> 00:18:01.640
 there is a second one, or third, another one, that, the eighth one, is known as Tantra of

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:07.640
 Ekajati, Ekajati teaching, and that. And the next one is known as the Kumsambharnam,

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:15.640
 great, blading space section of the Tantras. So those are total, the very powerful essence

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:21.640
 of the teaching of the 19 Tantras of this essence, of the essence of the Jokti teachings.

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:31.640
 These teachings are then translated into to be, in a time of the tesundetas, and who,

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:38.640
 and time of the Gaurupin Masambha, great master Shandaraki, who both, who, who actually then

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:45.640
 taught these teachings. According to the Jokit's historian, the three great masters taught

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:52.640
 first time this look, the inner thought, the essence of the S&T to the Tibetan practitioners,

00:18:52.640 --> 00:19:01.640
 three, by three masters. Those are known as, both is Verojana, the great oscillator, and

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:07.640
 the second is, is Gaurupin Masambha, and third is the Vman-Matthas.

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:13.640
 When they give teaching, for these Jokti teachings, particularly among that teaching,

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:20.640
 the first two, the mind and the space section, is particularly really taught by the Verojanas.

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:29.640
 And then, second one, and not second one, sorry, the fourth and second are taught by the Verojana,

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:37.640
 and be it as a talking section of the teachings and taught by the Varpim Masambha and Vman-Matthas.

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:42.640
 And those are, in the first time, Vman-Matthas give the teachings,

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:49.640
 teachings, not again, with big groups, small groups, Chasson Deppi, and Niyami Tungzi Zappo,

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:55.640
 or poor students who give the teachings. And then, Vrojana Masambha give this teaching

00:19:55.640 --> 00:20:01.640
 to Ishin Chodja and Chasson Deppi and his few sons. And particularly, he entrusted,

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:07.640
 one of the youngest daughter of the Chasson Deppi passed away when he was eight years old,

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:14.640
 but he brought back consciousness, and he trusted, he tiled this, the essence of the essence of it,

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:21.140
 the section of the Jokti teachings to him. To him. So he received that, and most of these are

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:22.640
 hidden as Dharma teachings.

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:28.640
 So that's how Jokti teaching transmitted, and then it came.

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:36.850
 And then, Barygolary later, great master Lunkiba, who was the emanation or the reincarnation of the

00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:37.640
 youngest daughter

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:44.640
 of the Chasson Deppi, who received the complete entire teaching of the essence,

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:48.640
 essence which is known as heart growth of the Dakini.

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:59.640
 Khandro Ninte, true to this youngest daughter, and Lunkiba discovered or received that in teaching.

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:07.490
 And then, Lunkiba is really known as the second Garab Dogi, or the obtibate, or Garab Dogi obtibate

00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:07.640
.

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:15.640
 He clarified, he convinced, brought everything perfectly in this section of the,

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:20.640
 complete instructions of the Jokti teachings to the students.

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:29.640
 Those are known as whole great Jokti teachings, or essence of Jokti teachings on Khandro Ninte.

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:36.140
 Those are, the first one is Khandro Ninte, which is the heart essence teaching of the Murpema Sambh

00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:36.640
ama.

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:43.640
 Second is known as the Bhama Ninte, heart essence of Murmata, which is again Jokti teaching.

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:50.250
 And then he meant the commentary, which is known as the second Rama Ninte, and Khandro Ninte is

00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:50.640
 true.

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:55.640
 And essence of that, condense of that one is known as the Sambhama Ninte.

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:58.640
 Those teachings are Khandro Ninte.

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:04.640
 And what those teachings, explaining, is Tu-Chu and Togga practices.

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:11.640
 Tu-Chu is cutting through the technique of course, and Togga is leaping over practices.

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:17.640
 These two add this, the essence of the Bhima Ninte and Srakram sections.

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:26.590
 Now, this Durya Nampa's teaching is Jokti teachings of the both, Tu-Chu and Togga teaching

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:27.640
 practices.

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:30.640
 This contains both of these teachings.

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:37.640
 And now, what I thought to do myself, and I'm going to go to all these teachings,

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:42.640
 the teachings of the, specifically of the Tu-Chu sections of these teachings.

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:53.500
 The proper section of the teachings is the seventh chapter, or the seventh section of this Shireg D

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:54.640
urya Nampa,

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:59.640
 of sharp, radiant awareness, and maybe I won't go over that.

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:03.640
 Because there are so many teachings of Togga teachings already,

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:10.280
 and I just feel that I don't have really the capability to do these Togga teachings on the internet

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:12.640
 in the Dzums.

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:17.640
 Even though I don't feel comfortable in the capability to give Togga teachings,

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:23.640
 but so many great masters are teaching, and I just also kind of follow me,

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:30.640
 and honor lineage, and honor to all the great masters of this order of those teachings.

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:38.300
 So I hope that I'm not making too much trespassing in going over really something totally out of

00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:38.640
 range.

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:45.640
 So I will try to do my best on these Tu-Chu part of the Togga teachings,

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:52.300
 but Togga part of the teachings of Togga teaching, as I said, I will be, I'm not going to talk over

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:52.640
 that.

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:59.640
 And as I said, I don't think, so I have capability to do this on the internet or the Dzums.

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:03.640
 So that you all know that. I'm just going to tell them.

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:09.640
 Now Togga practice of this, sorry, Tu-Chu practices, what did the teaching say?

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:12.640
 I'm talking, of course the teaching will explain.
