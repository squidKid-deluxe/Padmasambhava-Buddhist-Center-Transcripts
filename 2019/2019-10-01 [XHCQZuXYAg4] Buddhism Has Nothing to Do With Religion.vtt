00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 Thank you very much, everyone, for coming and for participating. Thank you, everyone. You are

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 welcome.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.280
 Again, we follow the teaching of the greatest teacher, the Buddha Shakyamuni. And so, again, for

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.000
 that reason, we should withstand that.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.790
 Again, as you said, we follow the teaching of the Buddha. But when we think of what the teaching is

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:29.000
, it's not something Buddha is talking, teaching, something that we don't have.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:39.440
 Buddha didn't say any standing things except what we have. And Buddha, that's what he said, "I'm

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.000
 the teacher."

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.950
 He said, "I'm a teacher. I'm showing you exactly what things are." That simple walk against

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.000
 teaching.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 That also means that we don't recognize what we have. We don't recognize many times.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 It's kind of naturally hidden for us. Even though nobody is hiding for us, nobody met that.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:15.970
 But naturally, due to our ego clinging, due to our emotion and duality, we are looking something

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.000
 completely opposite directions.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 Instead of looking to our own beauty and treasures. Buddha pointed out that treasures.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 And those treasures, what teaching, what we call what I said, Buddha, Buddhism, Buddha teaching.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 But reality is really teaching on the true love, compassion, worship.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:47.930
 It should be more joy, more respect, more friendship, and kind and complicated for all living

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.000
 beings.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 And being in that series, help to that. When you take that, and there is no ego, when you take that

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.000
,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 nothing has to do with religions of Buddha. Buddha himself said it.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 It's just somebody teaching, pointing out.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 This is all our richness, our inner, our glories, our goodness, our beauty, our treasures.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 And we revealed that this beauty, the richness, the treasures, it is absolutely good.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 100% is good for us, good for others. Good for every living beings.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 Not just the selected groups, these and that beings. All beings.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 That is good because all beings want the same thing, want happy, the joy, the peace.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 That is desire. That is their richness.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 That means somebody is calling deep, yearning to that river, that goodness.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 And again, looking someone along directions. Reality is with us.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 Love and kindness, compassion.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 To bring out that what the great teacher told, courage and commitment, confidence.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 And to begin to activate, to clarify more those, what it was, for example.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 Six bottom of that. Have you really think of six bottom of that?

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 It has nothing to do with the kind of tradition, it is good. 100% is good.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 It has nothing to do. It's also nothing strange, nothing alien, nothing foreign.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 It is our treasure, your treasure, my treasure, everybody's treasure.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 We are touching, reveling, we are strengthening, we are re-activating.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 That is what it is, really teaches.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 So therefore, when we practice the teaching, we should practice more, kind of more practical way.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 Not calmly, peaceful, sadder, don't, not kind of acting, hovering, this and that.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 That is ego.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 We deluded with that and we carried with the poles and we didn't leak anything.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 According to the British teacher, it's true.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:31.290
 It is good to be practical, more sensible, more practical, what is good for us, what is good for

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:32.000
 the others.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 And nobody is good for all the time, not just a short time, not just a small period of time.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 Not just a kind of having some kind of substances and make some happy and good short term

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 and they kind of fell down on the ground or fall down on the ground and they teach.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 That is not. We built up the strength and courage and goodness what we have.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 That is everlasting.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 Ever last of all these lives, everlasting on this, when we leave this world, everlasting

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 continually to the next lives.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 And that is what the great master, Chantideva said.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 When you ride the body's horse of the body each other, you are truly going to the joy,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 just from the joyful state to the joyful status, riding the horse of the body each other.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 You are going from joyful state to joyful status. Joyful state.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 Who else will be the kind of lady of the body each other?

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 That's what I said. It is good for us.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 Love of each other is love and compassion and worship.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 And it becomes a little more recent to come up a little brighter to the others too.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000
 It is not just only narrow corners. It is open in our heart.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 Nature is open. Beauty is open.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 Sky is open. Fire is open. Elements are open.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 Reality, everything is open. Open.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 And the sun is open. The moon is open. The air is open.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 In the same way, that is our nature is open.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 There is no boundaries. Regimental conception grasps me, creating all these boundaries.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 Reality is open, yet full of knowledge, understanding, practicals, all that.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 That's what it really is. So therefore, again, this strengthen our beauty with joy and appreciation

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000
.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 We are really how wonderful that now we find our treasures.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 Long, long term we ignore our treasure.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000
 Today by the greatest teaching, greatest teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni is teaching.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.000
 We are reconnecting that treasures. How wonderful, how beautiful it is.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 That is what we call joy and appreciation.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 In the same way, then the body can think.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 All means may I help today so that everybody can revere these beautiful, glorious riches.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 Really think of that. And that intention.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 And then also we are not just opening that joy and peace up.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 We like to revere the beauty, the pure purity of this.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 Those are very other teachings. All the purity, everything is the purity status.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 Again, that we didn't see because we did not discover, we realized that

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 until now, until the teaching of the Buddha Shakyamuni, because we looked.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 Looked. It's hiding with us.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 Many things are hidden. Even if it's right with us, we don't recognize.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 It's hidden. By the greatest teaching, it's open now.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 Open. So therefore, all those are beautiful and then now we go to this text.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 Again, this text of teaching is divided into three things.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 Big and good, middle good, and concluding good.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 This big and good, middle good, and concluding good is perfect, complete,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 the whole, complete techniques to reward our goodness for others.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 There's nothing in the teaching. There's nothing that needs more than three.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 And nothing less than these three.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 Big and good, middle good, concluding good.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 That's it. That's it.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 And we have less than this. Our practice is not complete.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 Not complete. So therefore, big and good, middle good, and concluding good.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 That you all know, I've mentioned many times, and I've been really all know.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 That is what's simple.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 And we've discussed that.
