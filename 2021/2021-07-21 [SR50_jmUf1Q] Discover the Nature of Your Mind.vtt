00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.410
 Thank you again, everyone. Thank you very much, everyone, for participating. Thank you. Thank you,

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:20.580
 Dalit. Thank you very much, everyone, for coming and for participating, as I said already.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:28.150
 Again, we're going to discuss the teaching of the Buddha. Actually, in the Buddha teaching, what is

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:38.270
 it? Studying, contemplating, and practicing, or meditating, those are we can uphold the teaching of

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:39.280
 the Buddha.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:49.230
 And that means that we will practice it, meditate it, actualize it, and truly, we are noble sammas,

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.680
 right? Sammas that we can do.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.580
 And this is also not just happening, right? It is hard, for accidental advice, just some kind,

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:05.160
 standing ways. But according to the teaching of the Buddha, it is truly very, very spacious and

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.280
 beautiful.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:12.690
 Why is it beautiful? Because we're not discussing anything, more than accepting our kindness,

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:22.280
 compassion, great joy and peace, happiness, to benefit for the beings and as well as ourselves,

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:28.280
 according to our best capabilities, that's what we're really discussing, that's what we're talking.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:35.420
 So then, what else? There's nothing better, more profound, more beautiful, more simple, more casual

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:44.040
, more basic than this. Therefore, we should feel happy, joy, what we're doing, what we're standing

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.280
 for, what we're trying to do, it's really wonderful.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:59.280
 According to Buddha's teaching and as well old brachanas, we're doing something remarkable in our

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.280
 life, taking that advantage of our beautiful, precious lives.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:08.010
 Life is precious, life is so important, as well everyone's life is important, precious. But we just

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:13.280
 regard it and neglect it without doing anything, then it's uninvestable.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:20.920
 We're not doing that, we're trying to release something, bring tangible meaning and a tangible

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.280
 result to benefit to ourselves, to all the beings.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:32.740
 This benefit is also not just only for short periods, we're going to be talking for a long time, it

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.280
's a parameter, it's forever.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:42.280
 Whatever we develop with our mind, it stays forever.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:59.330
 But whatever we develop externally, beside that, it's all just a question of how long it lasts, how

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.040
 long it lasts. But someday we develop with our mind, it really stays forever, this will become the

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.280
 stepping stones, so we can activate it, elevate it.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:15.620
 Bring more bright and more better, more good for ourselves, for the others, for forever. That's

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:21.400
 where we can get enlightenment, become the Buddha and discover our innate true nature as we will

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.280
 discuss.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:30.540
 So therefore, for that reason, we should feel happy in joy. But also we can generate, because our

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:37.400
 teaching, when we practice Adana, enlightenment is joy, enlightenment is peaceful, enlightenment is

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.280
 uplifting that we all know.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:48.690
 So therefore, why we not start right now? Happy, happy, joy, peaceful, really be more grateful with

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.280
 that, then follow the pole of the teaching.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:58.080
 Together with that, and as we discuss it, it's so important to have the motivation of the bodhicha,

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.280
 vastness motivation of the bodhicha for the living beings.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:08.840
 Really thinking sincerely, what I'm doing is to make this benefit for our living beings, for all

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:14.850
 living beings, from now and forever, to reach enlightenment, to perform all the suffering,

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.280
 difficulty, troubles.

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:24.320
 Even we think that one minute, or one second, the koda teaching is so powerful, it's so healing, so

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:33.280
 uplifting, really so uplifting, it's just so also purifying, cleansing, purifying our emotions God.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:41.140
 Or emotional convolution, like stains, whatever we have been, it will heal, purify, and it is very

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.280
 much the essential cause to reach enlightenment.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:52.790
 Together with that, and then, with the purely understanding, purely realizations, this is already

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:57.280
 an teaching, why also we should bring up the purely realizations.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:03.330
 And all those like three ways, as you all know, this is not just a kind of like talk in the left,

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:10.280
 and it's just kind of once and while we talk, those are our practice, what I'm discussing.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:22.510
 Of course we practice zuokin, but zuokin is best upon this. Zuokin is what called bodhicha, the

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.280
 absolute bodhicha, the absolute bodhicha, radiating relative bodhicha.

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:31.280
 So without this bodhicha, without this beautiful intention, there is no zuokins we will get.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:37.430
 We're just kidding ourselves, we like to something get zuokin practice, zuokin realization, we

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:43.770
 start leaving all things and we start kind of like grab the zuokin, that is which, kidding

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:49.280
 ourselves, we're pulling ourselves, really won't get any realization.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:06:00.260
 It's just like more, again, pull in a ditch, ditch of the duality, and all. So therefore, bring

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.280
 those all with realizations.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:08.130
 Then we follow that again, of course, zuokin teaching, as we follow. This is again, that's what we

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:14.510
're discussing, and now, again, I go over here and you all have this booklet, and we look to this

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:18.280
 booklet, as we left yesterday.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:30.950
 And this is, I think we'll make it up to here, as well as in this page 11, I think, page 11,

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:46.070
 according this booklet, as well as in the spring week of the mantra yana, whichever part you follow

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.280
, establishing the rules, that's what we, I think we talked.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:54.620
 Here, Great Master Mooji mentioned, whichever you follow, that means, there is according, generally

00:06:54.620 --> 00:07:03.290
, there is three, or three inner tantrums, or three, there is tantra teaching, which has divided

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:08.280
 into three outer tantra, three inner tantrums.

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:17.360
 Whichever you follow, or even zuokin teaching, you have to establish the rules. It's not just only

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.280
 the very inner teachings, you have to establish the rules.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:29.610
 And not just only zuokin, that again, Mahayana zuokin, but also even in the L.A., the Persian

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:34.280
 Buddhist school, we have to establish the rules.

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:40.280
 That is what we're going to practice. Practice means you're keeping up the rules.

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:47.780
 So therefore, we have to, whichever you establish, particularly in Vaidyana teaching here, Great

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:56.010
 Master Mooji says, whichever you follow here, as well as in the supreme weekals of the mantra yanas

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:58.280
, supreme weekals of the mantra yana,

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:13.100
 there is like three supreme weekals of the mantra yanas. Those are known as maha yoga and anu yoga

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:16.280
 and ati yoga.

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:25.590
 It's also our role, the familiar role. We've all heard so many times. According to the new schools

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:31.280
 of Buddhism, they use terminology most of the time,

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:37.280
 according to teaching, pada tantra, mada tantra, and neutral tantrums.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:45.550
 Reality I heard from the teachers and as well as from the teaching is basically the same. There's

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:46.280
 no big difference.

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:53.280
 So whichever follows you, whether you follow the maha yoga teaching or anu yoga teaching,

00:08:53.280 --> 00:09:01.470
 all those pada tantra names, all Mahamudra follows, all the Mademakas, all are inseparable of the

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:03.280
 path and the result.

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:13.280
 Those are the Sajja schools of Buddhism. Whichever you follow, we have to have a tangible view.

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:28.500
 That means you have to have a tangible view. Again I use a tangible word, but we have to connect to

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:32.280
 the view without any hesitation.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:40.280
 Without a doubt, we will have to be confident. Have to be confident.

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:47.280
 As I said yesterday, we're not practicing this practice of zho khi chee chee with the belief.

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:54.240
 Of course, there may be two different ways of confidence, or I believe, therefore I have confidence

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:55.280
 sometimes.

00:09:55.280 --> 00:10:02.280
 But this time, zho khi meditation is not believing.

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:08.280
 This rapa, when you establish it, we have to have confidence.

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:21.280
 That means whenever I practice zho khi meditation, I have to have confidence what I'm meditating.

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:33.570
 When you meditate on zho khi chee, you have to know, you have to have the confidence what you're

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:35.280
 meditating.

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:46.280
 Otherwise, if we don't have the confidence on the view, then our meditation becomes almost awake,

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:49.280
 presumptuous.

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:57.280
 And just a kind of a blurt, that is not in this case.

00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:02.280
 Even though it's good, we're trying, but this is not good.

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:14.280
 For that reason here, establishing the confidence we would see as it is.

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:21.780
 That we discussed yesterday, and of course, you all know, there are so many teachings, so many

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:23.280
 books.

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:29.280
 So many books we read on the zho khi chee teachings, we discussed.

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:36.550
 This person, this conception, thinking of this might be, or looks like, I feel good, or it's really

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:37.280
 good.

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:45.280
 It's all good, but all is conception. All is mind.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:51.280
 What great teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni, said yesterday, I said, from our Apsar Sotaras,

00:11:51.280 --> 00:12:00.280
 "The enlightened nature is right with us, but the conceptions are governed."

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:10.280
 Conception. Conception is duality. Conception is the obscuration system.

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:21.060
 Conception is emotion. And the zho khi chee teachings name conception as same thing, Rupa Shakyam

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:21.280
uni,

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:29.280
 with very famous terminologies. Mind and Rupa. Conception is mind.

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:38.280
 All too. Conception is also relative truth. Conception is relative truth.

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:46.280
 We have mind. We're thinking now. This is conception.

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:53.280
 But we're not meditating into conception. We're not keeping it. That is not zho khi.

00:12:53.280 --> 00:13:01.280
 Who's there for? Here, great Master Muharramar said, said, "You have to establish."

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:08.280
 Then we went yesterday according to Madhima, saying, "You know, you received so many teachings,

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:14.280
 but all these teachings that you received from so many great Masters, reading books, all that,

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:21.280
 we all pray, we all hope it will clip that, "Oh, who?" Something that we find.

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:28.790
 That's what it was called. In many times, the teachings said, "We hope, we really, all these

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:29.280
 teachings

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:38.160
 and all these reading the books will hook our awareness to the ring of the womb. Really hook up

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:39.280
 this.

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:48.940
 Hook that. I hope it will clip, clip." So in order to do that, yesterday we went according to Madh

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:50.280
ima schools.

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:59.280
 Where did this mind come from? On the relative level, we have mind. Nobody can ignore.

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:06.280
 We have right now. That's what we're thinking. We're discussing. We're communicating.

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:13.280
 We're verbally talking. Maybe also you're listening.

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:23.280
 This is all really mind. Mind, of course, as we call listening by the ears, reality is mind.

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:29.280
 Or maybe now more than a time, it's brains. Brains.

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:38.280
 But this time, we're not meditating on the brains. We're not meditating on what we heard.

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:43.280
 Song, hearing. We're meditating the nature of that.

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:48.280
 Find out of nature, we're going to relax.

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:53.280
 We mean why we have to be there. Why we have to meditate on the nature?

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:58.280
 Because we've been carried by this mind, by this conception.

00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:07.280
 According to the Buddha's teachings, from the biggest times, all the time is carried.

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:12.280
 And they're carried out all the time. We're looking all the time out.

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:19.280
 Looking, listening, all going, thinking, hoping, all these activities.

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:28.280
 Really, it's all out, out, out. But what do we mean? What do we got?

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:37.280
 Fundamentally, what I'm talking, that we all need happy, peaceful, calm, soothing.

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:42.280
 Pretty from a cure in the teaching, always, pretty from doubt and hesitations and emotions.

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:46.280
 But we never thought it. Never thought it.

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:53.770
 No matter how much we are smart, how much we are rich, how much we are culpable to do so many

00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:54.280
 things.

00:15:54.280 --> 00:16:02.270
 But still, that we are loaded, saturated, completely sorrow, and revive the emotions of these

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:04.280
 conceptions.

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:10.280
 Today, we're trying to make the change, something change to this.

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:20.280
 So there, we're going to find out where this doubt, this mind is coming from, where it is.

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:29.280
 We went yesterday. It's not something that you know only we discussed yesterday. You all know.

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:40.280
 But we find out, this mind is controlling every aspect that we know, every aspect of our lives.

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:50.940
 It's a big boss, big CEO, CEO, really. More than CEO, it controls every activity, every our

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:58.280
 movement, every our thinking, our activity, performance every day.

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:10.720
 It's true. You ask yourself, it's true or not. But we hate this mind. It's behind the scenes,

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:12.280
 completely.

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:20.280
 So therefore, we find out this nature. This, that is what we call nature.

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:27.780
 Therefore, the greatest teacher in the lineage masters, and the Gopin Massama, they taught those to

00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:29.280
 discover.

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:35.280
 These are tangible questions, very accurate questions we always get.

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:43.180
 We have this person's mind. But where this mind comes from? By the existing, it's produced the

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:44.280
 existing.

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:52.070
 It's produced the mind. Our present mind is produced by something existing, from something existing

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:53.280
 or non-existing.

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:56.280
 Neither and either we discussed those yesterday.

00:17:56.280 --> 00:18:04.280
 When we are investigating, there is no answer. There is nothing that you can find at all.

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:13.280
 That is known as, in the teaching, also I call the Doki teaching, we are making division between

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:16.280
 conception of the mind and the raka.

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:27.360
 Raka is free from every conception. When you discover that nature, when you see that, that is what

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:31.280
 you see, the greatest things, obvious things.

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:40.010
 That is really nature. Believe it or not. Maybe we are thinking, oh, we like to, nature might have

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:44.280
 to, I like to find something that I can hold.

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:57.890
 Realitally, there is nothing really to hold. It's beyond, what is it? It's also not negation status

00:18:57.890 --> 00:18:58.280
, negation status.

00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:06.580
 For those reasons, in the Doki teaching, what I said, Raka is always in the four great liberated

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:13.280
 states, four great liberated states. Always.

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:22.410
 It's not just newly developed. Always. Those who are liberated, of course, you know, you heard this

00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:25.280
 many times and we practiced.

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:31.280
 And I will list the names and then go the meaning of that, each of those.

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:45.280
 So, the first is liberated organically. In a debate, yedore, yedore, yedore, organically liberated.

00:19:45.280 --> 00:20:04.500
 And the second is mandor, self-liberated. And the third is yedore, yedore, negative liberated, or

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:09.280
 fresh, maybe, yedore, fresh.

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:26.060
 F-R-E-S-H, fresh, liberated, liberated. And port is tadron, and liberated from every sport, maybe a

00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:33.280
 translated sport, S-P-O-T, any sport.

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:45.280
 So that, Raka is always in that status, what we behold, what we discover through the investigation.

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:53.080
 Generally, in meditation, Doki teaching, there is two ways of meditating. Those are known as in

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:54.280
 teaching.

00:20:54.280 --> 00:21:03.280
 Teaching says, chegung and jogung. Chegung means meditating by the analytics.

00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:15.200
 You meditate by the, what you gain, by the analytically meditating by analytically, analytically in

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:16.280
 that.

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:26.280
 Second is meditating easy approach, easy approach. What we are doing now is easy approach.

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:35.380
 Analytic meditation is all those great philosophers, great scholars, studying, contemplating, and

00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:38.280
 then they start meditating in the practice.

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:45.780
 Still they need instructors. According to the teaching, even they vaguely know all that analyt

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:49.280
ically, but receive the final instruction.

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:56.280
 That that, the lineage teachings, you need blessings, lineage blessings. Then they meditate.

00:21:56.280 --> 00:22:05.280
 We are doing as an easy approach, meditating. So there, even though it is easy, but still because

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:07.280
 we need confidence to the will,

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:13.280
 therefore we met with those easy analytics.

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:20.280
 And then, the other one, yesterday, I also met, those are in the teaching said, find out the mind

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:24.280
 by the, by tuning in, go some in a little bit.

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:31.550
 Where is it coming from? Where one comes from? Where is now? Where is gone? By that, find out the

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:36.280
 mind, mind, or nature of the mind.

00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:43.280
 So now, we find our rukkah is, this mark rukkah, which is free from the conception, is
