First, the channels need to be properly aligned by maintaining good posture. The main points of good posture are known as the seven-point posture of Buddha Vairochana. If you use these postures when you meditate, your meditation will be stable and smooth.\" (pg 55 1st paragraph)\n\n2.  \"There is a particular Dzogchen technique for breath purification that releases the inner air of the negative emotions. The three main emotions, often called the three poisons, are attachment, anger, and ignorance. By releasing the air connected with the three poisons you can clarify your wind energy. ... Doing this exercise will help to clear the air of the emotions. When the emotion air is dispelled, at that moment wisdom air will appear more clearly. After doing this exercise to purify the breath, your mind will be clearer and calmer, and it will be easier to maintain your mind in the meditative state.\" (pg 57 1st paragraph, pg 58, last paragraph)\n\nImportant Concepts and Terms\n\nEquanimity means an attitude of impartiality. If you practice loving-kindness and compassion, you will easily have a joyful attitude that will help you develop natural balance or equanimity. You will not make arbitrary discriminations between people, or groups of people, or any sentient being. Every single living being is part of our family and one of our best friends. ... Your practice of love and compassion, as well as your joyful attitude, is to be shared equally with all sentient beings, like sunlight radiating in all directions. On a deeper level, whatever we experience in this world doesn't really exist in a solid or substantial sense. It merely exists in a dreamlike way. When you naturally perceive and experience things in this manner, you will not cling or hold onto any attitudes at all. Everything appears like a rainbow or the reflection of the moon in water. You unceasingly perform activities to benefit all sentient beings without any attachment. This is known as the state of great equanimity. If you start clinging to love, compassion, and joy, you become very territorial. Your understanding can't become immeasurable. It won't even become very open. The practice must be applied with an impartiality free of ego-clinging, yet continually expanding and intensifying.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.880
 Hello, thanks for joining us. This is the 11th broadcast of the PBC Morning Dawn study group from

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:14.000
 Padmasamyaleng in New York, the Venroble-Khenpo Rinpoches retreat and monastery here.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.560
 So today we'll be discussing Chapter 11 of the Kenpo Rinpoches book "The Buddhist Path", which is

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.000
 entitled "Meditation, Posture, and Breath Purification".

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 So we'll just do brief opening prayers first, and then we'll begin our discussion. Thanks again.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 (Music)

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:13.550
 Samantavadra, Bhadrasattva, Pramodavadra, Sri-signa, Dhammakara, the 25 king subjects, Sosur, Nuh,

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.530
 Nyeong, and the 100 Chertans and others, the Lamas of the Kama and the Tamil lineages to you, I

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:18.000
 pray.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.920
 The supreme tradition of the glorious Buddha Padmasambhava, which is the essential, extraordinary

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.760
 view and doctrine of the early translation school, you keep alive and spread by the light of wisdom

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.000
, Lord of Dharma, great Kenpo, I pray it shall always speak.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.770
 In the palace of the old man Dharmadhātud, the essence of all the Buddhas of the three times, the

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.740
 one who shows clearly the Dharmakāya of my own mind, you pray to the honourable Rūkuru, glorious

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.720
 Rū teacher, precious one, while laying on the lotus seed and the crown of my head, hold me with

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:58.000
 your great kindness and slowly accomplishments of body, speech, and mind.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 Om Maravasanādhi, Om Maravasanādhi, Om Maravasanādhi,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 Om Maravasanādhi, Om Rūkuru.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:50.300
 So we begin chapter 11 on page 55. This is meditation, posture, and breath purification again. And

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:59.000
 I'll just quickly do a brief summary of Rinpoche's teaching in this chapter on the posture section.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.650
 So in the beginning, the first paragraph, Rinpoche say that when meditating, it's important to keep

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.880
 the body, speech, and mind balanced, and that the body has these three components, channels, wind,

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.000
 and essence element.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 And by keeping these three components balanced, then the mind itself will be balanced as well.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:26.110
 Then secondly, when the channels are aligned, then the wind is aligned, and then the mind is

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.000
 aligned, and we can do this mainly by maintaining a good posture to keep the channels straight.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.930
 And Rinpoche's go over the seven point posture of Bhutavaracana, and these are essential

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:43.000
 instructions for how to have this straight posture.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 So the first instruction is to cross your legs in the lotus or vashra posture.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 And second, to keep the back span straight like an arrow pointing up to the sky.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:02.410
 Thirdly, it's about the position of one's hands. Either there can be any equanimity mudra, or you

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.000
 can rest your hands on your knees with palms down.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 Fourthly, to keep the elbows, your elbows rounded without touching them to your sides.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:21.030
 Fifth, to keep the neck straight. Six, to have your eyes looking forward and down towards the tip

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.000
 of your nose without blinking or moving your eyes too much.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 And then seven, to have your tongue touching the roof of your mouth with your lips slightly parted.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.940
 So in the chapter there's really specific instructions for each of these points, but this is just

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.000
 like the bullet points of those.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 So then we'll go to this first discussion point.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 This is page 55, the first paragraph.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 When meditating, it is always important to keep your body, speech, and mind balanced.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 The body has three principal components, the channels, the wind, and the essence elements.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 If these three components are well balanced, you will feel healthy and comfortable.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 First, the channels need to be properly aligned by maintaining good posture.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000
 The main points of good posture are known as the seven-point posture of vudavarachana.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 If you use these postures when you meditate, your meditation will be stable and smooth.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:38.180
 I had a question about how they say that the body, speech, and mind are related to the channels,

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.000
 the wind, and the essence element.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 Just wondering what you all think about how speech is related to wind.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 What do you think about that?

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.300
 Here we can definitely see that body, speech, and mind are something that we all share, all

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.000
 sentient beings.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 Body is the grossest, most apparent level.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 Mind is the intangible, formless, subtle, most subtle, non-apparent level.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:24.000
 In between is this fluid, flexible, subtle level, which is speech, or wind.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 All sentient beings have body, speech, and mind.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:35.830
 Wind is, in one way, what connects the outer to the innermost, or what connects this apparent gross

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:37.000
 level phenomena,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 what provides the moving energy, and then connects it to this formless, intangible mind.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
 So then, how speech is related with wind.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 I mean, I think there's a lot of instructions, and it's a big topic.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:59.370
 But it's that movement component, and sometimes it's related with circulation in the body, or resp

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:00.000
iration.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:15.320
 They say the breath is like wind, or like the outer wind that we see, like we think of wind in the

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.000
 air.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 And then, similarly, maybe speech is like the air moving in our body, so then we can call it wind.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:31.870
 And also, they say, too, in general, it's a movement of the mind, actually, that gives rise to

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:33.000
 speech.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 Based on a subtle movement in the mind, that's the wind, actually.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 It's the moving.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 So all the syllable is actually wind.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 That's why they say, I mean, it is a huge big topic, but from the unborn "ah" syllable,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 which they say is the basis of all the other syllables, and also represents the nature,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 there's like a stirring of movement, or wind, and that, basically, they say,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:15.680
 actually, all speech is the syllables, it's a symbolic movement of syllables that are imbued with

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:16.000
 meaning

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:22.010
 based upon the subtle movement of wind in the body, through the channels, that's manifest

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:23.000
 externally.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 So it's really interesting because words, thoughts, concepts are all a stirring of wind in the mind

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:33.000
,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:44.000
 which gives rise to moves through the channels and comes out as a verbal symbolic sound

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 that has meaning based upon language and all these other things.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:54.270
 So it's like mind, it's like the subtle stirring of mind manifests, that's the, that would be, you

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:55.000
 could say,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.490
 I mean, if we broke it down into the, again, it's a huge topic, but the central channel would be

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:01.000
 the mind,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:07.000
 or the dharmakaya, the white channel, because we saw this in the previous chapter too,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 the white channel would be the nirmanakaya, or the channels would be the nirmanakaya,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 the white channel would be the nirmanakaya, the red channel would be the subogakaya,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
 and the blue central channel would be the dharmakaya,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:31.000
 and from the unborn dharmakaya aha syllable comes the manifestation of speech,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 which is the more subtle subogakaya form emanating as nirmanakaya, letters and sounds.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.710
 So it's really, anyway, I just thought that's what I was actually looking at before we started this

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:46.000
.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 It's just interesting, I hadn't thought of it at all that way until you said it,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:58.500
 but thinking about how as the mind moves, like of course, I mean we know our minds are moving in so

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:00.000
 many varied ways,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:06.000
 so if we picture the mind as a sphere, and like it's being moved,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 and what happens generates different changes in the wind, and then that produces a different sound.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:25.350
 I mean you could say it like a sound, it's almost just like the wind takes different shapes based

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:27.000
 on how the mind is moving.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 Could you say it that way?

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:38.030
 In the channels, like in the previous chapter when we talked about, humans have such a particular

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:40.000
 structure of their channels,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:46.130
 and winds and essence elements, that's why we perceive things different from like an ostrich or

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:47.000
 something else

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
 that has a different configuration of channels.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:03.000
 But they definitely, like it comes back to this whole balanced point,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:11.000
 like if the channels are balanced, the wind won't be balanced, the wind's not balanced,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 the speech won't be balanced, and the mind won't be balanced either.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:22.980
 That's why it's good to start with this more outer level, which is the posture, you know, getting

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:24.000
 the proper posture.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 I mean they did talk about that a little bit in that last chapter,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:33.000
 getting the right posture really automatically sets things up for the winds to flow more smoothly,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 and then because the winds are flowing more smoothly, then the mind will be more settled,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:48.000
 and clear in all the different things that it can be, that aren't disturbed basically.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:54.660
 Or karmic, so they make that in the previous chapter 10, the big distinction between two types of

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:55.000
 wind,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 karmic wind and wisdom wind.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 Another way they talk about it is impure wind that's influenced by our grasping of mind,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:14.000
 or pure wisdom energy or wisdom wind, which is the natural, calm way that our mind functions

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 and expresses itself when it's really balanced, when it's in it, when it remains in its nature,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 then that mind expresses itself with wisdom.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 And so it's good just to highlight again that distinction, this karmic wind versus wisdom wind,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 because like they move differently depending on if it's a karmic wind or a wisdom wind,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.410
 but what about it is different, and it's definitely, like you said, related to what is it moving

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:40.000
 through,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 the channels, and then where is it coming from, is it coming from, so if we go to the outer,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 we see the channels which influence the movement, or if we go more from the inner,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 we see our mind, is it really balanced, and thus the expression is really wisdom,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 or is it really disturbed or unbalanced, and then the expression is really scattered

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:11.000
 and kind of tightened and twisted in various ways that our karmic habitual patterns do and emanate.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:21.270
 I have a question about this. So I think it's good to know about how the posture influences the

00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:22.000
 channels

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
 and then how that influences the mind.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
 As a beginning meditator, I don't have any experience of any of that.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:37.000
 So I'm wondering if there's a different way you could think about the posture,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 maybe exercising mindfulness, being mindful of what posture you are in,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 and then noticing when you lose it and go back into it and engage that process.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 I think your question hits on a lot of really special points.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 Say we received an instruction from our teacher, and they said, "Sit this way."

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000
 But they didn't say anything about why. They just said, "Do this."

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:12.000
 This is the way my teacher taught me, and now I'm just going to repeat the thing

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
 because that's what I've learned and it's worked.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 So even if we don't know really why it works, there's still a lot of merit

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 in receiving a particular instruction, a course from these great Realized Masters,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
 and then just applying it. Even if we have no idea, I haven't even heard anything about

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
 wins or channels or anything like that.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:38.000
 And I think in a lot of comparative traditions, it's like that.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000
 In the beginning, here we are in Chapter 11 of this book,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000
 so the River Chases have already covered quite a bit of ground.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 In the beginning, if you were to meet a teacher and they're like,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:57.000
 "Get a big explanation about why you just need to sit on your cushion with a straight back,"

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 then for a lot of people it would be overwhelming and uninteresting

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
 and probably would cause them to not want to sit that way at all.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.000
 It could be.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 But here we are kind of little midway through, at least this book,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000
 and so they're kind of filling in a little bit of the "why"

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000
 with at least, and this is so subtle, like this is such a subtle level of topic.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 I mean, just the way the outer really, how does it really connect with

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 or interface with the innermost of mind?

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 But that's just one thing that comes to mind.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:35.000
 Even if we don't know why it works, there's still an instruction that's very practical.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 Like you sit this way, cross your legs this way, hold your hands in this way,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000
 straight back, neck, and if we do it, regardless of whether or not we know why

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 it helps us feel balanced or unbalanced, it will still have that effect.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000
 If it actually is relating to this subtler level,

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000
 that actually is influencing the movement on that level.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 And that's what I think, in terms of your question,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 I think you have a lot of experience with this, actually.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000
 A lot of experience with how posture affects mind states,

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
 like, even for example, working on a computer, or which we all do,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
 there's the posture, there's the iPhone posture.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 That's like, but you know, it's like, if you're working on the computer every day

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
 and you have good posture and you sit up straight and you have more ergonomic,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000
 even though that's slightly different, but you know that at the end of the day,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000
 you'll feel better, you won't have as much prone to aches and pains,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 doing that over and over again.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 I think it's similar, too, because your channels are more balanced,

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:48.000
 and same as, if Kepo Saewong, he said fairly recently,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 "Oh, like, for example, if we sit in front of the TV eating, what did he say, Doritos?

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 We look like a refrigerator."

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 He said, "If we're doing that, obviously, you know,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:07.000
 like, this is the samadhi of eating chips and watching TV, which we, you know, definitely, we do."

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 But anyway, how that affects the, you know, that affects one's state of mind,

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 that affects one's, you know, samadhi.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
 And just, like, that seems to bring it around to what you asked,

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 which was, it affects your state of mind, and I mean,

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.000
 I think for many, most of us, like, sitting eating chips in front of the television,

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:33.000
 it's like mindless, you know, there's just a certain level of dullness that's going on there.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:38.000
 The thing for people is relaxing, and it's just some way of, like, it can be fun and relaxing,

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 but I think in terms of the mind, like, it's just pretty, like, low level, you know.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 But so then, paying attention to posture is a great way of being mindful,

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 and I think it's, like, one of the things that sort of happens automatically,

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:57.000
 as, I think, as a beginner, definitely, and I mean, continually, through your own path.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 So, I mean, I would think, yes, it's a great way to work on mindfulness,

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000
 it's just kind of holding proper posture.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.900
 And it's, I think, really directly related to Buddhist teachings on four foundations of mindfulness

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:12.000
.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
 That's what I was thinking, too.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:20.000
 So we need, if we're having, if we're focusing on something or concentrating on something,

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
 that the outermost one is, of course, phenomena, objects,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 and then the little more inner is body, our own body.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 Then the little more inner is the physical sensations going in our body.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:37.530
 And then the innermost is our own mind, being mindful of our own mind, our ideas, our thoughts,

00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:38.000
 emotions.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 The easiest thing to focus on is outer objects, which we're all doing all the time,

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.000
 but not really with much mindfulness, with a lot of grasping, we don't want that, don't want that.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.050
 But then if we bring it in more to our body, like you said, it can be an exceptionally profound

00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:54.000
 meditation technique.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 I mean, it was one of the essential techniques that Buddha Shakyamuni taught.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:05.000
 Just over and over again is like a foundational practice for the entire path of liberation,

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
 like that mindfulness of body.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000
 Even if you didn't mention anything about why, in terms of having certain postures,

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:19.000
 just literally intentionally placing our posture, or doing gestures, or moving with a certain

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:19.000
 awareness

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000
 of what am I doing now, staying in the present moment in that way,

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000
 then it's an exceptionally profound technique that's very practical, very pragmatic,

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000
 and you don't even have to mention anything about this more subtle level,

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 this more inner tantra level with the winds.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.420
 But you don't really miss out on anything in the sense of, if you're sitting as the Buddha

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:40.000
 instructed,

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:47.000
 and it doesn't give more of the intellectual side in a way of why it works, why it's helpful,

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 but you actually perform it, you engage it, you practice it, then the benefit's still there.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.000
 Because it's so much more profound, which is very clear to say, to actually apply the instruction,

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.000
 to actually perform it, to meditate, that's what it's all leading towards.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000
 And then if we understand why intellectually, that can be helpful when we get in trouble,

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000
 we get confused, or if we want to communicate to someone else,

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000
 then it's good to have a clear intellectual understanding.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.000
 But like, cooking food is the whole point, and knowing menus and stuff is important,

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000
 but to actually cook the food and eat it is the point.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 So in this way, it's very practical.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 We're taking the medicine.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000
 Yeah.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000
 They say, when you do the mantra of repetition, "Oh, what does this mean? What does that mean?"

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.520
 They said, "Well, if you take the pill, you know, you don't need to know all the different

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:35.000
 ingredients.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000
 It could relieve your allergies, you know.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000
 Even if you don't know what the different ingredients are."

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 So it is similar. I like that metaphor a lot, because it makes a lot of sense.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 It doesn't mean that it's not good or helpful to know exactly how,

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.000
 but like, for example, one of the seven points is, like, keep the eyes still, you know,

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000
 open in a certain way, or focused in one direction.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.000
 That's something that there's ancient teachings says so much, you know.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:12.000
 Like, wherever your eye looks, the tendencies are so strong to grab for the mind to follow

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:18.000
 where the movement, so it's a movement of the wind that's making everything move anywhere,

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000
 like all the movement in your body, too.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000
 And it's connected with the movement of the mind.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.000
 So if you're, especially for a beginner, if your mind is, you know,

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 if your body is moving a lot, then it tends to mean, you know,

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.000
 if less you have some degree of stability, then your mind is moving a lot, too.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:44.000
 And focused on, like, oh, you know, like, just on those four foundations,

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:49.000
 just on the objects instead of, like, the subject.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:55.000
 Especially considering that they say the, you know, like in a previous chapter

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.000
 when they talked about the channels of the winds and the essence elements in more detail,

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000
 how our whole experience is caught up with these things.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 We can't really separate us, our sense of, you know, self, in a way,

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.850
 from the channels and the winds and essence elements, because that's the way we perceive everything

00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:15.000
.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:21.000
 Even they say in the previous one, like, the white channel is more associated with appearance.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000
 The red channel is more associated with emptiness.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.000
 And then, "wind" is oftentimes, they say, if that had a location, a central channel, wisdom,

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000
 wisdom mind would be in a central channel.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000
 So, it's totally related with this.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 I mean, even though they don't, in the previous chapter,

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000
 Rinpoche has talked more about that.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 But like Drachwa was saying, with, like, the karmic habit patterns,

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000
 like, oh, the karmic winds, you know,

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 it's just, like, almost totally overshadowed our wisdom.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000
 Like, our wisdom winds of our actual, you know,

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 basically the central channel of the, in the heart center, oftentimes they say this.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000
 There's many different ways of seeing the central channel as the nature itself,

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000
 as the nature of mind, all these different things.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000
 But everything's dispersed through the other channels,

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000
 especially the red and white channels.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 So, the breath purification totally helps expel all that karmic dualistic movement

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000
 that's continually going through those channels all the time,

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:31.000
 and overpowering, completely overpowering the wisdom that's sparking all the time, too.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000
 Because it's just moving throughout the channels, and all the knots,

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:40.000
 and the channels are all messed up, and the movements are all duality-minded.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000
 So, by explaining the stale air, like, someone told me a story, too.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.000
 They said, when, when Rinpoche's father, Lama, Lama Cune,

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000
 I think when he was maybe in the hospital,

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000
 but, and he woke up to do practice, like, in the late at night,

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 and immediately he does this exact breath purification that they say.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000
 And they said they were so surprised because they thought,

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.460
 "Oh, but that's like, kind of like a beginner technique, or, you know, why, you know, it's not that

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:08.000
 big a deal."

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000
 But they said he always did that.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.000
 And so many great masters, they all do that.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 When they wake up in the morning, before they go to sleep, you know, like,

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:23.000
 spell the duality winds from the body just exactly like they talked about here, you know.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:28.000
 Because otherwise, you have all this stale duality, you know,

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:34.000
 karmic wind that's overshadowing your natural, I mean, wisdom wind, you know.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.000
 So, it's such a powerful technique, you know.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:43.000
 And we shouldn't think that it's not important, but we're just, you know, beginners thinking this.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.000
 And so, maybe we'll go into this second section on this more breath purification instructions

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000
 at Kemmer Rinpoche's game.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000
 And the really brief summary is that Rinpoche say,

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:58.000
 "After balancing one's body, the next is to balance the breathing or wind."

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:03.000
 And so, during meditation in particular, the instruction is just to breathe normally.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.000
 But then they say, "Before beginning your morning practice session,

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:12.000
 after doing at least three prostrations and sitting in this correct posture that they describe,

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:17.000
 then they ask us to do a breath purification to release the negative karmic winds

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.000
 related to our three poisons of ignorance, attachment, and anger.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:27.000
 And then also, this helps us to recognize and cultivate this wisdom wind that we have.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000
 And so, the point of the breath purification is that we're clearing out our channels

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000
 of all the impure, unbalanced wind energies

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 so that our natural wisdom mind energy will naturally circulate throughout our body.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 And then, we won't go in particular to the exact instructions of it,

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000
 because they're really so clear in this chapter.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000
 And we're welcome if there's questions and we talk.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:54.000
 But really, for the exact instructions, just read the chapter. It's the best.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000
 When Rinpoche say that, "Once our channels and winds are more balanced,

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:04.000
 then our mind naturally settles more easily, becoming more calm and clear and fresh."

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:10.000
 And that these preparations of setting our posture into good, balanced posture,

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.000
 clearing out the stale, karmic winds,

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000
 we're kind of recognizing or activating our wisdom winds,

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:23.000
 these are all essential preparations for inviting our own natural intelligence,

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:29.000
 our own wisdom to come, to be a part of our practice, to really flourish and activate.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:34.000
 So that essentially is the whole chapter there.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000
 And then, if we read that second topic.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 So this is from page 57, the first paragraph, and then also page 58, the last paragraph.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.000
 There is a particular Dzogchen technique for breath purification

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000
 that releases the inner air of the negative emotions.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.000
 The three main emotions, often called the three poisons,

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000
 are attachment, anger, and ignorance.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:04.000
 By releasing the air connected with the three poisons, you can clarify your wind energy.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000
 Doing this exercise will help to clear the air of the emotions.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:13.000
 When the emotion air is dispelled, at that moment, wisdom air will appear more clearly.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000
 After doing this exercise to purify the breath,

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.450
 your mind will be clearer and calmer, and it will be easier to maintain your mind in the meditative

00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:22.000
 state.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.000
 Sounds good. It sounds like we should be doing this breath purification all the time.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:41.000
 I know one thing that I think, that I often forget with this breath purification is that

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:48.000
 because so much of the actual movement is to release the negative air,

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:53.000
 that sometimes I really forget to bring in the wisdom air too.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000
 So it's not just expelling the stale air,

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.650
 it's also inviting and literally taking in the wisdom air to fill up our channels with this wisdom

00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:02.000
 wind.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:07.000
 So Rummuche, Kemurumuche, and Kenshi Paul and Rummuche definitely said very clearly

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:14.000
 that about this far around you is to see that this five-colored wisdom wind is in the space around

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:14.000
 you

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.000
 and you literally breathe it in on the inhalation.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:25.000
 And then as you expel, just as they described in this chapter, you expel those karmic winds.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:30.000
 But just to not forget that we're not just cleaning the system,

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:38.030
 we're totally rejuvenating, reactivating so that everything is fully presently online and firing

00:28:38.030 --> 00:28:39.000
 and all that.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:47.000
 And then we can begin the practice with this vibrant, fresh, joyous, uplifted approach.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:54.610
 And literally saying on this subtle level that it is, it is totally rejuvenated like our body, like

00:28:54.610 --> 00:28:57.000
 our this subtle body too.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000
 And what does that mean?

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:05.000
 When we expel all the karmic duality winds, what's left?

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000
 Wisdom winds, just like what they say.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.000
 And they say, they didn't emphasize so much in here, but you should imagine,

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:18.000
 from your whole previous lifetimes, all the anger that you've ever experienced

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:23.000
 in all your past lifetimes up until this moment is totally purified in God.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:28.950
 And it's replaced by wisdom, wisdom wind, and the same thing with attachment and the same thing

00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:30.000
 with ignorance.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000
 But what does that mean?

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:38.000
 Our bodies are totally cured, that we're in the wisdom state, that our body is in the wisdom state,

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.000
 that our mind is in the wisdom state, that our speech is in the wisdom state.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:47.000
 So it's like totally connecting with that like nature right off the bat.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:56.000
 Not like, "I am more and more ordinary me, with all my deluded junk sitting down to do a practice

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000
 that's totally separate from that."

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000
 It's totally not the view that is actually this technique.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:10.000
 This technique is like you're totally reconnecting with your own whole being of body, speech, and

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:10.000
 mind

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:17.000
 as a total unity, which even in the Four Empowerments, Guru Yoga, body, speech, mind, unity.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.000
 It's like we're totally connecting with that.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.000
 And then we're meditating in that whole context so that our whole practice is in that context.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:30.000
 And that way, we'll really develop confidence.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:35.000
 Because that's what we're doing in practice.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:40.000
 That's what the Dzogchen teachings say, and that's what all the teachings say.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:45.000
 To see that, and experience that, and know that, not just like,

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:52.000
 "Okay, here we go again. My normal deluded depressed self is going to engage."

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:57.000
 No, sit up straight about the posture and adopt a view.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000
 And within that, expel the negative air, the wisdom duality air,

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000
 and then do the whole practice in that state.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:13.000
 I mean, I'm talking like I know, but it's such a good thing to remember that that is the view.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 That's what we are doing.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:24.000
 And so I have a question.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000
 So these are particular instructions for this formal meditation time.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:34.000
 How we should sit with our body, and how our wind should circulate ideally.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:39.000
 So then, when we get up after a session, and we're not formally meditating,

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:43.000
 but we're in this post-meditation, well then how does all this work then?

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:49.590
 Because we have these very particular, you have your body in this position because it's ideal for

00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:50.000
 it,

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000
 I think, to circulate well.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.460
 And then have your breathing in this particular way, because it's ideal to have your mind be

00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:57.000
 balanced.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:02.000
 So then when we get up, and walk, and stand, and lie down, and all these other postures,

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:07.000
 and we're using our speed, so our wind is not just naturally, it's like kind of using it, you know?

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:11.000
 So then how does that fit with this?

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:18.000
 So the question is meditation. These are very particular meditation instructions.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:25.000
 So by hearing these instructions, what does it say about how do we practice in post-meditation too?

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:31.000
 When we're not in this posture, we're not doing this purification practice right in the,

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:36.000
 as we're just talking, or you know, doing our usual daily life things.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000
 And so how do they fit together?

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:45.000
 Where you mentioned the four foundations of mindfulness earlier.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:50.990
 That's a, in the Buddha he gave so many teachings on mindfulness as the foundation of all Dhamma

00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:52.000
 practice.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000
 When you're eating, you're aware that you're eating.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000
 When you take a bite of the apple, you're aware that you're taking a bite of the apple.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000
 When you're speaking, you're aware that you're speaking and what you're saying.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:10.030
 When you're walking, generally they say, whether you're walking, sitting, speaking, or sleeping,

00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:11.000
 right?

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000
 Standing, walking, lying.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000
 Standing, walking, lying.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.000
 Sitting.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000
 And sitting. You're totally aware that you're doing that.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:29.000
 So that's definitely tied in, at least from the foundation of recognizing what you're doing.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:35.000
 Because when we're up and about, we still have these channels and these winds and this mind.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:41.000
 So, whereas it's easier maybe to, when we're, you know, have this formal time set aside,

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:46.000
 to just to really cultivate our awareness, our mind, you know.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:52.000
 Because like in a formal meditation session, we set the posture, we set the breathing,

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000
 and then just release it, let it be natural.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:59.000
 And then the principle thing we're relating to is the mind, in a way.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:05.000
 But then in a post meditation, oftentimes we're so focused on what is the body doing,

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.000
 you have to eat, and what am I saying, and these outward things.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:14.000
 So it's not so much focusing on the mind as it is the activities of the mind,

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000
 the expressions of the body in the speech.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:23.000
 And here, I think it's really beautiful, in one of these definitions here of post meditation.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000
 I wonder if I should say that.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.000
 During formal meditation, we learn how to rest in profound emptiness,

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000
 the non-grasping state of non-duality.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:38.000
 And during post meditation, we learn how to continuously work with the richness qualities of mind,

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000
 including love, compassion, and wisdom.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:46.000
 This helps us maintain a balance between the absolute and relative aspects of awareness,

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000
 enabling us to increasingly discover them both.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000
 So this is really valuable.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:57.000
 Like while this chapter is really highlighting the formal component,

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.000
 it's not to say this less formal or post meditation isn't important, it's essential.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:09.640
 In a way, it's this more outward, outreaching, relative aspect of the whole practice and of our

00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:11.000
 mind, you know, of what we are.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:19.000
 And bottom line, if we don't do that, if we can't learn to do that when we're not meditating,

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:26.730
 and you practice one hour a day, which is great, that means 23 hours a day you're not practicing at

00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:27.000
 all.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:35.650
 You know, unless you bring this like you were saying, unless we can learn how to focus on these

00:35:35.650 --> 00:35:37.000
 things that you just said,

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:42.000
 you know, the post meditative state of love, compassion, and mindfulness.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:47.000
 And that's kind of a, I mean, that's kind of a, it's a true statement,

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:54.000
 but it's a little daunting, you know, if you think like, if we only think that we're practicing

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.000
 when we're on the cushion,

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:01.000
 we'll never attain enlightenment. You just can't do it, because it's like, one hour of wisdom,

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:07.000
 let's say your meditation is 100% perfect, complete wisdom meditation, no duality,

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:15.000
 and then the other 23 hours is 100% duality. But anyway, that's not an emphasis on the negative,

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:20.070
 it's just to say that like, we are whole beings, you know, we have these components all the time,

00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:22.000
 so...

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:29.280
 I mean, and also just, I mean, this is, that question just makes me think about how through

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:32.000
 meditation practice we become,

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000
 we're trying to become more familiar with our mind, that's the whole point.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:43.000
 And so then we can see formal meditation practice, definitely so important, I mean, always,

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:49.000
 but in the beginning, it really helps us to really even recognize mind, what is mind at all?

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:54.160
 What are we talking about when we say mind? And then like, so the more we get this kind of idea of

00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:55.000
 what that is,

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:01.000
 and then post meditation, like automatically, we can start to see like, oh, this is,

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:07.660
 what is this mind that's carrying through everything, like whether I'm sitting here or doing all

00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:09.000
 these other activities,

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:15.130
 you know, that that's what we're, we're hopefully like learning to not eventually make a

00:37:15.130 --> 00:37:17.000
 distinction between them, you know,

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:23.000
 that because the mind, the mind is there always, you know.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:29.000
 So anyway, just trying to think about how to link like formal meditation and then post meditation,

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:37.000
 and yeah, they're doing different things, but like eventually, it's the same, you know.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:42.000
 Yeah, really training to develop that realization, which is such a high level of realization,

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:48.000
 the word meditation and post meditation are the same. It's very, really hot, but yeah.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:53.000
 And I mean, part of that is coming just from thinking about like in this term definition,

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:59.000
 just saying that particularly in formal meditation, we're trying to connect with our absolute,

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000
 absolute level or absolute nature.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:08.000
 And then in post meditation, it's more the relative level of engaging and like trying to develop

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.000
 these qualities,

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:14.000
 the arising qualities of our mind or expressive qualities of our mind.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:19.000
 But ultimately, again, like that we see that, and they say that all throughout this book,

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:26.000
 you know, and so many books and teachings talk about that, like trying to really use to see one and

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:26.000
 the other,

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:30.000
 to see the relative and the absolute and absolute and the relative.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:36.370
 And so in that way, that's like the bridge, really. It's like bringing formal meditation into post

00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:37.000
 meditation.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:41.000
 And it does, I think, just happen naturally as you do it more.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:48.000
 But because we're more on the side as we begin and we're more familiar with not meditating

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:53.000
 or like not being familiar with our mind, it's really so important in the beginning,

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:59.260
 especially for, you know, till we get really stable to be emphasizing, I think, a little more the

00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:00.000
 formal side.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000
 I mean, that's just what I think.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:07.990
 And if you look at these really exceptional masters like the Kemperimiches and, I mean, so many

00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:09.000
 other great masters,

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:15.000
 that they're just so highly realized and stable in their realization.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:21.000
 And yet they spend so much time in formal meditation and in contemplation,

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:26.000
 like studying, investigating, analyzing, at least that's, I think, what we've seen,

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:31.000
 have the really fortunate opportunity to see that even if these great masters

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:37.000
 that have totally blended in their meditation and post meditation experiences,

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:42.000
 they still spend so much time, like the first Kensei Rinpoche or the first Kontrol,

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:48.000
 I mean, they spend so much time doing these expressive, outreaching, compassionate activities,

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.000
 but also on the cushion.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:56.000
 Really, Milarepa's final teaching to Gampoko was to show how calloused his bottom and his legs are.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:03.000
 It's like, if you, in Lama Chiman too, he says it's better to wear out one cushion

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.000
 than hundreds of pairs of shoes.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.000
 I like that.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.000
 It's really like formal practice is so important.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:16.000
 These are great masters. These are really his wisdom words, you know?

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:20.000
 So, it's good and these may be, like you said, simple techniques.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.000
 They may sound simple, but it's because they're profound.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:27.000
 These have been passed down for centuries, thousands of years.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:32.000
 That's why, if they didn't work, people wouldn't gain realization by using them,

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:39.000
 but obviously that's not the case, because all the great masters use them.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:45.000
 So, how should we see the relative when we're in post meditation?

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.000
 This is our final summary point.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:53.000
 How should we see the relative in a post meditation state?

00:40:53.000 --> 00:41:00.000
 Really, it's an opportunity for bodhisattva activity, in a way, as an illusion.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000
 It's a dreamlike expression.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.000
 Nothing we're trying to avoid, nothing we're trying to really...

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.000
 We're trying not to hold on to it as a substantially existent real thing

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.000
 that we have to defend against or grab onto.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:20.000
 So, it's constantly in flux, constantly flowing, totally dynamic, just like this is our mind.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.000
 This is a reflection of mind.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:26.000
 This is just like a dream experience that's happening in my mind, to try to see it fluidly,

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:31.000
 so that the meditation that we have on the cushion really is incorporated into post meditation.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.000
 This is just a... I mean, really it is like, that's what they're trying to say.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:39.490
 Meditation isn't just some small technique we apply, just when everything's just right and it's

00:41:39.490 --> 00:41:40.000
 nice.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:46.000
 But meditation is the approach to try to constantly be actively available to any experience

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:51.000
 or anything that might happen, and to try to stay open and fresh and engage it

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:57.000
 and not close up and shut down and get defensive and all about me.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.000
 I mean, that's the point.

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.000
 And that's like a seamless blend.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.000
 These great masters of meditation and post meditation.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:13.000
 You see everything like a dream, just compassionate.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:16.000
 I mean, I've seen... Yeah, I mean, this is going to be completely...

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.000
 But Vacheria... I mean, Vacheria is seeing more, not so much as a dream to say,

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:25.650
 but this... I mean, this says a lot, but that it's more, it's already pure, it's already totally

00:42:25.650 --> 00:42:26.000
 complete.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:33.000
 It's not just an illusory dynamic experience, but it's like a 100% pure, perfect display.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:39.000
 A perfect display of the natural inheritance or natural awareness is the source,

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:43.000
 the ever-abiding source of all things that are ever happening, you know?

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:48.000
 So this is all a dynamic display of enlightened beings and doing enlightened activities.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.000
 And where there too is the center, and on their side, they're the center.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:59.000
 And it's all this already perfectly complete celebration of the true nature that we all share.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:05.000
 So it's not just a dream that could be good, could be bad, it's a total, yeah,

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:11.000
 total beautiful celebration of the nature that is always perfect.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:16.540
 So in that sense, it's all wisdom, wind, and I mean, there's just so many teachings on all these

00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:18.000
 things, but...

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:24.000
 That's it, practice.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:30.000
 Thanks. We'll just do a very brief silent meditation and then dedicate the merit.
