00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.210
 This practice is very special throughout the times. I think K.T. Pardeshirab removed her mind so

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.000
 many times how important this practice is.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 In particular, also performing the ceremony of the Fire Puja is one of the very special practices.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.550
 It's very, very good for opportunities. It's not just that I'm threatening you all, but it is truly

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:28.000
 precious.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:36.460
 It's very special to recognize this. Again, we had many different opportunities, circumstances and

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.000
 conditions.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 To gather together and perform this ceremony is special and very, very beautiful.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:54.490
 So therefore, these beautiful practices, we're trying to carry out that with motivation. And again,

00:00:54.490 --> 00:01:00.000
 bodhicitta, thinking of everyone, we do these practices.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 And those who are here and those who are gone, and there are many levels.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.400
 And then also, again, in the world, there are so many difficulties and troubles happening one after

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.000
 another.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.320
 I don't know if it's, again, in my mind or just a few of ours' minds, sometimes the fields look

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:24.500
 more like these natural disasters approaching more and more than before that we remember or thought

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.000
.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 Even though in one way the world is more calm and peaceful, there are not too many wars.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 First World War, World War II, World War II, those all happen.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.390
 And throughout history, there are a lot of wars happening. But maybe this time, not too comfortable

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:48.390
 to compare with that, maybe not less in that level due to the many different, I think, forces and

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.000
 many different beings.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 The great beings that create peace and harmonics in one way.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.150
 But however, these natural disasters and the disease and the sicknesses and many different levels

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:06.000
 is really kind of more dense and more powerful than even before.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 And whether it is true or not, but the practice and meditation is so important for all of us.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 We know that. It's something that brings a value in our quality, our value, our inner qualities.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 And this is something that we ultimately can rely on for us, ourselves or others.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 External, maternal things, there are so many things, comes, goes on and off, and so many things.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.070
 But really, the own level that we can rely on, ultimately, is something that, what we call the

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.000
 inner well for the Dharma.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.930
 The practice is so important. And that is truly re-witnessed by the many circumstances and the

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.000
 situations.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.200
 I'm sure you also must be experienced with that. And therefore, Dharma is something so important

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.000
 and special.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.770
 And by generally practicing Dharma and practicing good things is so good, so special. It rewards us

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:06.000
.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 It always brings courage and confidence and a sense of dignity in our heart and mind.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.120
 When we do good things, when we do nice things that we can believe or we know that, it's something

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.000
 special.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.180
 And then practice is so special. It is the practice that is practiced by so many great masters and

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.000
 practitioners throughout the centuries,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 throughout the years, the sense of "Buddha, give this teaching."

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 It says, "Gurubyama, some will give this teaching. Show this."

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 And see, this sense, this great master, for example, mainly teaching, give this teaching.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.380
 Ever since this practice, there's so many times, one after another, in a human world, and I'm sure

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.000
 in a different world, there's been practices.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:55.340
 And we follow that, these footsteps, exactly that steps, with our best capabilities and external

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.000
 level.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.960
 But what we need to do, we need to match up with our inner quality, the joy and devotion in both

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.000
 each other.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.260
 When you combine that trigger, our practice with our motivation, then it begins to lift up and

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:15.000
 bring the new dimension of creating new dimension things, many different really levels.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.760
 So therefore, again, I'm just reminded to all of us, and toghed in a way, this is one of the

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.000
 beautiful opportunities,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 the beautiful times that we had this practice again and again, again and again, so many years.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 Never happened in history of the New York City, maybe.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 This many practices are really true, or maybe not even in this America history.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 I'm not just saying that.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.380
 But we're doing this. It's not just a bragging, but it's truly, we've been doing, and we're able to

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.000
 do this.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 And thanks to John, his--
