00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.580
 The meditation status. When we are meditating, then how are we going to maintain that meditation?

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:17.060
 When we are meditating, what? And the teaching said "Ebaidi". I use the word "Ebaidi" in Tibetan.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.240
 It's called "Nepa".

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.620
 And I also said yesterday, when we are meditating, there are three things happening.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:31.700
 Three things happening, those are known as "Nepa" and "Yewa" and "Rupa" in Tibetan.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:43.250
 And the English translation will be "Ebaidi" and the movement and recognizing or beholding that

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.360
 movement and that "Ebaidi".

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:52.080
 So those are the three kinds of naturally occurring qualities.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:58.780
 The first, the most important, is "Ebaidi" for us. Particularly for many of us, as a beginner

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:59.680
 practitioner,

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:07.000
 "Ebaidi" is very important and that's why. Why is "Ebaidi" very important? Because our prison mind

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.020
 is a conception.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:15.890
 Conservation is very turbulent, it's restless, it's carrying all kind of heart, never really

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.160
 resting on the nature of the mind.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:24.540
 We are wandering all the time. Therefore, "Ebaidi" is very, very important.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.960
 To do "Ebaidi", I also mentioned it many times and the great master of thinking, but he mentioned

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:30.760
 it many times.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:37.080
 And I'm sure you heard that from other great masters, it is important to have "Chamada" meditation,

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.840
 mostly.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.240
 "Chamada", literally, "Chamada" means calm, abiding calm.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:50.520
 What that actually really means, stopping the thought. Stopping the thought. That is.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:57.400
 So, in one way means stopping the thought. Stopping the thought, how are you stopping the thought?

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:03.680
 You are also stopping the thought, very gentle, very relaxing, very comfortably.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:13.830
 You are preventing to not coming the thought. And that is known as one way understanding of "Cham

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:14.800
ada".

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:23.390
 So, to ask for the cause, forming the mind becomes very active, then I also suggested that even we

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.680
 are meditating on the droning at the beginning time or the beginning session.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.960
 Maybe for 5-10 minutes, we do "Chamada" very well. Trying to make some stopping thought.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:43.670
 That means effort. If you do some duty, you are making effort, and some making stop thought,

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.760
 preventing thought.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:52.020
 And those are then, with the object, with the object, all objects, such as the divine sage of the

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.040
 Buddha, "Chakamuni", all that, all without object.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:04.310
 Without object, just really stopping the thought for 5 minutes or 3-4 minutes. And what that will

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.440
 help? What will that do?

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:13.890
 It will subside in the running thought, running, consulting thought, turbulent thought. It will

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.640
 slow down. It will help it slow down.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:26.400
 Then, now you are going to be relaxing on the meditating and the "Zoki". "Zoki" in the meditation

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.640
 is not stopping the thought.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:37.780
 That's what I said many times. You now must be hearing that again and again. But in Chitji, he said

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.640
, "Let it come. What let it come? Let thought come.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:52.260
 Let it be. Let that go away." That is the "Zoki". Nature of the mind is the flowing natural systems

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.640
.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:04:00.740
 We like to say, in the flowing natural systems, nature cannot prevent it. How we can prevent the

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:06.640
 block in the wind, wind, or sunshine, weather, any of these.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:14.710
 I mean, if we do, that is just making up ourselves more tired. Similarly, the nature of the mind is

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:15.640
 active.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:25.890
 Mind is active. Mind is flowing. Mind is very energetic. So if we prevent it trying to stop, that

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.640
 is not the nature.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:37.210
 Nature. Therefore, "Zoki" means we are discovering exactly where the "nature" it is. "Nature" it is

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.640
.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:45.640
 And then, that's why I said, "Abide it. Let it come. Let it go. Let it be. This."

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:55.680
 We don't regulate that. What that flow is, is all known as Dharmakaya displays. When we start

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.640
 regulating these and that, these and that things,

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:04.670
 I said yesterday quite a few times, and also of course many times, that recollection of thinking

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.640
 these and that is dualities.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:13.640
 Whether it is big, whether it is small, whether it is a certain, it is dualities.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:24.640
 What it is about? Or grasping, it is grasping. What that grasping is? Then it is samsara.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:32.640
 It is the beginning of samsara. The clinging is clinging or grasping is samsara.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:45.000
 So, labeling these and chasing upward thought. Whether it is gross thought, small thought, or

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.640
 monkey-mind thought, or mouse-mind thought,

00:05:48.640 --> 00:06:00.230
 mouse-mind thought, it is clinging. It is grasping. Gasping. That means what? When we do cling and

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:02.640
 grasping, we are not letting it go.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:09.450
 That we've been doing from the biggest times. We are not letting it go. When it is not letting it

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:09.640
 go,

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:16.550
 what it is okay to teach is you are not liberating. You are not liberating. Where you are

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:17.640
 liberating?

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:25.270
 Dharmakaya. Where this thought comes from? It is Dharmakaya. What is that thought? It is the

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.640
 expression of Dharmakayas.

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:34.170
 Where it is going? It is Dharmakaya. It is all display of Dharmakayas. Dharmakaya. Those are what

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:34.640
 is known.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:41.640
 Dharmakaya is display of sambhokaya, namakayas. This is what nature is.

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:50.640
 Where we started regulating that, then we are putting another dharma or another clinging, grasping

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:51.640
 and deluding that.

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:59.840
 So therefore, as I said, the first is important is to stabilize the mind with the support of such

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:00.640
 as samatams.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:08.640
 Once that, let it be there, and then we relax on the natural state or zoopdi state, like a body, a

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:08.640
 body.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:17.890
 That is then relaxing. As I said yesterday, then carefreeze, or not trying to make something, not

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:19.640
 holding, relax.

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:32.470
 When you relax, relax on all the six senses. Six senses, eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and mind, all

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:33.640
 relaxed.

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:38.640
 Let that be in their own natural state, whatever it is, and you relax.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:47.640
 Relaxing and beholding the beauty of Dharmakayas, the awareness of Rupa.

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:51.640
 Rupa is Dharmakayas. That is what we behold.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.640
 So, with this understanding,
