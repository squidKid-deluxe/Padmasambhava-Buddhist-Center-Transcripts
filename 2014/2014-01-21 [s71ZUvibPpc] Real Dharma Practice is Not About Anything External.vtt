00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.320
 When we do practices, of course, as always we need, and this practice is generally what the Buddha

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:16.720
 said.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:29.760
 Practicing is not by the external. In the Buddha teaching, he said, it's not by the hand instrument

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:29.840
,

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:37.680
 the new home. The way you dress up, this is not really practices. The way you keep your hair,

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:45.440
 this is not practices. The practice is by mind. This is the mind. So it's not external things,

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:53.160
 practice means. Buddha teaching is practice is not external gestures that you see. See,

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:02.840
 the pre-practice, true practice is by mind. Therefore, when you practice as we could,

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:11.320
 this is from our great masters. I'm just reminding that. It's our mind. So therefore,

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:20.400
 we always must be trying to be distantly and correcting our mind, particularly time of the

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:27.240
 practices. That means we do practices, for example, and we have time. Practice for one

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:35.680
 hours or 40 minutes, or maybe one and a half hours. At that time, we try to really keep that

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:43.800
 mind something special. And it's very old, what is called this mind? It's called kung-ho, kung-ho.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:51.960
 Kung-ho is old, long means that we'll bring out that. So that means, kung-ho means the mind that

00:01:51.960 --> 00:02:01.160
 will bring anything, anything that means. So we have to keep the good mind that will bring all

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:07.640
 the good things. That's what we need. And therefore, when we start thinking of the mind,

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:14.520
 this kung-ho in the available kung-ho that will bring everything, there is always these great

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:22.840
 masters in the Buddha teaching set three, three state of kung-ho's, the positives, negatives,

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:32.080
 and the neutrons. Among these three, when we practice time, what kind of kung-ho we need,

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:39.640
 what kind of mind? If I love that oscillator, what kind of attitude do we want? Attitude,

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:49.380
 the positive mind. Positive attitudes, not the negatives, not even neutral. What is the negatives,

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:56.200
 negative attitude? Again, negative attitude is then related connected with negativities,

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:06.240
 ignorance, attachment, anger, jealous. And as I said before, making the scepticals. And the mind

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:13.520
 is kind of like too much scared and so forth, and hovering so many things. Not really subtle,

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:22.360
 that those are all known as kind of negatives. And then along that, too many scared thoughts,

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:28.680
 this also can be neutral. Very maybe not nothing too negative, but neutral and just too scared,

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:35.360
 we're not subtle. That also not going to help the practice, is not going to make good call

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.320
 practices.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:45.240
 And we like to make that one hour sitting nice and good practices, good one. Then this kung-ho,

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:53.480
 correct kung-ho, correct motivation is really so important, so necessary. That is then in this case

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:53.480
,

00:03:53.480 --> 00:04:03.720
 simple world Buddha teaching, both each other, the devotion, the joy, that we should pray. It's

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:11.560
 nothing extra ordinary that we have to get and make some big effort. It's all our mind. To make

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.200
 this, we like to make the difference to our practices, and we like to make the differences,

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:23.520
 difference to our future destinations, future progress, future developments. We start right now,

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:32.400
 right now, reading this beautiful motivation. And that motivation as I said, it's only so simple.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.160
 Joy,

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:42.600
 the appreciations, and the devotions. When you have the joy and appreciation and the body temper,

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:52.760
 immediately subsided. All those negativity is thoughts, thoughts. Even attachment, anger, doubt,

00:04:52.760 --> 00:05:05.040
 hesitation, and arrogance. All just simultaneously dispel. As the morning sunshine comes, or the

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.200
 heat

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:12.320
 light on the sky, that moment that darkness is fading away. Similarly, the brilliant sun comes,

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:21.240
 it's all. It's our nature, your nature, my nature. It's your nature, our my nature. It's true

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.480
 nature,

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:30.480
 it's good. It will assure our lives. It will assure our lives, it will assure our practices. It is

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.920
 so

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:37.880
 good. If we combine that practice with Jyoti meditation, Jyoti practice, Vayayana teachings,

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:46.880
 then it will boost up the Vayayana practice. Jyoti meditation becomes so special, so beautiful,

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:55.200
 so targeted, so directed. Jyoti become truly Jyoti. Mahabhadar become practiced truly Mahabhadarist

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.320
.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:03.240
 And another become truly another practice. With all these qualities, almost they become names.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:13.240
 It don't sink to the heart. It don't make the changes from the deep levels. This is so simple,

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:23.760
 so carefree, so basic, yet in the center column of our practices. So therefore, this this karmu,

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:30.440
 this attitude, or this mind is so important. For that reason, many great master and Buddha

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:36.640
 teachings and his whole Duryamurjic, Kenkipati here, and all the great teachers that I heard,

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:43.690
 we read the books, and you read books, all that's what is said. A mind is positive, everything

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:44.240
 become

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:52.720
 positive. A mind is negative, everything become negative. A mind is neutral, everything neutral.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:07:01.360
 This is the mind, the unseen, this emptiness mind. It is so powerful, indicating our direction,

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:08.960
 indicating our environment. These are not just the way stories that are made or that are revealed

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:17.520
 as echoes of the great monsters. It's truly, when you look carefully, it is our mind. It will

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:17.920
 change

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:25.000
 our destination, our environment, our things. Buddha made enlightenment, practice it, it comes

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:32.400
 from there. And for that reason, Buddha said extended gesture is not teaching. Really teaching,

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:42.840
 really practice, is starting with the mind. Mind. And therefore, it is so, so, so special. So for

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:48.600
 that reason, there are always, we should really be strengthening our beautiful motivation. Whenever

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:53.720
 we practice, whenever we do the meditation, we shouldn't, in the immediate importance,

00:07:53.720 --> 00:08:01.880
 let's start with joy and appreciation and bodhicitta, kindness, compassion. Joy and

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:09.400
 appreciation. Appreciation is basic Buddha's teachings, basic Buddha's teaching, and Hinyana

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:17.240
 teaching, and we use words, all basic Buddha's teachings. Joy and appreciation, respect. Or in

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:25.480
 a simple word, in a way, what they call graceful. Think graceful. That is what it is. This is done,

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:31.320
 this is spiritual. This is not something that we're doing extra digital from outside of Dharma

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:32.360
 cycle.

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:42.120
 This is truly practices. With that, we add the Mahayana teachings. That is what, then bodhicitta.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:51.400
 Bodhicitta is love, bodhicitta is confession, bodhicitta is taking all the means, every living

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:57.320
 means. Whether we know them, whether we don't know them, or whether they are our family members,

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:05.320
 friends, and neighbors, and we eat the best from our heart. And put pray for that. Even we couldn't

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:13.560
 do anything immediately, diddly, physically. But at least we can do the prayer. We can open our

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:13.800
 heart

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:21.880
 and ignite the light of love and compassion. What's next? Every generation, wish them. That is the

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:27.080
 bodhicitta, starting bodhicitta. That's what the Buddha's teaching said, as we all know that.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:34.840
 It's called wishing bodhicitta. We're wishing something sincerely from our heart to all the

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:43.160
 beings. That moment, ourself, making something difference. Ourself, we were making something

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:49.960
 difference in our lives. And that in our times, really truly. And it will make also difference

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:58.520
 something according to the, as we wish. It will do that. So therefore, wishing both each other

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:03.480
 is that. And the Buddha's teaching said we heard so many times. We know the bodhicitta,

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:09.400
 there is no Buddha, no enlightenment. That means we know the bodhicitta, we're not going to reveal

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:16.680
 our full, blossom nature of the mind. We're not going to reveal. Reveal and not, not natural,

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:22.120
 but not call it. Nature will call it. Also we're not, nature will call it our mind. We're not

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:28.860
 going to reveal it. We know the bodhicitta. We know the bodhicitta is the key. We know the bodhic

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:29.320
itta

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:36.360
 is a light that will follow with that light. It's become bigger and bigger and bigger,

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:43.400
 then truly we become enlightened. Not dark nights, dark nights. Becoming enlightened.

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:50.680
 That's how we start bodhicitta. And with bodhicitta, then what we get according to our teaching,

00:10:50.680 --> 00:11:00.200
 with pure perceptions, pure inner state. Pure inner state is same as being graceful, enjoy,

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:10.440
 appreciates, and being happy. Trying to be happy. Happy, trying to be happy, what we have.

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:17.800
 Started happiness what we have. Not just of happiness because we're going to come waiting

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:24.600
 for something. Happiness we started right now. That happiness and joy and appreciation is the

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:30.520
 key and the foundation to open the pure inner state. Glory is nature that Buddha gave to the

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:37.000
 Vajrayana teachings. Entirely that richness, natures, richness godly, the pure light,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.200
 the akalishta, all those beautiful things the Buddha said. It's not just something

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:49.800
 somewhere. It's right here. We don't see that. Because the ego clinging, because of the

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:58.360
 limit of our narrow mind and the narrow, narrow kind of that darkness of the ignorance,

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:07.240
 we block that godness. To open that vision of the door, that mystery, the door is joy and

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:15.960
 appreciation and pure inner state being graceful. That graceful, that light of that with love and

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:24.040
 compassion and then devotion. When effort will develop that beautiful nature, that beautiful

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:30.840
 gorgeous of the whole everything. So this is what if we, when we practice, when we practice

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:37.160
 the meditation, when we do this one hour or 40 minutes or how now and really we have that natural,

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:44.840
 natural, then our practice becomes so beautiful, so special. Every contact percentage, for example,

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:51.800
 percentage, then and we have that our practice becomes 100 percent beautiful, 100 percent

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:58.760
 beautiful. If we don't have that enough, then accordingly that percentage our practice is

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:07.400
 80 percent, 70 percent, 60 percent. If we are not very little, then our, even we're sitting

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:14.360
 in one hour practices, our practice, they call it level. Our practice is just 25 percent.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:23.240
 So that all depends from us, from ourself. So therefore this kulma or this mind, something

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:29.720
 that is really correctly immediately, just we bring up that joy and appreciation and devotion

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:35.400
 and bodhicana and then we graceful and feel the presence of the whole enlightened beings,

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:43.640
 bodhisattva. Even we don't see right moment in our eyesight, but feel that this is what we call,

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:52.280
 as Buddha teaching said, we are all moving from the direction to revealing the inconceivable

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:53.080
 natural,

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:58.680
 the inconceivable qualities. Why don't we do that? Therefore, so this is how we begin.

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:03.960
 And then gathering like this, for example, it's very wonderful, it's so special. I know

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:10.360
 you have made effort by all the things, different things. It's not just a comeback itself. You have

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:16.280
 met so much effort, so many ways. One after another and met this and gathered and targeted

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:21.960
 and we're practicing and discussing the Buddha teaching something so marvelous, so special.

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:27.480
 We follow with the footsteps of the aching, those great, great practitioners and truly,

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:33.800
 we are following that footsteps. We hold it there like as token with love and joy. This is

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:39.480
 matters for a special marriage or activities, something special. So we can really dedicated this

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:46.600
 very in honor of all the great master's teachers and also the distributed this merit, they added

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:51.720
 all the sentence means bring the new peace, happiness, as we just discussed in this.

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:56.200
 So that is the what my will you talk to me and so thank you.
