00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.290
 In general, in the Kedam, of course you all know, Kedam means learning the philosophy systems of

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.000
 that what we practice.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.660
 In general, in the Buddha teaching, and particularly in the Yuma system, always the studying and

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.000
 the practice goes by Chobiddi, not separately.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 What are you studying? That you practice. What you practice, you study, you learn.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.950
 So the studying is not just an intellectual, kind of skeptical idea that left-hand side, and just

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.000
 only used kind of proof.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 Proof, kind of like some kind of professional, or kind of like surviving purpose of these lives.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:55.070
 What we're studying is we practice, we observe that, and we carry that, and then observe that in

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.000
 our mental state, of the nature of the mind.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 And that is what we started, and that's what we practice.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.380
 So practice is also not just practicing blindly, and then just what we're saying, and just follow

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.000
 that.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 We learn what we're practicing, and search behind meaning what we're practicing.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.210
 And that is what we leave in the Buddha's teaching, and particularly in the Yuma system, the

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.000
 studying and the practice goes by Chobiddi.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 So therefore, here is what we're studying. What we're studying, we're studying to use to practice.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 And practice is what, of course, we all know what means practice.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 Practice means bring the inner result, any result.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 Result, what is result? Result is joy, happiness, and happiness and joy to the others.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:07.210
 It's not joy and happiness is restricted, and joy and happiness that we expanded and share that to

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:08.000
 everyone.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 So everyone will catch that in might call it.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 In a way, we become as clear luminosity light, lame.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.510
 The lame will illuminate ourselves like that will illuminate it, and that will help to illuminate

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:23.000
 others,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 because others have the same potential, same nature will illuminate.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 That is the purpose in the teaching of the Buddha.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 Buddha, so that we all have the equal realization, because basically, every living means the same,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 equal.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 There is no really difference at all. Everyone has the same nature.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 Therefore, everyone is looking for the joy and happiness.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 Everyone wants to remove the suffering and sadness. They don't like that.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.030
 Because we share the same feeling, because we have the same nature, same thing, same nature,

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.000
 everyone.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.720
 Therefore, this practice means practice makes ourselves a joy, happiness, and they share that to

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.000
 others,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 and bring that their realization to all.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 And that, again, happiness and joy is not just temporary things.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 And as we know, that in the teaching said, we all inherit Buddha-natural.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:32.120
 Buddha-natural, tatagatagarva, or any call it of the natural. Natural, and that is, that nature is

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.000
 free from the old duality,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 free from the negativities such as obscurations, ego-cleans, self-importance, and greed.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 It's completely freed, because those are not natural.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 Natural is freed. When you are freed of all those negativities, the Buddha-natural self is joy.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:04:00.630
 Whatever we name is joy, is happy, is peaceful, is totally openness, totally believed wisdom, great

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.000
 compassion,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 loving kindness, that is the nature that we all inherit.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 And for that purpose, every Buddha-teaching is designed for that, to go, to river that natures.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 When we started in the Buddha's teaching, teaching as like first schools of the world, or not so,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:29.660
 so the first schools of the Buddhism, such as Vaisikha, Suttantaka, and mind-only school, and Madem

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:30.000
aka,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 every teaching, whatever the Buddha uses techniques, accord and readiness of the individual is,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:45.870
 but goal is to free of those negativities and dualities, and reveal the inner quality, accord and

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.000
 their readiness.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:57.330
 And such as like then in the, such as Vaisikha school, or pass like Hinayana, always we say, Saty

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:58.000
asharvakaya,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:06.140
 and they free from the ego-cleans. Once you remove the ego-cleaning, you reach that arahata-fook, a

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.000
rahata.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 And that is what their goal, and that, when you free from the ego, what is brains?

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 When it brings peace, the nirvana, free from suffering.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 Nirvana means free from suffering, isn't it difficult? It's ended all sufferings.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 The ego-cleaning, ego, ego, or this is self-important, that is the double matter.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 And when you free that, then the nirvana, peace, tortures, tangle it, it comes.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 That is what the practice is. And there is also practice, way to practice.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 And of course in the teaching always mentioned, mentioned how to pursue those practices.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:00.810
 There is a conduct, there is a will, there is application, and then follow that, and you receive it

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:01.000
.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 You reach the goal of the arahata-fook, arahata.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 And then beside that, the kyavaka, and the satya, as pati-buddhas.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 Again, pati-buddha practices. Pati-buddha practices.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 They practice, again, similar things, but we focus with twelve inter-pedo-korgianic systems.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:30.450
 Reversing that inter-pedo-korgianic system, because twelve lengths of inter-pedo-korgianic is the

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:32.000
 source of all the troubles.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 When you reverse that, and then it stops, one after another, another, that is how it begins.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 It comes, continuation, when you reverse that, it stops, stops.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 And through that technique, they get the realization of the egolessness,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 and as well as the realization of the great emptiness of the external phenomena existing.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 Sometimes the teaching says one and a half realization of the great natures, not completely.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:11.420
 In a way, like three-quarters of the realization, they achieve, of the true natural, of the as-true

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:13.000
 natural, or the great emptiness.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.470
 Then we move to the mind-only school. We move to the mind-only school, and as well as mind-only

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:21.000
 school is the Mahayana schools.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:28.520
 Again, it's best, absolutely, on the great computer, allowing kindness, kindness, and bringing

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.000
 everything as a mental display of the mind.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:38.000
 Everything, what we perceive, home, song, space, or another way, all the tangible things,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 everything is really a display of our own mind, originally started.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 Once we got that realization here clearly, this is illusion display.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:53.630
 It's just, on one way, it's just tricking us, in a way, tricking mind itself by the creator, by

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:55.000
 mind itself.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 When you discover that natural, exactly as it is, is, and then there is the enlightenment status.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 And see, the mind is the only, only the source of everything.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 The mind itself is free from the trivialities, subject and object, the inner quality realization.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 That is the mind-only school and the relatively enlightenment qualities.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.110
 And then we move to the Mahayana schools, such as all the Mademaka schools, Mademaka, which is,

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:29.000
 again, the second Mahayana schools.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:36.130
 And their realization is totally, again, free from all the emptiness, free from all the complexity

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:37.000
 status.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:45.090
 Everything is free. Everything, subject and object, everything, extremely, every kind of negation,

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:51.000
 every positive, whatever we call and grasp, cleanly, is free totally.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:57.610
 And then, even the mind itself is totally free from anything existing and relaxing that natural

00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:02.000
 state and then discovered in the realization of the true nature.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 And then we move to the like, such as like, like Kriya Tantra, outer Tantras, three outer Tantras.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:17.090
 And again, then Kriya Tantra, inner three outer Tantra or inner Tantra, all is known as then the V

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:19.000
aidhyana teachings.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 This is all Vaidhyana teachings.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:27.220
 And from this Vaidhyana teaching, what we learned, and instantly we see is all display of the

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:29.000
 nature of the mind.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
 Everything is a display of the nature of the mind.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
 Mind is already in like the state.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
 Therefore, it is a display, emanation, is totally enlightened status.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 There's nothing is really obscured that.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:49.730
 And with that kind of as a foundation, but then it applies practices as a, as a Buddhas, such as a

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:53.000
 three Buddhas or whatever the Buddha practices.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:00.000
 And we get those Buddhas right in front of us as our great teacher, as a Buddha.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:06.000
 And we want some as the obstacle beings for the time being until we get that realization.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:18.140
 As like, like, as like a principal, DTO, as always in the teaching, said as a great teacher, we

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:20.000
 would like the DTS in front of us.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:27.500
 And then ourself as the, as the beginning practitioners, as like kind of that with great honor and

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:30.000
 respect, respect we practice.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.430
 And then we did, with their blessings, with the blessings of the Buddhas in light beings, then

00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:40.000
 eventually then we reach that similar realization of that Buddha what we practice.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 Practice. Those are basically outer Tantras, ideas, ideas. And then we move to the inner Tantras.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:54.400
 In that mantra, Mahayoga, Anoyoga, we move. Mahayoga and Anoyoga teachings are inner Tantra

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:55.000
 teachings.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 And which is, again, a similar idea. Everything is display of the true nature of the mind.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:11.000
 Everything is enlightened status. Pong, song, space, mind, all are enlightened status.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:18.110
 There's nothing is not enlightened status. There's nothing really need anything to change in its

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:19.000
 styles.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 Except we have to rest on it, reconnect it as natural as it is. With that is what we need to do.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.700
 That's what the teaching says. We continually meditate and practice that. And this meditation has

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:33.000
 then two things.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:39.680
 Generally, those are known as then, visualization practice of the creative status, and complete

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:42.000
 study practice of the dissolved study practice.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:49.000
 Those are two things in one. In one, two kind of study practices that apply.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:56.050
 With that practice, we reach the realization of the true nature. Nature, or as it is, total

00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:59.000
 enlightened status, that we achieved.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:07.300
 These practices, generally now, these practices, the visualization of the practical practices, what

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:08.000
 is this?

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 This is, then, we need this follow with sadness and stuckness, particularly ceremony things.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:24.560
 And again, dissolved study practices of the complete study practices is like, this is zukki

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.000
 practices.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:32.000
 Zukki practices, there's nothing more particular need, ceremony, ritual things, too much.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 Even though there is something of the ritual ceremonies, but not too much involved.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.730
 Once you got the realization, or once you got to introduce the nature of the mind, or once you

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:49.000
 received enlightened that teaching of the zukki, then you practice.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 You practice it, practicing of this tutu, practice it with poor abiding techniques.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:01.520
 Those are known as then, the mountain-like abiding, ocean-like abiding, and then display, or the

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:06.000
 perception as, like, abiding as perceptive as it is.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000
 And then abiding, everything is within the center state of the raka, raka state.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:19.980
 So, poor abiding techniques, discovering any nature as it is, without disregarding or accepting

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:23.000
 anything, be as in that nature status.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:30.110
 Those are the tutu practices. All the toga practices within four different regions, techniques, as

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:34.000
 you introduced, and you got the realization, one after another that.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 There's nothing too much involved of the ritual ceremonies.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:48.230
 And now, these zukki practices, the teachings that we received so many times, again, throughout the

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:54.000
 teaching, we always, you receive, or we give the teachings on the zukki, one after another.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:00.320
 We give the teachings on the will, we give the teachings on the meditation, we give the teachings

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:03.000
 on the conduct, and resolve things.
