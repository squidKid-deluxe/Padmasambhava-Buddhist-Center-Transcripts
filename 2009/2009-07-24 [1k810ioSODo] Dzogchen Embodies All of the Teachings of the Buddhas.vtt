00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.070
 This is the teaching of Dzogchen, and the Dzogchen teaching is known as the embodiment of all of

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:09.600
 the Buddha's teachings.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:16.880
 Dzogchen is the essential teaching of entire Buddha's teachings. So therefore, Dzogchen embodies

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.400
 all of the teachings.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:30.460
 And that was also said in one of the great Dzogchen teachings known as Yapar Chalaam. In that

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:36.800
 teaching also said that Dzogchen is the embodiment of the primordial wisdom of all the Buddha's.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:45.440
 So that means, all the teachings, for example Nayana teachings, all the teachings of the different

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:52.600
 schools, teaching is exposed, or can reflect from the primordial wisdom.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:59.530
 So therefore, every teaching is the race of the primordial wisdom, or the light of the primordial

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.200
 wisdom. That light came from the primordial wisdom.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.400
 Dzogchen is the center of that primordial wisdom.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:13.770
 Therefore Dzogchen encompasses entire teachings. And so, in that case, in that reason, he is a

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.000
 great master, for example, a hippo Dzogchen.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.680
 He is also very humble and very simple. And he has also respected all the teachings of the Tibetan

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:25.600
 Buddhists.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.570
 In particular, that time, as we said the other day, and as we know, that time there are so many

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.800
 different new schools that develop with great excitements and great enthusiasm.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:43.350
 And even though he himself is one of the leading Dzogchen practitioners, Dzogchen masters, but he

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.400
 respected and appreciated all those teachings.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:53.320
 Therefore, since Dzogchen embodies all those teachings, and he understands, he realizes that. And

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.970
 therefore, he respects and appreciates all these teachings and attracts the courtesans, such as

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.200
 from the Mahamudar schools, or the masters of the Mahamudar schools.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:11.290
 As well as then, also as Kondayyini, which is the renowned guru of the Saka schools of the Tibetan

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:18.400
 Buddhists, or the Lamras, and then Rohan, which is another one-taste guru.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:25.570
 And as well as then, J.D., or the Parthama Sahaja's teachings, or the Mahatma's teachings. I mean,

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.280
 so forth, all those teachings, he typed the quotations, for example, as you all see here, how he

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.800
 was appreciating.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.000
 And all those are not really contrary to any teaching. All those are the teachings of the Buddha.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.800
 That's what he would like to prove.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.130
 And all those, when you apply those teachings, it merges to the heart of the Dzogchen teaching. It

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.400
 is practice. It is Dzogchen teaching.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.850
 And generally, for that reason, again, great master, Mahamud also said it. And there are so many

00:02:53.850 --> 00:03:01.590
 different schools and views developed, or expanded, not developed, expanded from the Dzocci's

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.400
 school, Dzocci's teachings of the mind sections.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.950
 Dzocci has three sections, mind sections, and the space sections, and as well as the pit, as you're

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.400
 talking, sections.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:20.640
 So this Ronyan and Mahamudra, as well as this laundry, all those are a variety of different aspects

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.400
 of these mind sections of the Dzocci's teaching.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:32.450
 Therefore, all is, it's all teaching. It's all the same. There's nothing really any contradiction,

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.400
 any kind of references. And so that's what this great master says.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:44.020
 So we just, again, highlight of that those, his intention, his will, and as well as the nature of

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.400
 the teaching, his son or the Buddha teaching.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.400
 And with that, then again, we follow this teaching.
