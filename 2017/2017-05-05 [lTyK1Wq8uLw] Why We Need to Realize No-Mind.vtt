00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
 "When one opens up another's, and that's the time we discuss of the relaxing or the

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:14.400
 purification of the mind. And that purification of the mind, we discuss it also where is mind?

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:23.000
 What is mind? Why we need to do this in this talk? Because, by the time our Salvo, everyone

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.960
 is really clinging on the mind, something that exists. Not just clinging with

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:41.360
 a truly existing mind. So that's what we investigate. Where is that mind? We think that mind is.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:49.340
 Where is that mind? Where is it coming? Where is it going? Where is it? Or in the contrast of the

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.560
 three times.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:57.400
 So we look at that. Again, everyone is trying to make clear this. This is, again, when we

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:04.600
 investigate, there is no mind. What is this? What is this generally in the Buddha's teaching?

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:13.560
 That we all know. There is true truth. Absolute truth, relative truth. It's, again, very spiritual,

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:23.400
 beautiful Buddha pointed out, as nature has, as nature has, relative truth and absolute truth.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:34.600
 So when we are discovering mind, no mind is absolute truth. That is absolute truth. On the relative

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.400
 truth, we have mind.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:45.170
 These conceptions are a chain, endless chain of conceptions, arising, analyzing, thinking. All that

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.400
, we have that.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:55.400
 Nobody, even Buddha, never, we cannot say, we don't have mind in the relative truth. We have mind.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:03.400
 That's what mind is doing. But what we have mind is also never separated from the emptiness mind.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:11.120
 Each of those subtle thoughts, each of those conceptions, I have used as a chain of the conceptions

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.400
.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:19.840
 Every instant chain of conceptions are emptiness. And therefore, what the gracious teacher, Buddha

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.400
 pointed out,

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:27.400
 relative truth is one with absolute truth. Absolute truth is one with relative truth.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:36.330
 That's what is known as union. If you look, mind is here. We have to talk and be thinking, all

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.400
 these things.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:47.470
 But then, where is that? There is no mind. This no mind and this conceptual mind is in several

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:48.400
 stages.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:57.670
 So this is why we need to break up no mind. Because all the sentient beings are so grasping and

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.400
 clinging on that outer coming,

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:09.400
 that display of the mind. We are clinging. We are grasping. We are carried by that force.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:16.400
 Force, and we have to get that in the way out. Buddha is pointing out.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.400
 Hey, there is no mind. Actually, reality is left.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:28.720
 Every chain of the mind, every instant mind that what we see, we think, is instantly, at that very

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.400
 moment, is empty.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:36.400
 That worry is not just a moment, maybe. That worry is emptiness.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:43.400
 That's why, for that reason, as I said the other day, the gracious teacher, Nagarjuna said,

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:50.400
 "See, how amazing. It is more amazing than the amazing. More marvelous than marvelous."

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:59.650
 Think of those days. Truly, it's pointing out directly where nature is, where it is, not covered by

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:00.400
 that.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:06.400
 So this is what we did. This is not what we did. According to instruction, we follow with this

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.400
 coming, going, existing mind.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:16.400
 Every second, what we found, what we found, we found no mind or emptiness mind.

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:23.400
 We are pointing out of this mind, we discover this nature of the mind, that according to Buddhism.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:31.400
 It's called discovering the emptiness by analytics. It's analytics.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:38.400
 Of course, it is more sophisticated, more detailed, those logic, the reason, the teaching method.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:45.680
 When we are talking approach, more people, more direct approach, approaching, approaching, we

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.400
 discuss, we investigate, analyze.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:56.400
 That is the analytical way. And also, sometimes, the name is theoretically, or theoretically,

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.400
 understand.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:07.400
 What it does, it helps us to where things are. That analytic is very connected to that.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:13.400
 It's connected to where the nature is, the true analytics, what we did.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:22.400
 So we discover there is no mind. That is what we, each of our intelligence, we use and point.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:31.530
 And let me, because of that, as stepping stones, used as stepping stones, then we look to our own

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:32.400
 mind.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:40.400
 When we meditate, as the gracious teacher, his only thing we point out is beyond the three times.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:45.400
 Past and the past, future has not yet arrived, and the person, kind of,

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:52.400
 provided purpose and just be most of the finest, the subtlest of the ones, and see what is there.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:59.400
 When you see what we see, or what we see, there is nothing to see.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:05.400
 Oh, I have used also what some great masters say, looking to the lookers.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:11.400
 When you look to the looking to the lookers, what do we see?

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.400
 There is nothing that we can hope.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:23.400
 In that realization, according to Dokti teaching, it is known as self-awareness view.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:31.960
 Self-awareness view, that is not an analytic, that is directly you are or we are beholding where

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.400
 the nature is,

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.400
 where the dharmakai is. That is dharmakai.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:40.400
 For that reason, his only thing is how important we are.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:46.400
 Immediately, we can discover the dharmakaya, samadabad, the Buddha.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:53.400
 Immediately, that is dharmakai, samadabad.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:07:02.400
 So now, when you recognize that, when we discover realizations, when you go, that is realizations,

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.400
 that realization.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:08.400
 But to be honest, realization is not enough due to our habit pattern.

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:13.400
 It is a small window of light of the cloud's path, and you see the blue sky.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:17.400
 But generally, we have thick clouds of the sky.

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:26.340
 And immediately, again, clouds will come and cover the sky and block the beautiful beauty of the

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:28.400
 sky or the sun.

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:34.400
 So, what is the great mass? Realization, understanding, or realization is not enough.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:39.400
 We have to be meditated. We have to meditate.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:43.400
 Meditating is what, in the teaching said, I said the other two.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:48.400
 The other day, I mentioned that meditation is not just making something.

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:53.400
 Are you making or are we making familiar of the world and nature?

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.400
 We are making familiar.

00:07:55.400 --> 00:08:02.400
 Even nature is so long, with us, from the biggest time, this dharmakai nature is.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:08.400
 But we look the narrow direction, wrong direction.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:18.400
 We delude. We mad because by the deception of the delusions, we mad our own nature as aliens.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.400
 We mad that. We have to make familiar.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:27.400
 So, that's called meditation. In the teaching said, gongamai, gongbai.

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:30.400
 Meditation is not enough just only.

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:36.400
 We have to do continuations, continuations, meditating.

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:42.400
 And because the thick cloud of the duality is covered us, we have to do continuations.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:47.400
 And look and read the life story of those great masters.

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:55.400
 And how many years they practiced in the cave, not just once in a while, in a day,

00:08:55.400 --> 00:09:03.400
 or once in a while, in weeks, once in a while, in months, or thought, half an hour at that.

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:16.400
 They practiced it. Like many years in the cave, in the mountain, really, they did it.

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:20.400
 And read the life story of the great master, Malarikas.

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:24.400
 Read the life story of the great master, Nkimbas.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:29.400
 Read the life story of the great master, Njimma Nkimbas.

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:33.400
 And read the life story of the great master, Malarikas.

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:36.400
 How many they practiced in Malarikas.

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:39.400
 And read the life story of the powerful, Nkimbas.

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:42.400
 Really, they practiced. That means they practiced it.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:49.400
 Ultimately, what we are discussing here, they didn't do anything else than what we are discussing,

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:52.400
 what we are going through today. They are teaching us.

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:56.400
 This teaching is not just the intellectually covered teaching.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:01.400
 This is realization as what they realized and they taught.

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:04.400
 Told. That's what Buddha did.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:10.400
 Buddha not just speaking and lecturing, can't do something, what's suitable with that.

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:13.400
 Exactly what they realized by the Buddha Chakra himself.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:17.400
 And he shared that knowledge, shared that wisdom through the compassion,

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:23.400
 or infinite compassion, compassion and loving kindness that they practiced.

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:30.400
 Then, by practicing, even Buddha Chakra money, for example, that we all know.

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:36.400
 He did six-year ascetic practices. Six-year ascetic practices.

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:41.400
 That's what the teachings say. And then become the Buddha.

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:48.400
 But according to that, there's many different ways to understand and explore these meanings

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.400
 according to teachings.

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:58.400
 But that's what… but how even, of course, Zobti teaching is very special.

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:05.400
 We have… first of all, we met Zobti teaching because of our 14 karmic connections.

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:10.400
 That means Zobti teaching belongs to each of us.

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:22.400
 This is really… this is our… what's called… policy of grandparents' heritage, that heritage.

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:26.400
 In a way, it is our inheritance. We connect to this.

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.400
 That means we're quite fortunate.

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:33.400
 So we really motivated the good and we really will get some good result.

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:37.400
 Even we didn't get enlightenment, even it didn't become as unchi,

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:45.400
 but even it didn't become as part… as the great Master Padrum himself said,

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:49.400
 that if you practice the method, even you didn't get enlightenment this lifetime,

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:57.400
 but still you will leave this world with happy and joy, with your goals.

00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:01.400
 Really, that's what he gets. And that's what I witnessed to you, myself.

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:08.400
 Those great practitioners really left this world with full of joy and happy, peaceful,

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.400
 and no worries, nothing really strange.

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:16.400
 Left a blue way as bird in the sky. Really put it there.

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:19.400
 That's how. This is what the practice is.

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:22.400
 So now to put this practice in action.
