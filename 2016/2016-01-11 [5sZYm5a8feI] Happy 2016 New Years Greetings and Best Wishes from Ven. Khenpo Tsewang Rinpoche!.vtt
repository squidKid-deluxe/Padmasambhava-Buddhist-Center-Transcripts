 "Good morning and Happy New Year and I wish you all the best and happy New Year, joy, peace,

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:37.360
 love, realization and prosperity and peace and harmony in heart and I wish also peace and harmony

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.540
 to the whole, normal nature, disaster and prosperity, all pacified to the power of all aspirations

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:39.140
 and prayers and you and your best wishes, at least, and I'm looking forward for this this year, yet

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.800
 to 2016 as one of the beautiful new years."

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:57.800
 "Thank you and thank you to the Thakideleks, the Thakideleks, and the Thakideleks."
