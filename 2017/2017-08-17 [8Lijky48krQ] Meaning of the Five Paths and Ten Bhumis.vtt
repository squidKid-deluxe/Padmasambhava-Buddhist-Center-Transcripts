00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.970
 When you are practicing or when practicing, practicing of the Pandya Paramata, how are we advancing

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.000
? How are we developing?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 This is like a marked sign road. If we are going to do the New York City or the Washington DC,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 we have the map and indicated where you arrived, where you are now, where you are now.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.650
 And so, that is really the indication that this is known as the hidden meaning of the Pandya Param

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.000
ata.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 Openly here, Buddha did not explain those Five Paths here when he told them. Openly did.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 But this is the hidden meaning of the Pandya Paramata. And that's why, for example, you heard that

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 the Pandya Paramata has two meanings.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 The profound meaning, vastness meaning. V-A-S-T. Vastness meaning.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 The profound meaning of the Pandya Paramata is profound, it is a great emptiness, great nature.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 That nature of the Pandya Paramata is directly of the meaning of the Pandya Paramata is profound.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 That meaning is very much clarified, highlighted by the great Master Nagarjuna.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:36.160
 Nagarjuna becomes the most famous Master who expounded the meaning of the Pandya Paramata, more

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.000
 highlighted.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 And that is then the essence of the Pandya Paramata teaching is the Madhyamaka.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 Madhyamaka, middle meaning. Middle meaning means not pulling any extremes.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:57.360
 We sent in beings, we live in beings, or we mean beings are always tendency and we do, always to

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.000
 the extremes.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 Whatever it is, we hardly stay balanced. It is our ego tricks.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 Ego itself is unbalanced because it is grasping, clinging.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 And then from there, then we don't really balance it.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 We are always in extremes, very extremes.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 And then those old words people use here, what is called? Supremacy? White supremacy.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 Well, those whites, I shouldn't say that white.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 And I shouldn't say any color.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 And supremacy? What?

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 Supremacy, what is it? Or they are very racist, racist, racist.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 All those are extreme. I mean, these old things are extreme.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 This is just the tip of the iceberg of the extreme attitude we have.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 We have so many extremes.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 Because of that extreme, we created so many troubles to the others.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 And then, mostly, it is burden to our own self. We create.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 So we really don't go always in the middle.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 Middle remains completely balanced.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 Not any extremes. Neither side. Right side or left side. You are in the center.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 For example, in the teaching, you say, when you ride the horse,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 unless you are like gymnast through those horse legs, but when you ride the horse,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 you shouldn't leave right side or left side, stay on the horse.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 And then it will be smooth. Smooth, that's just examples.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 So, now you know, this board up, this great,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 this exactly direct meaning of the Pandya Paravata,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 and known as Madhyavaka teachings.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 And then, hidden meaning of the Pandya Paravata teachings,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 who described by the great master, Ashenda.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 Ashenda is very famous. Many of you know already.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 He is one of the great masters of India.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 And he was so, in the teaching, he said, I mean, you know,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 he was so curious to see the meaning of this, behind meaning.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 If you do this meditation practice, what are you going to really achieve?

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 What are you going to see? What are you going to have some,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 that tangible we can experience in a way,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 external or in our mental state also?

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 What are we going to see?

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 So, if you want to mini-grade, masters ask one after another,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 and there's nothing really answered here that satisfies.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 And everyone says, if you like to know the ultimate meaning,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 you have to practice it.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 Maitriya, Maitriya, the future mother. Maitriya, practice Maitriya.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 And he received the instruction in teaching in empowerment,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 and then he practiced Maitriya.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 And finally, he was able to meet or see the Maitriya,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 and Maitriya gave the teachings of the hidden meaning of the Pandya Paravata.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 And the hidden meaning of the Pandya Paravata, what is it?

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 Then, these five parts, ten bhoomis, all the qualities of the...

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 When you practice the Meridim, your practice is going right, beautiful directions.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 Really, there's so many realizations or richness that are coming out,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 one after another.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 One after another, so many richness of our inner quality, of the beauty.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
 Those are doki teaching, what is known as,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 subcontinent, inherited richness of the nature of the ruka.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 This now, everything is in ruka, in a doki level.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 Everything is all underneath of the dualities.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 It's completely covered.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 But when you begin to practice this,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 when as much as you lighten up your duality cover-up of Harvekehudr,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 that much you're revealing the trails, one after another.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 Those principle trails of the ruka or the nature,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 by practicing Pandya Paravata, what is, loving-kindness, compassion,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 versatile, shining, that is the principle.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 To combination of those, so many beauties,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 so many goods, joy, devotion, calm, peaceful, realization,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 and really, just every lash of all the beauty scholars from the mind,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 this arising and reflecting, coming out, coming, and not just with that.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 Then, as we talk, then you begin to discover the five-part point,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 exactly as it is yourself, not just the imagination,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 thinking of the intellectual.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 You begin to discover the five-part point, what we discuss.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 Exactly that. And then all the sub-bokaya disciplines.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 So those are known as, to just advance it, those are known as five-part,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 and then ten-bomins. And that allows all that connected.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 Five-part and ten-bomins are not externally located objects.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 All is measured to our inner development of the meditation or the practices.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 So it's not outside. We're not talking any day about five-part or ten-bomins.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 It's all, and what is also in the teaching set?

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 Part-bomins, realizations are synonyms. Part-bomins, realizations are synonyms.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:02.000
 You got the realization, then you are achieving those different spheres.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
 And that is started from the minimums.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 Because the growth of the realization, it starts from the minimums.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:18.000
 From minimum to the middle and then to the ultimate maximums.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:27.000
 That is how the realization grows from small to wide, as wide and wide.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 So everything that realization is, is the greatest teacher, brother chapter many,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 all explained, so detailed.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:47.000
 And those are then known as highlight, again, group, group of those, five-part, ten-bomins.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 Each of those has so many details, details.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 And each of those, also when you are advancing, not always easy advancing.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 There is challenges. There is difficulties.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 Those are known as four-demons. Those are also highlight of it.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 But there is also division of those five-part-demons.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 These four-demons are not externally existing, again, demons.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:27.000
 This time, this four-demons are all connected with ego clinging and grasping.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 Grasping, clinging.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 When we are moving forward from the ego clinging,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 due to the happy dependence, there is not many times kind of clashes in the way.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 Clashes, interference, one's own ego clinging,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 one's own measurable structure, become the obstacle to our own advancing, advancing.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
 So this means, external is nothing coming in the way.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 Maybe it could explain some conditions, external, reality, all is happening,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000
 happening and performing by the mind. We are advancing.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000
 So therefore, again, that is the general kind of ideas of the five parts.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.440
 So let me again, this is--
