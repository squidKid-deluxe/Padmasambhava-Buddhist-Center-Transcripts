00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.920
 Not any kind of hot and diseased, anything that will relax on that surface or this natural surface,

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.000
 just be in that spot.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 That's what mentioned again in the video.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 You may go back to Dzogchen, and that is the grip of the Dzogchen.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 The grip of this Dzogchen.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 Now, look, Dzogchen has still a heart attack, and the kid doesn't have anything.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 And the whole thing comes, and we don't hold on to that.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 We don't follow that thought.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 Thought is immediately going to its another nature status.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 It just immediately went back to the nature.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 And that is, if we don't regulate that thought, it just goes back to its own nature status.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 And that is known as self-liberation.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 We don't have to make any effort to make it.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 Change that. Just leave alone.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 [Hindi]

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 Self-liberation and self-liberation or release of the snack is not locked by a smelly sock.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 You will use those methods to explain this.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 [Hindi]

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 And we form constant thoughts that we all know that.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 We follow our thoughts.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 That means we are energizing, we think, we're doing something, more expanding on that thought.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 That is called following thought, explaining it.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 And that thought then becomes, if the grass is clean,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 that is known as making, in the teaching of the state, illusions.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 He's cleaning.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 He's cleaning.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 And what mind is doing, because the grass is cleaning, that's why it's called illusion.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 [Hindi]

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 And for the nature of the mind is always filled from within, often said.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 It's filled from the within, within.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 And for the mind, I should ask that nature status,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 what do it always in the teaching say, one after the other, say,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 "Look to your mind by yourself."

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 Not keep on.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 "Look to your mind by yourself."

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 That is, it's very, sometimes, happen,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 but yet it remains all the way, way to usher us back to the nature.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 Nature, nature.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 When you look to your mind, or when we look to our mind,
