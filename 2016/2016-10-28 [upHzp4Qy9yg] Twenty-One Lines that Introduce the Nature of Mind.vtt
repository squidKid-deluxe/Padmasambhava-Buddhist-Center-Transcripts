00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.400
 If you look to that, in a way, you're investigating it three times, past, present, and future.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:18.460
 Past and present and future. And so, now we're applying that to the mind, where mind came, came in

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.680
 the past.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:32.000
 Past, where mind stayed in the past, where mind went in the past. And we ask those questions as

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.880
 greater in the teaching sense.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:43.780
 There's nothing we have answered. Each question we answer will be speechless. Each of those speech

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.520
less answers.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:55.600
 Now we think of a future, for example, where future mind was going to come, and where future mind

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.680
 will stay,

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:07.520
 and where future mind will go. Again, it's speechless. Now we'll think of the present.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:15.600
 The present is right here, with us. Past is vast. It's gone. That's what's called past. Future is

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.280
 not yet alive.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.280
 That's what's called future. The present, we all think, is here. It's true. The present is here.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:30.220
 That is something that's reachable with us. So, now we're going to think of our present, where the

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.000
 present mind is coming.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:43.180
 We think again. Within the present, we divide again three. Where the present mind is came or coming

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.760
.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:54.080
 Where the present mind is now. Where the present mind is going.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:04.030
 And when we ask that question again to us, each time is speechless. There's nothing really we can

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.200
 answer.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:14.480
 So, that means there is no mind. Reality level, there's no mind. No mind as we believe.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:24.960
 Believed mind, something exists. There's no mind as what we believed. We're looking now with our

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.960
 own intelligence.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:37.760
 Our own mind, with our own, to our own mind. To our mind, with our mind. By ourself.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:47.520
 So then, therefore, it is called emptiness mind. This mind, emptiness.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:55.200
 Also known as, this emptiness of the mind is the source of all this discipline.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:03.040
 As we went, as I said, all the samsara came from this emptiness mind.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:12.720
 And nirvana coming from this emptiness mind. Yet, mind is emptiness. That's how mind is.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:21.120
 And therefore, sense of this comes from all from the mind in emptiness, samsara. Samsara is empty.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:29.520
 Sense of nirvana comes from the mind and nirvana is empty. Therefore, samsara is illusion.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:37.620
 Nirvana is illusion. It's all know it. It's in the illusion level, it's the same. There's no

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:38.480
 difference.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:46.400
 However, samsara is, then, that means what samsara means, grasping and cling.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.200
 That is samsara. Such as, again, you can't keep up with the gharamu. You use it many times.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:04:00.480
 That this, by the mohoram bhudjicthi, he said, there is no samsara beyond dualities or grasping.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:06.140
 That's what the mohoram bhudjicthi said. As the kijiram bhudjicthi kiram bhudjicthi, many times he

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.120
 said,

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.240
 there's samsara, there is no samsara beyond grasping.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:21.120
 Grasping is duality, samsaras. What is we grasping? We grasping something that is not existing.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:29.200
 That is wrong. That is a mistake. That is a double miracle. That means troubles.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:37.200
 With grasping and clinging, something will not exist. That's how we, something that is not existing

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.200
,

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:46.080
 we grasping, we clinging, we hope. Hope. And the reality level, grasping, every nature is changing,

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:54.000
 but still we hope, still we're grasping. That is what really all these troubles.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:01.200
 And this nirvana, no grasping, no clinging, even the display. Therefore, nirvana is, what in the

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.840
 teachings,

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:09.520
 nirvana is comfortable, nirvana is relaxed, nirvana is pure, nirvana is just completely everything,

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:17.760
 isn't comfort and all that, because it not comes from the grasping, not developed the grasping.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:26.220
 It's developed by the true love, true compassion, true wisdom, that has no conversation of the dual

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:27.600
ities.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:35.120
 Infinite love, infinite compassion, infinite wisdom, combination of that display arises.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:43.440
 And therefore, everything is so beautiful, pure, perfect, and all those nirvana explanations,

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.720
 or the pure land, such as pure land explanations. That is what it is.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:55.680
 So therefore, now, by knowing this, now we, with this, now mind is empty.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:02.560
 And also, his mind is not just an empty, blank status. Emptiness is a conception.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:08.880
 That is our conception of duality. We can't really kind of handle too much.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:13.360
 So therefore, just we have to say emptiness. But reality level,

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:21.040
 nature, mind is beyond of the emptiness and not emptiness. This is beyond that.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:29.760
 Notion of emptiness is kind of more negation. Negation is not nature. Negation is dualities.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:38.640
 Negation is grasping. Negation is extremes. Nature is not.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:47.680
 For that reason, what it teaches is beyond. Beyond the emptiness and non-emptiness.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:54.560
 That is what the nature of the mind is. Now, with that understanding, we now do the practices.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.120
 And this--
