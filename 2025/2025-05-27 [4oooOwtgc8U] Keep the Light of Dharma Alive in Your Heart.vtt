00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.760
 morning. And then Samaya, of course, you all know, you're all being practicing Vaidhyana and there

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:07.500
 is so many

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:14.580
 important teachings from many great masters, one after another. And everyone, I'm sure, explaining

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:21.110
 about the Samayas. Samayas, and this is the part of them, the how to uphold the teachings. Of

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:21.300
 course,

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.640
 of course, it's so important to receive the teachings in parliament. The second is the most

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:35.660
 important is practicing upholding the teaching. The Samaya is upholding the teaching. Samaya is

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:44.120
 also our conduct, how we're going to maintain. And always we heard in the teaching, thank you,

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:53.680
 always we heard the teaching, the woo, meditation and conduct. Woo in meditation, woo is the

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:00.400
 visualization or meditation or whatever. And then meditation is to keeping up what do you

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:07.000
 deserve or what do you use? What do you learn? Keeping up that is the meditation and practices.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:16.520
 And then third one is the conduct. Conduct and meditation goes side by side. Conduct is not one

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:24.600
 direction and meditation practice or other side. Combined target. There is a conduct and Samaya

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:31.040
 during the meditation practices. There is a conduct and Samaya in the post-meditations.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:40.000
 Both time is Samaya. Samaya is Sanskrit word in Vaidhyana terminology, but it's a use,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.760
 your is a conduct. Keeping up our commitment and keeping out our courage, confidence and our

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:57.040
 loyalty practices. When we have that taught in the teaching office, even you receive one

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:03.560
 teaching that will bring enlightenment. Even you want teaching, one practice, one empowerment,

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.380
 really will bring. If we don't keep the conduct, if we don't keep up, if we receive hundreds of

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.560
 that,

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:17.160
 it won't bring enlightenment. Of course, blessing is so good, but it's not going to bring poor

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.480
 realization. So therefore, the Samaya is so important. And I will summarize all the Samayas

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:32.240
 as in Bodhijata. Keep the Bodhijata practice. Keep the Bodhijata, relative Bodhijata, and keep the

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:39.840
 absolute Bodhijata for the combined target. Then with the devotion, with joy, with the application,

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:46.560
 and then the practice, whatever you can while practicing. And that practice is, is the big,

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:53.360
 become the embodiment of all the dharmas, all the Buddhas. Buddhas in the teaching says that

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.760
 all Buddhas, the absolute level is the same. There's no difference really, Buddha. Nature is the

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:59.040
 same.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:06.960
 So we practice the one, such as, as in the teaching mentioned, embodiment of all the Buddhas. That

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:14.960
 means embodiment of peace, embodiment of peace of Buddha, embodiment of Ratha Buddha, embodiment of

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:23.540
 male Buddha, embodiment of female Buddha, embodiment of all Bodhisattvas, all in life beings,

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:24.400
 everyone.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.360
 And Gaurup M. Masambhava is the special Buddha of the Dijandaraja times. In the teaching,

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:35.120
 often he said that Gaurup M. Masambhava, because his previous commitment that when the Dijandarajan

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.120
,

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:41.440
 the troubles are approaching to different directions, if you think of the Gaurup M. Masambhava,

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.800
 in more the blessings of Gaurup M. Masambhava, Gaurup M. Masambhava blessing is so swept,

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:53.680
 and so powerful, so quick, and helps you ask. And that always teaching said, among the male Buddha,

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:00.160
 Gaurup M. Masambhava, the swept, powerful, cooking, protectors. Among the female Buddha,

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:08.080
 Madadara is swept, powerful, and heroic blessings. So this is really, so special. And particularly,

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:14.160
 can really, in the, in the keeping Samaya, just combine one practice that you can keep, along with

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:21.520
 some other practice that you do, but the mostly important, keep the practice every day. Keep,

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:31.440
 keep the light every day. Keep that light always candleing, always not let that go away. Keep that,

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:39.200
 doesn't matter how long you practice it, keep the light every day. And as like, there's always,

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:45.920
 there's light of the, from the, from the eons, until now, there was some,

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:51.280
 sometimes says in, in the Nepal or some area, there's a like holy place, which is ancient time,

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.920
 is the part of the trade, and then now is under the Nepal, which is really, there is a light,

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:01.200
 always say that from the beginning of the eons, or the establishment of the world,

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:07.040
 there is a light that says, similarly, keep that light. Light will love, and a compare here,

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:14.640
 both each other, every day, renew that, don't let that go down, permanent this. Keep that in heart.

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:19.520
 And that will be the, our Samayas in the day practice of this Buddha Amitayya.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:26.240
 I'm going to remember some of this, we have been able to print beautiful book letters too.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.080
 So practice that, that's what teaching is. And with those thought,

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:35.360
 and repeat this, follow prayer as a Samayas.
