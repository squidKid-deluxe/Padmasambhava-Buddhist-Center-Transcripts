00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 This time appearing is compassion, compassion.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 And that also means this satyana samadhi is not negation, negative state as we discussed yesterday.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 And as you all know, basically, it's called great emptiness, great emptiness of yoga and so forth.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 But it's not negation state, emptiness that you already mind we think.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 Think, think, that is not emptiness at all.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 This emptiness is beyond duality, that's all about.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 And that great emptiness is not negation, negative, not the blank state.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 This is full of opportunity, full of energy, vitality of that.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 And this time that vitality is then compassion.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 But that vitality, that is compassion.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 And again, this compassion arises magically,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 magically as almost like breathing the wind in the space.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 This can be so soothing, calming, without any partiality, without any restrictions.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 That energy of compassion is spread out instantly to whole beings of six realms.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 Everyone touched, or that compassion touched everyone, every single living being.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 But just focus on the compassion, not individual beings.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 That power, energy is just spread out without any restrictions.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 That is known as all arising samadhi.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 That all arising samadhi and that satyana samadhi is never separated.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 Both are in one single status, status, status, just identical.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 There is no even separations.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 But yet, actively we now let a concentrate on that energy.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 This is known as then compassion that has no focus.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 That compassion that has no partiality.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 In the debate, in the teaching said mukwa mappaningi.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 Mukwa mappaningi means there is no really particular purpose.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 You just spread out that vastness, compassion, that throw out in space.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 All the space, all the universe, everything is completely filled with that great compassion.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 Compassion, you relax in that state.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 Just relax mind in that compassion status.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 This is known as then is magical.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 Sometimes in the teaching said magical samadhis.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 This magical samadhis, juma-tawatini, it is truly magical.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 It is just spread out to everyone.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 Also, it is also known as the warrior-like samadhi street, other terminologies.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 Warrior or the brave samadhi.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 Samadhi, because there is no restructure, no discrimination.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 You sending out to everyone that compassion, the great compassion.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 And this is, again, essence of the enlightenment.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 And this suchness samadhi is combined to that is the all arising samadhi.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 That is also known as union of the western and the compassion.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 That you heard many times.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 Union of the western and the compassion.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 This is, as it is, we are uniting that.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 We are kind of reigniting that.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 It is not something that is not united, we are united.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 It is that status and we are embracing that nature as it is.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 And that is known as then, this magical samadhis.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 This magical samadhi, samadhi, what it purifies.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 Immediately in the part of status, it purifies habitual patterns

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 or hindrance of the upper death.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 Death.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 After death, our course, we all know that.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 I may be all believe that.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 That after death, journey is not really stopped.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 So there is continue unfolding dreams.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 That is sometimes known as vadu of the true natural or vadu of the upper death.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 The whole universe, whole environment is begins that time.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 That time.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 Many times we grasping, we cling as subject, object.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 And then all this rejection and acceptance.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 As we play that game in our lifetime,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 we continually carry that habitual package

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 and that tool of habitual.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 And we try to apply those tools of habitual

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
 through that experience of the upper death of the vadu

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 or vadu of the upper death.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 Death.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 And then it is all different again, the vision change.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 We caught so much ups and downs.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 But when we have the realization of this magical display,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 magical display, then that turbulence of the upper death

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 is instantly pacify it.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 No more become as turbulence experience.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 It's all as dream and as display of our own nature.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 So therefore, this all arising,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 the samadhi and magical samadhi,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 whatever they owe, bravery like samadhi,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 whatever terminology we like to apply,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 it will purify the habitual patterns of the upper death.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.000
 Death experience or the death, dream of the death, upper death.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 And then also in the teachings said,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 it will also purify habitual patterns of the palm rings.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 Palm rings among the three rings,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
 desire rings, palm ring and formless ring.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 It will purify the habitual patterns of the palm ring experience.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 And then it will also bring the clear realization

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 of the Sambukaya status among the three aspects

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 of the enlightened God.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.000
 Dharmakaya, Sambukaya and Narmakayas.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 This part we will talk a little later.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 We can talk a little bit more.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 Of course, there are many books in all these days,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 but we can go a little bit later.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 There are also beautiful prayers in these texts,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 so we can maybe go a little bit later.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000
 But however, this will purify the habitual patterns

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 of the upper death or the Pardo.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
 That was normal, we called Pardo.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
 And then as well as palm rings,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 and it began to also actualizing the Sambukaya status.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:23.000
 So that is the action or purpose or the cause,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 what is about the all arising Samadhi.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 Again, when you have the time, as we say,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 try to stay meditated for a second or for a minute in that great compassion status.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 Now, once we confront that second Samadhi,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 then third Samadhi is...
