00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.700
 According to the teachings, Guru Yoga, as we said in the teachings, as I repeated, is the profound

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:19.000
 spirit part to this enlightenment.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 So therefore, Guru Yoga is a relief.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:42.550
 Because when you have the devotion, like a devotion, that mental state has no doubt and no

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.000
 hesitation, not a shaky mind.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 It is really so firm and so strong.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:57.940
 And then you see the preciousness of our situation, the circumstance and the connection to the Guru

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.000
 or lineage is so strong.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 And therefore, then realization, the inborn realization, comes so past.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.080
 Really according to the teachings, the realization of the true nature only comes from the

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:24.000
 accumulated as well as blessings of the Guru.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 Otherwise, there is no way to get realization enlightenment.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:39.590
 So this is the one in the teachings, the truth, accumulated merit practices and devotion or the

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.000
 connection to the lineage masters and the blessings.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 And that truth really will boom up the realization.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 So that is the general kind of importance of these connections to that.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 And then generally, devotion.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 Devotion is a sizzling energy of the pure heart and the pure mind.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 It comes from the origin and the actual state of the mind or the primordial essence.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 But then, even though it is so powerful, so spiritual, there is no soul that is existing.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 And there is nothing existing that.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:34.220
 When you look to that, nature is already in the great jockeying status, already in the great jocke

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.000
ying status.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:46.700
 So for that reason, the great master, Raga Aksi, mentioned that during your meditation, when you

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:47.000
 are meditating for quite a few hours of use,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:56.130
 sometimes our mind becomes dull and sleepy and soggy, and the mind is disturbed by the meditation,

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.000
 such as what?

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 Those skated mind or very dull mind or sleepy mind, disturbed, to clear up that.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 And what is great is Master Raga Aksi.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:16.320
 Sometimes you should invoke the kindness and good quality or devotion to the gurus, really bring up

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.000
 that.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:26.140
 During that time, just a short, maybe one minute, and if you bring up that, it really will clear up

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.000
 those kind of poggy thoughts and all that.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 It refreshes our meditation and then look to your mind.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.940
 Look to your own mind, Rava, and there is no soul that is already in the jockeying status and med

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.000
itating.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 So therefore, devotion is the energy of the realization.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 All devotion is the vapor or mystery of the realization of the spring, if I use it that way.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 It is really good, but yet it is all in the state of the Ropa.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 It comes from Ropa. It is merely from Ropa.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 Therefore, devotion is very activated to speed up, to boost up the realization.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 According to teaching, devotion in the body goes side by side.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 Thank you.
