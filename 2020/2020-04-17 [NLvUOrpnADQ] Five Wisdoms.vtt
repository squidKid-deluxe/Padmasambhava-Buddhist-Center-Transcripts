00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 Thank you very much everyone. Again, good afternoon. Welcome everyone. Welcome. Thank you.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 Again, we will do some, again, some teachings and touch best on this teaching.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 We will be going on by Chabjie, the new Rinpoche, and so then we go over this.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 In order to begin that, again, we are not going to forget about the best, our home best,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 and which is the motivation, and that is beautiful motivation.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 We have to activate our beautiful motivation of the dual and the appreciation, bodhijata,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.380
 and then Vadiyana, purity, or the three-vadial state, those kind of understanding, or the

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:55.000
 realization,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 kind of truly activated, sizzling status. Then we begin to reflect on the teachings.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 And what we are going to be doing is what the traditional teacher, Buddha, is teaching,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 always mentioned, studying and contemplating and practicing, meditating.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 We are doing that all these three things, three are targeted in these two and a half hours

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 or two hour sessions. What are we doing? So really, we are doing beautiful, according to Buddhism.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 It is wonderful. During that time, we are cultivating our beautiful motivation.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 This is known as power of the mind. We are activating that. So therefore, it is so beautiful.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 And again, with that, then we go to this teaching.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 Now, on the teaching, we are talking about the three jewels.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 Three jewels is the foundation and focal point of the Buddhism.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 It doesn't matter which schools you came. Buddhism has many different schools,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 Theravadas, Sutra Mahayanas, Vedayana schools, so forth, but three jewels, it has no difference.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 Everyone follow with three jewels. This is number one.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 Same time, it is the center of columns. Not just number one, and then kind of forget that,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 it is continually carrying or during all our practices.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 And being a Buddhism, the goal is to achieve or to discover the three jewels.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 Buddha Dharmasaka. This time, of course, is our destination goal.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 At the same time, it is our focal point, our foundations.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 So now, we are talking about the three jewels.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 Among the three jewels, the Buddha Dharmasaka.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 And among the three jewels, I am talking about, as we all know, Buddha Buddha.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 Buddha means totally enlightenment. That means that the final goal of the practices

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 is preferred when you become the Buddha.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 That is the final goal. There is nothing higher for the goal.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 You achieve full, big of realization. So that is known as Buddha.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 When you become the Buddha, it is not just one individual,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 it now becomes something of a kind of higher status.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 This is what in Buddhism is called, again, continuing beginning

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 to benefit for all living beings.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 This is really truly beginning to benefit for all living beings.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 So how Buddha is going to help?

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 Benefit for beings through different emanations.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 The Buddha is going to benefit for all beings.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 First, Buddha achieved when you reach enlightenment.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 What that is known as? Reaching enlightenment as a Dharmakaya status.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 That is the ultimate goal. The Buddha himself, him or herself,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 now reaches Dharmakaya status.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 Once you achieve Dharmakaya status, now, as I said,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 you begin to benefit and helping for all living beings

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 without any discrimination until everyone works out

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 each and every one's potential for their innate nature.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 They are going to work, benefit. That is known as emanations.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 In the terminology in the teaching, it is the emanations named kayas.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 So I am talking of the kayas yesterday.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 First kaya is Buddha reaching enlightenment.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 Then the rest, all those other kayas, such as sambhokaya, Dharmakaya,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 all those are different emanations, different disciplines.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 And what is the example of that emanation in the teaching of Krenmaikhand?

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 For example, when a brilliant sun shines in the sky,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 pretty from clothes, mists, anything, those kind of turbulence, clothing, anything,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 when it shines, it will reflect that sunshine

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.000
 wherever there is any kind of circumstances and conditions,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 such as all the bones, all the legs on the earth,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 all the bones of the earth, all the mirrors,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 wherever there is no need to be shortage of the emanations.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:19.000
 It will reflect everywhere as the circumstances, conditions are occurred or are there.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 That display of the reflections of all that is known as kayas emanations.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 Dharmakaya is like sunlight, sunshine, from that emanating everywhere.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 So then we are talking about, that's what we are talking about kaya, to benefit.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 What these kayas now have, those emanations have,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 they have then five wisdom.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 Through the five wisdom, they are going to benefit for all the living beings.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 When the five wisdom, when we are talking about the five wisdom,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 that means they are ultimate state of loving kindness, compassion,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 kindness, concern, caring, common sense,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 and practical, and openness,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 respect and appreciation to every living beings.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 When Buddha help, all those emanations began helping to all the beings.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 They help according what the suits with individuals,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
 not pulsing, not imposing.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 Something that they can adjust and adapt so it will aspire

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
 and ignite their own inner glories.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 The final goal, the goal of the Buddhism or the Buddhas

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
 to help to the other beings as I said,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000
 to ignite their inner glories, inner light.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 Because this inner light or this Buddha nature is equal to every living beings.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 This is what we have to light up, lighten up.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 So these old emanations, the kayas are beginning to help with

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:23.000
 really perfect knowledge, perfect kindness and perfect wisdom.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 Those are known as five wisdom that we all know, we heard that name.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 And now the fourth wisdom, the fundraising wisdom is known as Dharmadhatu wisdom.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000
 Dharmadhatu wisdom is the ultimate wisdom of the true nature

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 of the great emptiness, openness.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 That is the original wisdom.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 From that Dharmadhatu wisdom, or Dharmadhatu maybe I can say as like

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:05.000
 great emptiness intelligence, great emptiness wisdom.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 When a great emptiness, that openness wisdom,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 then it has all those other poles, it is right there.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 All other poles such as Maryland wisdom,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:24.000
 equanimity wisdom, and discrimination awareness wisdom,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 distinctly understanding knowledge of wisdom.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 And all accomplished wisdom right within this Dharmadhatu wisdom

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
 or Maryland wisdom.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 It has all that.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 Why there is five or four of these accounts is aspect,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 different aspect of this wisdom, aspect.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 And all that is, that again our talk.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000
 As you can tell, you can say this Maryland wisdom.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 When it's Maryland wisdom, what that means is a metaphor,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 Maryland is a metaphor.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 Wisdom that likes Maryland.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 So that means within this Dharmadhatu wisdom,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
 within this Dharmadhatu wisdom,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 that everything is reflecting, reflecting.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
 True like in this Maryland,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:33.000
 surface of the Dharmadhatu wisdom has Maryland images.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 And how? The everything.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000
 That means everything whatever is existing or occurring,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 occurring, all is reflected.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000
 But that means whether the wisdom has no blockage

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 of the past, present, and future,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
 or maybe particularly past and future.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 All that is reflecting into this Maryland wisdom

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:11.000
 is like a giant, like telescopic telescope,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:17.000
 that captures the everything, everything.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 Well that means according to Buddhism, samsara, nirvana,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
 everything is, it reflects within them.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 It's like giant, narrow.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 So because of that knowledge, where it is reflecting,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 where it is shining, that, for that reason,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000
 is known as the Maryland wisdom.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
 Maryland wisdom.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
 This is again, when it is reflected,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
 then second one or third one,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
 Muslim, is an equanimity wisdom.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 Even though it is reflecting all the everything,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000
 as both samsara and nirvana, variety of the displays,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 the situational circumstances, all come.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 But when it comes to the Maryland,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 Maryland, there is nothing is different at all.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 It's within that marrow.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 Within that marrow, what marrow will have wisdom.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
 And also, it's just blended in everything.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
 There is no different compartment.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 Oh, this is samsara aspect of Maryland.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
 What's the, this is nirvana aspect of Maryland.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 What this is, ups and downs, situational circumstances,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 knowledge, what's the, this is not all blended in.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 Completely within that, there is even no different trace

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 or the marks of the different those aspects.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000
 It's completely equalized and balanced,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 blended in whatever terminology we use.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 That aspect of knowledge, wisdom, is known as equanimity,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
 wisdom.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 Even the next one, third one,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 is discrimination, awareness, wisdom.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
 That's why I'm also translating.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 Distinctly, understanding clearly the knowledge

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 or wisdom, that knowledge.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
 And that means, even though it's blended in,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 every day is complete, there is no different compartment.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 Compartment, all in the marrow,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 the wisdom or the dharmada, the wisdom, there is nothing.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
 But yet, everything is clearly understanding everything.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 So thoroughly, so precise, so subtle, so final.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 Everything understands.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
 There was nothing that captures everything.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000
 Of the past, future, detail, everything.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 So clearly, distantly, the teachings say that,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 that put me, I say like maybe I use the example of the marble,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 the crystal marble.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
 If you put on your own palm,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 you can see clearly, thoroughly, everything.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
 Like that, every knowledge of the objects,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 both samsara and nirvana,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 are so precisely, so clearly,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
 so subtle, so detailed, so final.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 And that's what's really known as

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 the distinctively, clearly, understanding the wisdom.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 Everything, so detailed, so thought.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
 Not kind of overcast it,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
 or kind of like overlap each other.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 Everything details of that.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 That is known as the discrimination,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 awareness, wisdom.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
 Or distinctively, distinctly, understanding wisdom.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000
 Or clearly, knowing wisdom.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 And the next one, or the fourth or fifth one,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000
 is all accomplishing wisdom.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 Because of that knowledge,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 because of that wisdom,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.000
 then everything is perfectly accomplishing

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 a coldness situation,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 circumstances, and everything completely,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
 fulfilling everything.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 There is no need forcing, no need to push,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 a right way to completion

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 and fulfilling all the activities.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 According to their situations,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 circumstances, capabilities, or readiness,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
 exactly where that exactly needs to be,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 fulfilling.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 And that aspect of knowledge,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 when that fulfills, which is fulfilling,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 what is the fundamental cause to fulfilling that,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 is intelligence or the wisdom.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
 And that aspect is known as

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 the all-accomplishing wisdom.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:02.000
 So that is what this, all the Buddhas,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
 above the Muslims.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 And as I said yesterday, when we talk about wisdom,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
 maybe many, many times we think,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 "Oh, this is just a wisdom, a wisdom."

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.000
 But this wisdom is completely blended up in,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 or triggered with loving kindness, compassion.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
 Compassion is completely that,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 saturated or targeted.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
 And that is the wisdom.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
 This is the wisdom.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 This wisdom can be summarized into two systems.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
 And also known as wisdom,

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000
 that understanding all the absolute truth,

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000
 exactly as it is,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
 wisdom and understanding,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
 relative truth, exactly as it is.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 And again,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 wisdom and understanding,

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 exactly the absolute truth as it is,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.000
 and wisdom and understanding,

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
 exactly relative truth as it is.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000
 So this is known as true wisdom.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
 And so that means this five wisdom

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000
 can be summarized into two systems.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.000
 That is, again,

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
 there is a different account of

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
 the great masters' interpretation,

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
 but in a simple way to tell,

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
 "Dhamma Dhatu" wisdom is a wisdom

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
 that understands the absolute truth,

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 the absolute truth, exactly as it is.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
 That is,

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
 the wisdom that understanding,

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 absolute truth as it is.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 And then as the four wisdoms,

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 such as marital and wisdom,

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
 economic and wisdoms,

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 all, and not all,

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000
 and all accomplishing wisdoms,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000
 and wisdoms that understand distinctly,

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 clearly as it is,

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 that four wisdoms are,

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000
 can be summarized within the wisdom

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 that understanding, relative truth,

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
 exactly as it is.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000
 So that is two wisdoms.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
 Simple to tell, again,

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000
 the wisdom of the absolute truth,

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 wisdom of relative truth,

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 two wisdoms.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000
 One is, two wisdoms can be summarized

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
 in one wisdoms.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
 That is, as I said,

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
 he is studying, two.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
 Two, then,

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000
 the great wisdom of the omniscient,

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
 great wisdom of the omniscient,

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 of the enlightenment.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
 That is, then,

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
 all summarized,

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
 or that is the wisdom.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000
 So that is really about the wisdoms.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000
 Again, as we spoke,

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 all the day, how we say,

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000
 when we explain about the Buddha,

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000
 the Gaias,

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
 and the wisdoms,

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000
 and the beneficial activities of the Buddha.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 Those are three women,

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000
 or I meant carnival divisions.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000
 And Gaias, or the emanations of Gaias,

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.000
 are the best of the wisdoms

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 and the beneficial activities.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
 In other words,

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000
 the beneficial activities and wisdoms

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.000
 are came because the Buddha reached

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 the Dharma-Kaya status,

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 or achieved Buddhahood.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:54.000
 Then, wisdoms and beneficial activities

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
 come spontaneously,

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000
 because that's why we spoke about the Gaias.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 And the Gaias are,

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000
 I'm translating today also, emanations.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000
 We spoke about emanations.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 Then we spoke just an hour about wisdoms.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 Now I talk really about beneficial activities.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 Benefit. So when you reach enlightenment

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000
 and become the Buddha,

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 as I said,

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000
 you begin now to benefit

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 and help all the living beings

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 to ignite their inner wisdoms

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
 or inner potentials.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000
 That is really the purpose of it.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000
 And when you reach that,

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000
 you discover each of everyone's

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 their own potentials.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 That is what is known.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000
 Then everyone becomes the Buddha.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000
 And if we didn't really discover

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000
 our potential or our Buddha nature,

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000
 then we're still struggling in samsara

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000
 and all the different challenges and difficulties.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 So to reflect clearly the suffering difficulty

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000
 is to work out our own inner nature still

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000
 and discover our own inner qualities,

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000
 our own inner richness.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000
 That's what is related,

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000
 known as the teachings of the Buddhists.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000
 So for that reason,

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000
 now sense that beings are number,

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 certain beings,

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000
 there are no numbers according Buddhism.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000
 There are so many beings.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000
 So therefore, we need always help

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000
 to all the sense beings.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000
 That's why for the level of the body of the Buddha,

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000
 and that's why Buddha carried that body of the Buddha

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.000
 and activated that with the body of the activities

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000
 and then become the Buddha Buddha,

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.000
 now the poor Buddha is going to benefit,

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000
 help to all the sense beings.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 So the other benefit of the sense beings, how?

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000
 Those are in the teachings said three ways,

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 and continuation, pervasive, and spontaneously.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:25.000
 Those are the three qualities of the way

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000
 benefitting for all the living beings.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:33.000
 Again, both is continuation.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000
 Second is, pervasive.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000
 Third is, spontaneously.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:47.000
 So those three ways Buddha is going to help to all the living beings.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000
 How?

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 What is behind is, again if I summarize,

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:59.000
 Buddha is going to benefit all those beings with loving kindness,

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000
 with compassion, loving kindness and compassion.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.000
 and wisdom and abilities, strength and power.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:12.000
 These three are the power behind

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000
 to benefit to all the beings

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 with continuation, pervasive, and spontaneously.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000
 And now, loving kindness and compassion of the Buddha

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000
 is open in the Buddha's teaching.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000
 Mention is true.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:38.000
 Buddha loves all living beings as Mother's only child.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:44.000
 Not all the living beings without any discrimination.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:50.000
 Every living Buddha loves every living being as,

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:56.000
 for example, Mother's only child.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000
 Buddha loves.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.000
 Thank you.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 How long?

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.000
 Buddha loves.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.000
 Until everyone becomes the Buddha's Lord.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.000
 Again, another order I can use,

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.000
 until they discover their own true nature,

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 Buddha loves.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000
 So that is love.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000
 The loving kindness and compassion is.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000
 Then also, how are the Buddha going to help?

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.000
 Going to help with wisdom.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.000
 And that five wisdom is making it, particularly those four wisdom,

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:39.000
 exactly going to help those beings as they need it.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:48.000
 As I said already, not pulsing, not pushing, not imposing,

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:57.000
 not convoluted, bossy, with respect, appreciation, calm, politeness.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.000
 According to their readiness, Buddha helps.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.000
 How that in the teaching said,

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:10.000
 Buddha will usher those beings on the lower ranks, three lower ranks.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:17.000
 Buddha will usher them to the higher ranks, such as human ranks.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000
 And when they go in the human realm,

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:26.000
 Buddha will usher them to the part, according to their readiness.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000
 What that means? Part.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.000
 According to Buddhism, there are three parts.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.000
 Part of the sharvaka, part of the particular Buddha,

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000
 and part of the bodhisattvas.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000
 So according to their readiness,

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.000
 Buddha will usher them to those parts.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000
 And what does that really mean?

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.000
 Again, there's nothing strange that Buddha is going to lead in different directions.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:58.000
 It's just that Buddha is going to have to touch their inner best,

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:05.000
 love and compassion according to their readiness, according to their situations.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:11.000
 So those who are like a sharvaka, they are not going to think too much of other things.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000
 According to their teaching, they're going to be thinking,

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.000
 "How are you going to come out of samsara?"

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 So Buddha will help them to come out of samsara.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000
 Those like sharvaka and both.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:30.000
 And the part of the bodhis, or the solitude of the bodhis.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:38.000
 And then in the aha-pass, so Buddha will help them to treat their desire, their interest.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.000
 Those individuals who like to benefit, not just only I like to come out of samsara,

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:48.000
 but I like to help all the sentient beings to come out of samsara.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000
 So then those are known as bodhis-samsara.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.000
 So Buddha will help to aspire according to their desire,

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.000
 to really reach themselves in enlightenment,

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:03.000
 and also to help and to aspire to benefit for all the fittings.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000
 So when they reach to that state,

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000
 how the Buddha will help according to his teaching.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:15.000
 When they reach to the sharvaka state, all the part of the Buddha state, bodhis-sato state,

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.000
 finally, whatever they will help to aspire,

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.000
 they become totally enlightened state, Buddha group.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:29.000
 So that means, from the three law realms, Buddha will aspire to the higher realms.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:34.000
 From higher realms, Buddha will aspire to the path of the sharvaka,

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:40.000
 party Buddha, and bodhis-sato, from there, Buddha will aspire to the final destination

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.000
 or fulfillment of the Buddha world states.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:47.000
 Those are in a teaching mission, how their Buddha will help.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.000
 And when Buddha help, also, on Buddha's time,

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:57.000
 the practitioners or the sentient beings are ready to need to help those beings.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:02.000
 They are ready, they are waiting for to really wake up to themselves,

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000
 to the origin state, or whatever state they like.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000
 They are ready to that.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.000
 Buddha will be, timing will be so perfect.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000
 Buddha's timing will be never going to delay.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:20.000
 In the teaching state, the tide of ocean can mix up, something.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000
 But Buddha's time, never going to mix up.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.000
 Timing or to benefit for all the sentient beings.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:33.000
 And Buddha's throwing loving kind and compassion with them, Buddha always,

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000
 every living beings who need help, who need support.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:44.000
 Therefore, always in the teaching state, when you have the ring of devotion,

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.000
 ring, like round ring, the hook of the compassion of the Buddha

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.000
 or the blessing of the Buddha will come so easily.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:57.000
 So the devotion ring, or when you open up the devotion window,

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 the sunlight of the window, that light will come inside.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.000
 So easily, beautiful, there is no delay of this.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000
 That's what really teaching say.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.000
 So that is how Buddha is continually helping.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:20.000
 And so it's called, that is what is, how long that Buddha going to help?

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:26.000
 It's for until everyone reaches enlightenment.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000
 Enlightenment. So it is continuation.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:35.000
 It's not just once in a year, twice a year, or the one century, two centuries, all that.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.000
 But it's continuing until everyone reaches enlightenment.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:45.000
 That is known as continuation, beneficial activities.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:53.000
 Then is a, sorry, then is a pervasive.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.000
 Buddha's activity is pervasive.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:02.000
 It's not something that Buddha's activity is now happening in the southern direction,

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000
 or is not going to happen in the west or the north.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000
 No, it's pervasive.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:14.000
 It's pervasive of the time, pervasive of the places.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:19.000
 There is no distance, divisions of the time and space.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:24.000
 Everywhere according to teaching, it's pervasive.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000
 All that.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.000
 And then third one is when Buddha help.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:33.000
 How that help is kind of Buddha himself.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:39.000
 Them or her, or whether them start pushing, coming back in so much effort and all that things.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.000
 No, it's spontaneously.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000
 It's spontaneously. We don't need any effort.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000
 It's easy going. Easy moving.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000
 Flowing continually.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000
 Naturally, smoothly, beautifully.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:01.000
 Shining smoothly and blended in as it needed.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.000
 So it is spontaneously moving.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:13.000
 Those are known as principal, benefit, activities of the Buddha.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 So this is what we need the Buddhas now.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:24.000
 By that, I've explained briefly about among the three dual, the Buddha, we went.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:30.000
 Again, as I said, it's not something that I'm talking new things you did not hear.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.000
 And we all heard these teachings, things.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:39.000
 So I'm replying my memory and your memories.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.000
 And maybe I'm sometimes making a mistake.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000
 You can correct me too.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.000
 It says we are replying our memories so you can correct.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.000
 We all follow the teaching of the greatest teacher,

00:31:52.000 --> 00:32:00.000
 Buddha Shakyamuni and lineage masters. So therefore, again, as I said, we are reminded to each

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:00.000
 other

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000
 and we in a way can correct each other too.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000
 And that is my brief talk this afternoon.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000
 And thank you very much everyone again for participating and coming.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000
 Thank you again. Thank you.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000
 Now we do short meditation as we begin.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000
 Thank you.
