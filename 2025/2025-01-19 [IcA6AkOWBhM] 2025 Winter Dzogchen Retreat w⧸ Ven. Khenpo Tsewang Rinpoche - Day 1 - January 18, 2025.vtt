00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.550
 Thank you very much, everyone, again for participating. Thank you for coming. Thank you very much

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:19.510
 for coming. Thank you very much, everyone. And thank you very much to all the participants on the

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:27.210
 Zoom or on the line. I'm also thankful, grateful. You're making time and effort to join us. I'm

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.000
 very grateful.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 And what we're doing, talking here, is something really important. I believe, and again, you

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.090
 believe too, I believe in the Buddha's teaching. Because when we follow the Buddha's teaching,

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.350
 meditation teacher, Buddha Chaturmani and a work member of somebody, everyone says, all the monks

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.000
 have said, in this lifetime, there are two things to do.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.260
 The purpose is that we fulfill the goal and the vision of this lifetime, and the purpose of the

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:06.570
 beautiful goals of this life, and as well as for the future, there's two things. And the most of

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:13.680
 the time, we spend time to fulfill the goal and the purpose of these life activities, and all the

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.000
 different things, which is known as formally the activity of the samsaras.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.430
 But when we follow the teaching of the Buddha and the teaching of the gracious teacher of Bhumbara

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:31.600
 and the sambhava, we're not just doing it only for this life, these times. We're doing it for this

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.000
 world too, but for the future.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.900
 And also, we're not just doing it only for ourselves, but we're doing this practice and meditating,

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:48.000
 whatever we're doing, the Buddha's teaching, is for thinking of all the things that are more broad,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 good, more broad and bigger minds.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.590
 And in the vastness mind, we're doing that. Whether we can prefer that or achieve, or whether we

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:06.820
 can keep up that all the time or not, but at least we have the intention to do something good for

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:13.000
 ourselves, to all the beings, and reach and pray that we all do.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.820
 So therefore, I think we all get together here. Whether it is Zoom, whether we're together here, of

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:27.000
 course, together here is so wonderful, so beautiful, because that makes more kind of inspiring,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 helping and supporting.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:37.590
 And also, it is more mandatory activities, you're making more joyful effort to come and to do the

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:46.190
 practices that spending time towards the Dharma and spending effort for the Dharma to benefit all

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.000
 beings is known as accumulation of merit.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 Accumulation of merit? What's the merit? I'm sure.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.800
 You heard, I heard, we all heard that in order to reach enlightenment, in order to purify our

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:06.000
 negative within obstacles, we have to accumulate merit, merit.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:15.220
 So making all the effort and spending time and energy and for the Dharma, it is known as virtuous,

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.000
 meritorious activities.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.510
 And when we read history of the Lord, teaching of the Buddha, great teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni,

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:33.280
 before he gets enlightenment, he spends so much effort, time in the college, in the commitment, for

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.000
 the practice, for the Dharma, for the teachings.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.450
 Really, he spends so much time and accumulated merit and reach enlightenment, become that. And so

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:52.290
 many great Masters also spend a lot of time and effort, the energy, and so many, put together, to

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.000
 become the great Masters.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.830
 When you read life stories from that, when Buddhism came to Tibet for the first time, so many great

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:08.570
 Masters went so really worthy of courage and commitment to join the effort and ignored or kind of

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:13.000
 don't care if the heart can, difficulty, journey of that time.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.180
 That time, journeys are not so easy. Even in the distant, close in the country, neighborhood land,

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.000
 neighborhood countries, but it's according to teaching.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.660
 And of course, we know it's all difficult and makes such a big effort and gets all the teachings

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:35.000
 and brought back to the teachings to Tibet. Those are our own teachings.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.040
 So today, we are all gathered to do such a beautiful practice and meditate and reactivate our

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:46.000
 understanding, knowledge, or reminder of our teaching practice.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 You learn. I think it's really wonderful. I'm so thankful. I'm so grateful. Thank you, everyone.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 Thank you. Thank you, everyone.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.630
 And then again, of course, we all know, and I mentioned so many times, you know, dharma is the

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.000
 completely best upon the mind, not too much external things.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.370
 So mind, in order to also resist the dharma teaching and also to contemplate the teaching, to

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:18.000
 practice the dharma, we have to correct our mind, our own mind.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:26.190
 Mind is the engine. Mind is the foundation. Mind is the everything. For that reason, again, we

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.000
 spend our beautiful motivation.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.930
 Motivation of the joy and appreciation. Motivation of the vastness. Motivation of the Mahayana

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:37.000
 teachings.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.220
 And the skillful means the motivation of the Vedayana teachings. Those are, again, our tool that,

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:47.000
 of course, many of you already know, but few of you don't know exactly.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:56.220
 And what means, fourth is motivation of joy, primo joy, more appreciation. In this lifetime, we

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.000
 have maybe many some difficulties and troubles.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.700
 But after all, if you count the percentage, we have really a lot of reason to celebrate joy and

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.000
 appreciation in many ways.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:15.340
 In the worldly level, in the spiritual level, we have lot of good. High light is joy. That is

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:23.000
 medicine. That is healing power, primo joy, more appreciation, more grateful.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:30.810
 Those are known as foundation of dharma, too, really. And also in the samsara, it is so good to

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:37.000
 have more joy, more appreciation, more grateful, more contentment.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:44.530
 All those are known as the luxuries, richness. When we don't have the joy and appreciation, content

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:49.000
ment, what we have, we are, can be poor.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:56.300
 When we have joy and appreciation, being grateful, more contentment, we are rich. Those are known

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:00.000
 as the rich wealth of dharma, spiritual.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:07.450
 It's natural. We're not making up the joy and appreciation. We have really lot of reason to be more

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:16.000
 joy, more appreciation, more thankful, more grateful, more contentment.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:24.330
 Those are the common general foundations of the teachings. When our practice is best upon that, we

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:34.000
 will go very far and very straight without any obstacles, any big chains, really.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:42.040
 Therefore, also to exhibit teaching, to activate any teaching or brain understanding, more joy,

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:46.000
 more appreciation, more grateful, and happy.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:52.110
 All that, all the situations, circumstances and opportunities, you both, each in terms of those

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:58.110
 great masters, even though in a life we had a lot of trouble, they said, we have a lot of trouble,

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:00.000
 but I'm so thankful for that trouble.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:07.030
 Because of that, I am able to connect with dharma. With all that, that trouble, I won't get

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:09.000
 connected to teaching.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:18.660
 So therefore, great master Dung Nip said, I'm thankful, great master Dung Chin Pa. I'm thankful

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:25.000
 that obstacle that met connected, I can practice dharma and I'm become now the fearlessness.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:34.350
 I reach the fearlessness because of that obstacle, because of that troubles, thankful even for the

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:37.000
 obstacles, handiness.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:43.940
 And I'm talking now, not just only that, thankful for what we have, what we have, the beautiful

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:47.000
 qualities, what we really, we reach out.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:53.450
 It's more practical, not just hovering on the sky and looking some different directions, but

00:08:53.450 --> 00:09:01.580
 starting from here, from the bottom, from the dome, from the ground, more practical, more healthy,

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:05.000
 more beautiful, more stable.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:11.840
 Therefore, bring more joy and appreciation in the life. And also having opportunity to do practice,

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:20.000
 to understand. This is the scope of teaching, the practice is very special, very special.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:27.870
 So thankful, grateful, with joy and appreciation. Now, not just only joy, then second motivation is

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:33.000
 the Mahayana motivation, known as vastness, motivation, bodhicata.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:40.810
 Thank you for all living beings, reading that. I'm interested in what that means, increasing more

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:42.000
 compassion.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 Compassion is the foundation of the Buddha teaching.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:59.980
 Buddha said to the bodhisattva, vajyapani, vajyapani, bodhisattva, vajyapani, Buddha said the vajy

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:06.000
apani is best, the root of enlightenment is compassion.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 Compassion is the root of enlightenment. And that is the foundation of the teaching.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 And vastness, motivation, motivation of Mahayana started with compassion.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:28.780
 Taking all living beings, and what that means, all living beings, not just human beings, not just

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:38.800
 only these Americans or these country beings, but all the living beings, all the animals, all the

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:41.000
 individual beings.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:51.490
 Anybody that is open, you know, beings of six realms, six different universes, six different realms

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:55.000
, or six different worlds.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:05.710
 The realm of the world of the hell-ramps, the realm of the worlds of the hungry gods, the realm of

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:13.000
 the world of all animals, the realm of the human beings.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:19.130
 And there are so many human beings on this world that we see. In this world, there are so many

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:21.000
 beings, all the beings.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:29.000
 And all the realms of the aspiras, realms and worlds of the gods, realms.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:37.910
 Why we have to feel compared to all of them? Because their intention, desire that every living

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:41.000
 being has the same intention.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:50.740
 Like to be happy, like to be joy, like to be peaceful, like to fulfill all the goals, all the

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:52.000
 wishes.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 But yet, they're not fulfilling. Everyone is struggling. Everyone has difficulty.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 To compare what so many people go, or many beings go, to with us, we are in heaven.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:17.090
 Ourself really in heaven, to compare with what trouble the difficult is going in the different

00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:18.000
 realms.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 Or not just only in the realms, even this world, even on this earth.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:35.450
 To compare with somebody else going through all the difficult challenges and troubles, one after

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:36.000
 another.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 Not just one trouble, right troubles.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:50.780
 To compare with that, we are in heaven. Those who are here, those who are in this country, majority

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:51.000
.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 Even though there's someone, even this rich country going through troubles, a lot of them.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:05.000
 So everyone's intention is the same. They like to be happy. There's no exceptions.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 Therefore, every compassion is so important, so powerful. Compassion is medicine.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
 Compassion is the root of enlightenment, really in the teaching stage.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.540
 And the root of enlightenment, and not just the root of enlightenment, the essential of the

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:25.000
 enlightenment.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:32.000
 Central column of enlightenment, feel great compassion to all the living beings, to everyone.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 And we feel compassion, what we join in Dharma, in Mahayana Buddhism.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 Poor, immeasurable jobs. May all living beings are free from suffering.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 And cause of suffering, may all living beings have happiness, cause of happiness.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:03.000
 Really wishing sincerely from the heart, and joining those prayer, "Whoa."

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
 In what the teaching says, the greatest teacher, Buddha, he comes up and says,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 "If you say that one sincerely from deep over your heart, heart and soul, and rougher like that,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 that has so much power to purify all the obscurations,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 negativities, and accumulated merits.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:30.000
 Accumulated, purified obstacles, obscurations, disease, sicknesses."

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 Compassion is healing power. It is the most powerful medicine, inner healing.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 It heals. It heals our sicknesses, our obscurations.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
 Also it helps with others, whole beings.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000
 So therefore, it's compassion. It's really vastness of compassion.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 Why isn't he called vastness? He's compassion to all living beings.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:03.000
 Everyone, without any discrimination, without any partially, and reaching ever.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 That is called reach of the bodhijapa. That is called compassion of bodhijapa.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 We all have the compassion, actually.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 Everyone, without compassion and loving kindness or love, no one can survive.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
 Whether you are a human being, whether you are animals.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000
 But everyone's compassion and love is limited.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 When bodhisattva of love, my inner love and compassion is vastness.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.000
 So no boundaries, no limitations, no discriminations.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 It's a pervasive light to shine everywhere, to every place.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 Really we're sensitive from the heart.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 That is foundation and practice of dharma, resilient dharma.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 In the teachings, when we have that compassion, that attitude,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:06.000
 that teaching and practices go deep to the heart and eluded, not become shaky.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 And start with some excitement in that and then fade away.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
 Many times that happened. He said, "Fade away." Why?

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:22.000
 Because we didn't activate our compassion and loving kindness, joy and appreciation.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 And when we're not activated, then what comes?

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000
 All those duality, consumptions, negativity.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:36.000
 In the Buddha teaching, often named obstacles, obstacles, all the emotions,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 different doubt, hesitation, skeptical.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.000
 All those comes, one after another, and they ruined us.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:50.000
 According to the teaching, these skeptical thoughts ruined our life.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000
 Not just only this lifetime, from the biggest times.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
 That's what we are wondering in samsara.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
 In the biggest time, it carried that thought.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
 It carried us every, all the time.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 That soul, the effort, the strength and courage and commitment,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
 compassion and loving kindness, is so important.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 That's called vastness, motivation of the Mahayana or the Bodhisattva.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
 And also think of ourself at this time.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
 Really practice and meditate.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000
 These riches, they really wish this benefit for all this universal world.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 Even in our own eyes, our ears, how much trouble and difficulties

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.000
 are going on these natural disasters, man-made troubles.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
 One after another, all that.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
 Really, this is our retreat, our practice.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 This whole one we made that become the big support, big antidote.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:53.000
 To ease, to remove all the obstacles, all these natural disasters

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 and bring more balance, more balance to us externally.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 More balance, inversion to our, all the human beings mentality stages,

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 all the big, really rich, sensitive from the heart and the mind

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000
 is so powerful and so special.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000
 Those are known as teaching and practicing downwards.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000
 And this one is known as the motivation of the Vedayana teachings

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
 and bring more, kind of, enlightened qualities.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 In the Vedayana teaching, everything is enlightened states.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
 Our world, why that means enlightened states?

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000
 Why that everything is enlightened?

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:39.000
 The ordinary nature, ordinary quality is all enlightened states.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
 Everything.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
 But why we don't see now?

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
 Because due to our duality, our negativities,

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000
 our obscurations are completely blocked.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:55.000
 Our duality negativity is like as cataracts or where else is blocked.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000
 So everything is a reality, enlightened states, things like this.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 And those are known as five perfect states or three Vedas states.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000
 And three Vedas, all poems are enlightened.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
 All the songs are enlightened.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000
 And all the mind and the space are enlightened.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
 Everything is enlightened.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 And that is the terminology used, "Vedya."

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000
 "Vedya" means soft world, it's oscillated into English, maybe diamonds.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000
 So they're uncheckable, unchangeable.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000
 The enlightened nature qualities, enlightened states,

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 everything is divine and beautiful states, kind of having those energies.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000
 Everything is that beautiful state,

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 have that tone or at least activated that "A,"

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000
 known as the purity, motivation of the Vedayana teachings.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000
 And then that, so with those thought,

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 and we go now with this text that whenever you have this,

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000
 this and we go here now, now here.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000
 And this is, then who taught this teaching?

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.000
 Who taught this teaching?

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000
 And this is the essence teaching,

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000
 teaching of the entire Buddha teaching,

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000
 particularly more connected with the Doki teachings.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000
 And who taught this?

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.000
 And the very famous master, and many of you met and heard,

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000
 and known as his Holiness, "Dunurumuchi,"

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 or many times we called "Jabgi Dunurumuchi,"

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000
 who came in the 20th century,

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:32.000
 and he was one of the great enlightened masters in the 20th century.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 In the 20th century, he taught so many teachings

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:40.000
 throughout the world, in Tibet, in India, in the Bhutan,

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000
 in the old Nepal, and everywhere.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000
 And he was renowned, great enlightened master,

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000
 and his teachings are now published.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000
 All that is our 45th book for all teachings.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000
 So he's one of the great, really, masters,

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000
 living master, also Tertung,

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000
 and also known as Regent of the Naripam Masambhava.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000
 He is Regent of the Naripam Masambhava.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000
 Oh, he is, he was.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.000
 And the Naripam Masambhava came in swimming home,

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000
 home as the new devotees.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000
 So he's very famous teacher,

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000
 very high in comparison to the teacher,

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.000
 and master of all the great masters in India.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000
 But yet he's so simple, so humble,

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:34.000
 so appealing, so peaceful, peaceful.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000
 This great master, so many great teachings,

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.000
 and this is one of those very essence teachings,

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.000
 particularly more direct to do the practices,

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000
 to meditate, to kind of bring all the teachings of the Buddha

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000
 to condense it and practice that.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000
 So that is what he wrote.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000
 And whenever you go to, you know,

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:05.000
 his life story or his,

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 there's so many great masters,

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 so many his disciples,

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000
 and all the teachings,

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000
 so many places.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000
 So that's it.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000
 And now, this title will go.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000
 This teaching, they always talk like this,

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000
 or the very great masters of those teachings,

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000
 when they gave the teaching, they always told this way.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000
 So I try to follow all of these kind of input steps.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000
 So this teaching, this whole teaching is divided into three groups.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000
 The first, second, and third.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 First is the title of this book.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000
 Second is the principle body of this teaching.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 And the third is, then colorful of those teachings.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000
 So those are three.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 Three.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.000
 So now we go to the title of this teaching.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000
 Title of this teaching is what is here.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000
 Here in the English translated.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000
 Essential heart and stroke of the joking,

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000
 will, meditation, and conduct.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000
 So that is the title of this teaching.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:23.000
 Title is just generally, often in the teaching, often said that teaching,

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:32.000
 the title is the condensed meaning of the entire, this teaching too.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000
 So the title is not just a title,

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:43.000
 but it has really is the essence of this whole, this booklet.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000
 So this is the title.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:52.000
 And now this is, first is that we go to the essential heart and stroke terms.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000
 Essential heart and stroke terms.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.000
 This, again, this essential heart structure,

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:06.000
 referring to this is essence teachings of the entire Buddha teachings.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000
 Buddha, a gracious teacher, Buddha Shatyamuni,

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000
 who came two thousand six hundred years ago in India,

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 he gave the teaching after he got enlightenment.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000
 Even though he is already enlightenment,

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000
 but in the external level,

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000
 he started giving the teaching after his enlightenment.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000
 According to his story,

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.000
 he reached enlightenment under Bodhi tree in the Buddha Gaya

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.000
 on the northern India at 35.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.000
 Once he got enlightenment and after putting nine days after seven weeks,

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000
 then he gave the fourth teaching,

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 which is known as the poor noble true teachings

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000
 in the Varanasi or the modern time,

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:55.000
 the designated location or that is modern time,

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.000
 Sarnam or ancient time, Dheapak.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000
 So he gave the fourth noble teaching.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.000
 From that old world, he gave the teaching.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:12.000
 The teaching, until he entered Mahaparin nirvana, Mahaparin nirvana means

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000
 until he passed away.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:20.000
 He passed away 81 or 80, according to different calendars.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.000
 They have different ways, but about 80 years when he got it.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000
 He is also Mahaparin nirvana passing away.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.000
 He announces that he will now go soon.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000
 He will live soon.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000
 And he will live soon because of where the nature is.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 Everything is really like comes, stays and goes.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000
 And now it is also his time to go.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:54.000
 And if students should not be, or the followers should not be upset,

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000
 they say this is the part of the nature, the disciplines.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000
 We should all accept that.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000
 We all are in that same state.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 So I will go to enter the Mahaparin nirvana, right places,

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000
 where I like to go.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:17.000
 And he walked, and also that, he walked with the students with bare feet,

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 together with the group, and when they reach to the kharastha,

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000
 not for the kharastha, kushina, there is a famous place,

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:31.000
 known as, in India, that is also pilgrimage support.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:37.000
 And when he reached the kushina, and then he was called to Anand,

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000
 which is who is the attendance of the Shakyamuni.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 For many years, also his cousin too.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:50.000
 He told, Anand, this is the place, now I am going to enter.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:55.000
 And turn the Mahaparin nirvana, and also I am not going to walk.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.000
 I am not going to walk now, not to park.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.000
 This is the place, and there is two famous, I mean not famous,

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000
 two trees, called the salad trees.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000
 When they told him, they said, these are tick trees, tick trees,

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:14.000
 but he is sunken, because salad trees breed with two trees.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:20.000
 He said, Anand, please hold my wood off.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000
 Hold it four times, put it on the ground.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000
 So, Anand followed exactly same instruction,

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.000
 and then, Buddha sat down there, sat down there,

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000
 and he entered Mahaparin nirvana there.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000
 But that is just, I am talking that.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:41.000
 But however, he gave the teachings for over 45 years.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:46.000
 All those teachings are best on the three different levels of teachings.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000
 Those are known as the pranajan teachings,

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.000
 Mahayana teachings, or that in the Vedayana teachings,

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000
 all those teachings is.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:02.000
 So, this is essential of all the teachings.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000
 Teachings, how to do practice.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.000
 Put that practice to both simple ways.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:14.000
 Not kind of going all the different academic or all the different teachings,

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:19.000
 but to put it into practice in simple ways.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:25.000
 So, that is what is essential, essence.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:30.000
 Instructions, essence, and heart instructions.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:38.000
 Because this practice, again, is the essential heart practice, as I said.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:43.000
 See, the Buddha's teachings give those all different levels, different teachings.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:49.000
 In the Vedayana teachings, that teachings are also divided as like two different groups.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:54.000
 And those are known as the out-at-at teachings, in-at-at-at teachings.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.000
 So, two different levels of teachings.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.000
 Among that two groups of teachings,

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 in-at-at-at-at is divided by Maha Yoga, Anu Yoga, and Ati Yogas.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.000
 And of course, many of you know that, those teachings.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:17.000
 So, Maha Yoga explaining this, because this is now Tantra teachings, the S-treat teachings.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:22.000
 In Maha Yoga explaining that all these universes,

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:29.000
 principally all these universe elements, all are enlightened.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:34.000
 Everything is enlightened, as I said earlier, all enlightened.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.000
 So, that means all the forms are enlightened.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.000
 And how many forms there?

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000
 We divided the forms.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000
 Five different forms.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.000
 Maybe, maybe, maybe, AC.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.000
 I think so.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.000
 Maybe put, maybe, put, maybe, put the AC.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 AC, if anybody likes you.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.000
 It's hot.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000
 Yeah, yeah, I was...

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.000
 For me, it's okay, I think.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:10.000
 So, the Maha Yoga is...

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:17.000
 Maha Yoga is tantrable, means great observing meditation.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.000
 Great... that I'm not ready.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.000
 Great observing meditation or concentration.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:31.000
 And that teaching explaining all the forms are enlightened.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000
 The forms are what?

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000
 Five aggregates are enlightened.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000
 All good.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000
 Five aggregates are what?

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:46.000
 Of course, many of you know already, but I'm just a few of you don't know.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.000
 Five aggregates.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000
 Poem aggregates.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.000
 And then, feeling aggregates.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:59.000
 And then, third one is, perception aggregates.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:04.000
 And the conception aggregates.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000
 And the consciousness aggregates.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000
 So, these are called, five aggregates.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.000
 And the five aggregates, the Poem aggregates,

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:22.000
 also that included all this external wall, mountain, river, and earth.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:27.000
 Everything, tree, everything is within the Poem aggregates.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000
 There, enlightened.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000
 And then, feeling aggregates.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:36.000
 That is then now more connected with our own individual mind,

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000
 or individual, our self, or the beings connected.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.000
 Those are four different aggregates, I already said, all enlightened.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:51.000
 So, that is the Maha Yoga teaching, essence of Maha Yoga.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:59.000
 And then, Anu Yoga teaching explains, as Anu Yoga means the observing stage,

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:06.000
 the following, similarly with Maha Yoga or Adi Yoga.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.000
 So, it's called Anu Yoga teaching.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:15.000
 Anu Yoga teaching is explaining all our physical,

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:23.000
 this our, particularly our body is the medulla, is divine, pure land.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000
 This our forms are enlightened.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:31.000
 This universal world is enlightened externally, said,

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:35.000
 but this body is also enlightened.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.000
 And this body has, is the miniature,

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:44.000
 or the body is the miniature, or the duplicate of this world,

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 what we see outside.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.000
 World, outside what we see.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:57.000
 See, stars, sun, and moon, space, mountains, trees,

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:02.000
 and the water, rivers, waters, trees, grass, earth.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:07.000
 All that you see, externally, today.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:13.000
 This body has, according to Valiana teaching, or the Anu Yoga teaching,

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000
 it has all same things.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.000
 It's the miniature.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.000
 And even Anu Yoga teaching said,

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.000
 body is the, it's not weak thing now, it's kind of,

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.000
 I'm saying now, it's miniature.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:30.000
 But reality, world is the duplicate of our body.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.000
 Not the body is the duplicate of the world.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:39.000
 World is the duplicate of the body, explaining all that.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000
 So, it's already enlightened.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000
 Everything is enlightened state.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:48.000
 To activate that teaching and practice, realization,

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000
 that is known as, then, Anu Yoga teaching.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:57.000
 Then, Ati Yoga teaching, supreme observing, I'm talking about it.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.000
 Yoga, I'm talking about it as observing.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000
 Yoga, this time.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000
 But generally, what it means is yoga.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000
 Yoga means natural.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.000
 Yoga is natural, where the natural is.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000
 They say, simply natural.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000
 Natural is, yoga is natural.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000
 But I'm talking, observing around.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:24.000
 Why use observing that, and all coming back to the natural status.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:27.000
 We are carried by the force externally then,

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.000
 but now we are coming back to the way the natural is,

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.000
 or the to the observing as it is.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:40.000
 So, supreme observing state, supreme natural state, Ati Yoga.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000
 That, and so.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000
 So, this, among, so all that,

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:50.000
 this Dokchin is really the essence of all the teachings.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000
 What means Ati Yoga?

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.000
 Ati Yoga, supreme observing teaching.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:00.000
 Ati Yoga, discovery, even everything,

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000
 all the Mahayoga explain all the enlightened,

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:08.000
 and all the Anayoga explain all the physical forms are enlightened.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:13.000
 But Ati Yoga explain all that form,

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.000
 and all this universe are enlightened,

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.000
 because mind is enlightened.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:28.000
 Nature of our mind, each of our mind is really enlightened.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.000
 This enlightenment is not just enlightened recently.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:36.000
 Mind is all the nature of our mind,

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.000
 is already enlightened, originally.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:45.000
 Therefore, the physical forms are enlightened

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.000
 because it is the split of the mind.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000
 And the universe is enlightened

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000
 because it is the split of the pure nature of the mind,

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.000
 or nature of the mind, enlightened.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.000
 And so, this next mind is originally enlightened.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:09.000
 And this teaching, this is explaining,

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.000
 or is going to that direction,

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:17.000
 to discovering the origin and enlighten the mind.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:22.000
 Discovering is the origin and enlightenment.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.000
 And so, that is, is, is.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:30.000
 And then, instructions explaining this,

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.000
 of course, he is going to be his teachings, instructions.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.000
 But he is also referring, this is not just,

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.000
 he made up that teaching.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000
 Because he follow in the instructions of the gracious teacher,

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000
 Buddha Shakyamuni, and all the linear master,

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.000
 the guru-bhema sambhama, and all, from the guru-bhema sambhama,

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000
 all the linear master, one after another, continually,

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000
 that until he, him, or he, is the teaching,

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:05.000
 so he is the brain, the instructions of all the teachings,

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:10.000
 of the past masters, practitioner, brain, target.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:15.000
 And this is also known as a new master, order transmissions,

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:19.000
 order linear, order transmission, order instructions.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:24.000
 It is continued, not just created by one individual.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:28.000
 It is uninterrupted, order instruction,

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:34.000
 linear, that comes from the Buddha,

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.000
 and as well as all the linear masters.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:42.000
 And so, this is, in a way, and again, if I go kind of a little more,

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.000
 let's try a little detail.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.000
 In the Nyingma school, or in the Vadiyana teaching,

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.000
 often mentioned, there is three lineages,

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.000
 mind-to-mind transmission lineage,

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.000
 and symbolic transmission lineage,

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000
 and order transmission lineage.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:07.000
 Wherever translated, mind-to-mind transferring systems,

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:13.000
 and then symbolic sign in the signal,

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.000
 through a sign in a single, last meeting of the teachings,

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:23.000
 and then order instruction, last meeting of the teachings.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:29.000
 So, this is congruence of all that three lineages,

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.000
 three lineages, come from one single state,

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.000
 as order instruction or instructions.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:41.000
 And so therefore, it is explained and indicated,

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:46.000
 this teaching is not just created by someone,

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.000
 or created by his whole union himself,

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.000
 but is a continuing order instruction lineage.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000
 And what is that lineage?

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:01.000
 The Quora teaching opens in lineage of the Buddha teaching,

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.000
 a very simple interesting,

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.000
 lineage of love, lineage of compassion,

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000
 lineage of the Muslims.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.000
 So, this is the union,

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:16.000
 or it is inseparably together,

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.000
 lineage of love, lineage of compassion,

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000
 lineage of wisdom,

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.000
 that came in the form of the instruction,

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:34.000
 that is then transmitted to all of us by his whole union.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.000
 Then in here, say that Dzogchen,

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.000
 now many of you know already this, Dzogchen word.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.000
 But Dzogchen is, we say that,

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000
 where is all instruction?

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.000
 All teaching comes from Dzogchen.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:54.000
 Dzogchen is available, which means greater completions.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.000
 And the greater completion, where that refer again,

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:01.000
 is the same thing to our own nature of the mind,

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.000
 our own awareness.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:09.000
 Your awareness, my awareness, that is everything.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.000
 What is really Dzogchen?

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.000
 Dzogchen is our awareness.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:17.000
 Your awareness, my awareness.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.000
 Awareness, or my nature of the mind,

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.000
 your nature of the mind is Dzogchen.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.000
 What Dzogchen means, to be the word,

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:26.000
 what does that mean?

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.000
 Greater completions, or greater source?

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.000
 Greater source, greater completions.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000
 Completions.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.000
 And then it goes, if we go a little more,

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.000
 in the teaching of Dzogchen,

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.000
 say that the foundation Dzogchen,

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.000
 and the path Dzogchen,

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:51.000
 and the achievement Dzogchen for greater,

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000
 yeah, result Dzogchen.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000
 Those are the teaching measures.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:01.000
 So three, yeah, three, three.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:06.000
 So the ground Dzogchen is our own awareness.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:12.000
 Your awareness, I said already, my awareness.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.000
 And Dzogchen is the greater completions,

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.000
 or the greater source.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.000
 Why I'm saying the greater source?

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000
 Because according to the teaching,

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:29.000
 Dzogchen is source of samsara and nirvana.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:36.000
 Both come from one's own awareness.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.000
 And maybe it's difficult, hard to believe,

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.000
 mind is the source of samsara,

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.000
 mind is the source of nirvana.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:50.000
 Our own awareness, our own nature of the mind,

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.000
 nature of the mind, your mind.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.000
 So that means my nature of the mind,

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:59.000
 or my mind is the source of my samsara

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:03.000
 and source of my nirvana.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:08.000
 So it's coming from that.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:13.000
 And also where is samsara and nirvana?

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:16.000
 It's the nature of the mind.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.000
 If it comes, if it says all the samsara

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000
 and all the nirvana,

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:27.000
 I say one way it's included within the mind,

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:32.000
 within the nature of the mind.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:39.000
 And so everything really is included within the mind.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:46.000
 Everything, where our samsara is,

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:49.000
 in what way is our nirvana,

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:54.000
 as I said many times, in the mind.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:57.000
 Where it comes from is the mind.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.000
 So expanding from the mind

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:03.000
 and also observing to the mind.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:08.000
 Mind and mind encompass everything.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:12.000
 In the teachings, according to the Buddha's teachings,

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.000
 the greatest teachings, the Buddha's teachings,

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:18.000
 how mind is big.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.000
 How big mind is.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:25.000
 Mind has no measurement.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:30.000
 And what, you know, in the teachings it,

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.000
 students ask to Buddha,

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:37.000
 what is limitation of the mind?

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:42.000
 And the Buddha asks, what is limitation of the space?

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:46.000
 And then the Buddha, the student says,

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:49.000
 there is no limitation of the space.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:54.000
 And similarly, Buddha said, mind has no limitation.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:44:00.000
 As far as space goes, that far mind goes.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:03.000
 So that means mind is pervasive,

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.000
 this place is pervasive.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:08.000
 There is not really any discipline.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.000
 I mean, limitation is pointless.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000
 That is the dzogchen.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.000
 Dzogchen.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:18.000
 So everything, all the enlightenment,

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:26.000
 pada ho, nirvana, samsara, all is within the mind,

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.000
 within the awareness state of the mind.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:34.000
 That is what dzogchen is.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:37.000
 Now, dzogchen is the teaching of this,

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:41.000
 so that is really, and then also in the teaching of cremation,

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.000
 I become many of you all know this,

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.000
 all the accumulation merit,

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.000
 Muslims are also completely within the dzogchen.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:52.000
 When you discover the nature of the mind or the rupa,

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:55.000
 we discover and we accumulate the merit,

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.000
 and we accumulate both merit.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.000
 What is the merit?

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:00.000
 The accumulation merit.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:05.000
 So that is the really meaning of the dzogchen.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:10.000
 Now we talk the woo and the meditation and the conduct.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:14.000
 And this is what we are going to practice now,

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.000
 how we will go to practices,

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:20.000
 how we are going to practice dzogchen through these three.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:25.000
 Post the woo, then meditation, and then conduct.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:37.000
 So, this is the two, or three, sorry, three, woo and meditation and conduct.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:45.000
 Now, woo, generally of course, this woo means what you are going to look,

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:51.000
 what you are going to behold, what you are going to, what you, woo is like foundations.

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:55.000
 Foundation, what are we going to practice?

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000
 Or what are we going to meditate?

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:01.000
 We are going to meditate on the woo.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:04.000
 And with the assistance of the conduct.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.000
 So, woo, meditation and conduct.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:12.000
 So now, the woo, we are talking, we are talking,

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:17.000
 woo, if I explain the woo, what we have used is terminology.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:21.000
 Woo is also like philosophy.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:27.000
 Woo is also your ideas, your understanding of this.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:32.000
 And now, all this of course, we are not talking externally, present time.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.000
 We are talking to more involved in that.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:42.000
 So, this time, woo is more connected with our repa.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:48.000
 Woo is the repa or we are wooing the nature of the mind.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.000
 That is what we are wooing.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.000
 And generally of course, woo is this time.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:47:01.000
 In the Buddhism, woo is what we call discovering the nature, exactly as it is.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.000
 That is what we are really looking for.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:08.000
 We are not going to be thinking of something that is not natural.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:13.000
 We are looking to the nature of exactly what it is.

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:16.000
 And then there are different schools in Buddhism.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.000
 And there was a different school, for example,

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:27.000
 in the Puerto Rican Buddhist school explaining of the woo is that egoless in the state.

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:34.000
 That means their meditation is more egoless in the state to discover the egoness.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:42.000
 Because the ego is, the ego or the eye is nominated by the mind,

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:49.000
 but in reality there is no really independent existing eye on the ego.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:48:00.000
 So, discovering that through the logic and looking, observing where is ego or eye.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.000
 Everything is existing, looking to our body.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:11.000
 And we did not find then meditating on the egoless in the state.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:17.000
 And then in the Mahayana teaching, then meditating of the great emptiness.

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.000
 And that is also natural.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:24.000
 There is no egos of the individual.

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:28.000
 There is no egos, same as foundation schools of Buddhism.

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:35.000
 But same time, also all the phenomena existing, there is no solid existing things.

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:43.000
 Solid existing. Everything is, is translucent, is emptiness.

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:50.000
 So, everything has a emptiness and prefer any aspect.

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:53.000
 Totally great emptiness states.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:57.000
 And meditating on that status, those are known as woo.

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:07.000
 Now the rotating is going to the bull's eye on the nature of the, exactly to the source of that.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:12.000
 Not going to the externally, but going to the mind.

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:17.000
 And where is the mind? Mind.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:22.000
 And there is again, even though we call, we have the mind, our mind,

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:29.000
 but when you look the mind, there is nothing existing that we can find.

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:33.000
 And therefore, it is called, emptiness mind.

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:37.000
 There is really nothing in solid existence.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:46.000
 So that finding of the no mind is the woo of the Dzogchen.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:51.000
 And of course, there is more explaining later, explaining that.

00:49:51.000 --> 00:50:02.000
 But when we look to our own mind, when we didn't find any solid existing, anything,

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:09.000
 then we discover the nature of the mind, or as it is.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:17.000
 So that is, is the woo, that is the discovery of us.

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:26.000
 And when we discover that, then meditation means continually maintaining,

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:30.000
 keeping that within, within.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:37.000
 Then of course, within instructions, instructions, you are keeping that meditation.

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:45.000
 So that means, what we are meditating, we are maintaining the woo,

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:51.000
 what we behold, what we discover, you are maintaining that.

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:55.000
 Why we need maintaining that?

00:50:55.000 --> 00:51:07.000
 Because if we don't maintain that woo, then we are completely interrupted by the dualities,

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:15.000
 interrupted by the emotions. And these emotions are, what are those?

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:20.000
 It is a display of the mind.

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:28.000
 So emotions are also, if you think carefully, fully, there is no existing emotions.

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:35.000
 First in time, most of us, we are grasping, clinging on the emotions.

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:43.000
 Then emotions become very powerful, very strong, and very distributed.

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:50.000
 But if we look and discover the emotion, the nature of the emotions,

00:51:50.000 --> 00:52:00.000
 and let it be as it is, then emotions are not going to disturb.

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:08.000
 Emotion is the display. So therefore, maintaining is important.

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:15.000
 Maintaining is meditation. Meditation means keeping up,

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:22.000
 keeping up the what you wooed. Then of course, there is many different meditation,

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:26.000
 or different technique, I mean, what are those techniques?

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:34.000
 We've said two. Two, meditation is samatha meditation, and vivashana meditation.

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:44.000
 So samatha meditation is supporting to maintain the woo.

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:50.000
 Because our meditation, mind is very unstable.

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:57.000
 Unstable is carried by the force of the emotions or the conceptions,

00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:02.000
 one after another. It is carried there, so we can maintain.

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:08.000
 Even we recognize the exact nature of the mind intellectually,

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:14.000
 but our realization and understanding is not strong.

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:22.000
 Therefore, easily disturbed by the arising code or the consumption.

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:29.000
 For that reason, then samatha meditation is important.

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:35.000
 And those we can talk later, but that is the meditation.

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:42.000
 Meditation maintains the woo, the woo of the rumpa.

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:47.000
 And again, that. And the next one is the conduct.

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:53.000
 Conduct is what? Generally, there are two conductors.

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:58.000
 Conduct of the well, we are not meditating or practicing,

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:04.000
 and the conduct of the well, we are meditating and practicing.

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:11.000
 So I have divided into two, two conductors.

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:14.000
 During the meditation or the practices,

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:20.000
 during the forced meditation or the non-practicing meditation,

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:26.000
 during the meditation, conduct is remembering the instructions,

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:33.000
 applying the instructions of the dispatch as the lineage instructions.

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:36.000
 That I said the lineage instructions come from Buddha

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:39.000
 to all the way to Virabha Masambhava,

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:45.000
 and then Virabha Masambhava and all the master to his donut.

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:53.000
 So that instruction is uninterrupted the instruction

00:54:53.000 --> 00:55:00.000
 of the rupa syndrome and the completion and loving kindness.

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:06.000
 And love and completion and the wisdom combined and targeted,

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:10.000
 it is spiritual, nugget instruction

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:13.000
 which should apply during the meditation.

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:18.000
 And that instruction, not forget that, forget that.

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:23.000
 During the meditation, always remember that.

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:25.000
 And the beginning of the meditation,

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:28.000
 during the meditation and after the meditation,

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.000
 remember those constructors.

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:32.000
 Also in the teaching,

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:36.000
 when you remember the instruction during the meditation,

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:39.000
 you just do as you need it.

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:41.000
 You don't have to remember.

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:51.000
 Once you are on the beautiful stages of the smooth meditation stages,

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:55.000
 then you don't have to apply the instruction of that.

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.000
 Or really you remember.

00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:01.000
 Those remembrance are called distant memories.

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:04.000
 Kind of distantly watching by the memory.

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:07.000
 Mindfulness is watching your meditation,

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:12.000
 not instantly applying those again and again with that.

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:15.000
 And then if we apply too many of that instruction,

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:18.000
 then it becomes kind of very disturbing.

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:25.000
 So therefore, I would distantly, mindfulness is watching our meditation,

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:31.000
 meditation, but continually keep the smoothness and calmness

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:37.000
 and continuation on the one we know in that stage.

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:38.000
 Just remember.

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:41.000
 And that is also a story that we remember.

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:48.000
 In Buddha Shakyamuni's time, there is a very famous arghada,

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:54.000
 known as (?) and he has become very good at arghadas.

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:57.000
 And he received the instruction.

00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:02.000
 He was a very wealthy family or wealthy son,

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.000
 a very wealthy son.

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:08.000
 And then he becomes a Buddha student and he is practicing.

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:10.000
 And he is practicing meditating there.

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:13.000
 And then he came to the Buddha.

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:17.000
 Buddha and he told, "How is your meditation?"

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:20.000
 And he said, "My meditation is not coming so good."

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:21.000
 Good.

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:29.000
 So then the Buddha said, "Why is not coming not good?"

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:33.000
 And he mentioned what he experienced and what he is going through.

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:36.000
 And Buddha said, "What are your expert?"

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:38.000
 "Well, you are in a house."

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:39.000
 "When are you in a house?"

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:41.000
 "What are you expert?"

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:42.000
 "What do you do?"

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:47.000
 He said, "I am very expert of playing the guitar or the medallins."

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:48.000
 "Medallins."

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.000
 So then Buddha asked him,

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:56.000
 "That medallion sound or the guitar sound or the guitar, how it comes?"

00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:59.000
 "By the two, my string is too tight."

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:02.000
 "Tight or string is too loose."

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:03.000
 Loose.

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:06.000
 And he said, "No, none of those who come there."

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:11.000
 "The medallins, the strings need to be perfect."

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:16.000
 He said, "Not too tight, not too loose."

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:21.000
 And so that's what this student applied to Buddha.

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:25.000
 And the Buddha said, "Medallins could do exactly that."

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:27.000
 "You could do medallins."

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:30.000
 "Not too tight, not too loose."

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:34.000
 "Too tight and can't apply all the instructions."

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:36.000
 "Too forcefully, no."

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:40.000
 "And also not, remember the instructions, also not."

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:42.000
 "So we are motivated to come here."

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:46.000
 "Very gentle, peaceful way to instruct and apply."

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:50.000
 "And then you, that's what the Buddha mentioned."

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:53.000
 "And then he did that way and he agreed to the Arathas.

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:59.000
 So therefore, the conductor is, during the meditation, again,

00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:04.000
 apply the remembered instruction, but also not constantly applying,

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:09.000
 but maintain the calmness, smoothness of the meditations.

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:17.000
 And then the post-meditation or the conduct of the well you are not meditating is,

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:21.000
 then, is called phase three conduct.

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:27.000
 Those are known as, they were great master, or great teacher, great master,

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:30.000
 Guru Pia Masambha said in his teacher.

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:37.000
 Accidental conduct, inward conduct, sacred conduct.

00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:40.000
 Those are three conduct.

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:48.000
 Accidental conduct is the physical conduct.

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:52.000
 Physical conduct, external conduct is, then,

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:58.000
 followed according to the Pundeghya teaching of the Buddha.

00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
 Buddha's teaching.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.000
 That Pundeghya teaching of the Buddha's conduct is

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:07.000
 completely based upon the mindfulness,

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:12.000
 and the alertness and the cautiousness, cautiousness.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:18.000
 But that conduct is conduct of the body, conduct of speech.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:26.000
 So, good hour conduct, activity, really mind,

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:30.000
 activity of the body, activity of speech,

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:36.000
 God with mindfulness, alertness, and cautiousness.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:41.000
 Always pause, always remember.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
 And even in the Gokye teaching,

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:51.000
 conduct should be timidhi, timidhi, t-i-m-i-dhi.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:56.000
 Conduct should be timidhi, and conduct should be,

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:05.000
 be thoughtful and mindfulness, the physical conduct.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:10.000
 And that means your own conduct will become very beautiful,

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:16.000
 calm, peaceful, soothing, calming, thoughtful,

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.000
 appealing, and not too many reactions.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
 Too many conduct, bumpy.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:29.000
 So, the outer conduct is like Pundeghya teaching of the Buddha.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:34.000
 In a conduct, as great mass of Gokye and Masambha said,

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:43.000
 hall of the sutras, so that means inner conduct, hall of the Mahayana.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
 What does that mean?

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:52.000
 Mahayana is conduct, inner conduct is conduct of the mind,

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:57.000
 conduct of the mind or the Mahayana and the body together.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:01.000
 More compassion, more loving kindness,

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:08.000
 more respect, more appreciation, more thankful.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:15.000
 That nobody sees externally, but inwardly they have more joy,

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:22.000
 more appreciation, more love, more compassion, more respect.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:26.000
 And then that will also reflect into the physically, verbally,

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:32.000
 becoming more gentle, peaceful, but inwardly.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:40.000
 Mental conduct is the bodhicata conduct, all sitting in inner conduct.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:45.000
 The physical conduct is Vaidyana conduct.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:49.000
 Vaidyana conduct is a fearlessness, not to doubt,

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:54.000
 not hesitating, hesitating, not to narrow mind.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:00.000
 All, what's called vastness, motivation, vastness, or the purest motivation.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:04.000
 See, every day is an enlightened status.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:07.000
 This is not just making up that.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:10.000
 All the forms are enlightened.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.000
 All the songs are enlightened.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:18.000
 Songs, all the space of mind is enlightened.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:23.000
 And embracing that nature by the many instructions of the teachings,

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:30.000
 which is such as known as visualizations, complete stage practices.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:36.000
 And that complete stage, the visualization stage is not two different directions.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:43.000
 The union, union of the two stages, correction stage, visualization stage,

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:50.000
 union of it, seeing everything, bring more purity, more divine qualities

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:59.000
 in the heart of mind, not net caring and the deluded, or arrested by the duality mind.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:03.000
 Vaidyana is the practice of the breath and dualities.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:10.000
 So inwardly, or secretly, have that feellessness status.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:15.000
 Even if you have the highest realization of the Vaidyana teaching,

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:20.000
 every day is a divine status, every day is a purity status.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:27.000
 And as eternal, all are exactly the same as political teachings.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:38.000
 With thoughtful, with mindfulness, with cautiousness and alertness, with terminus.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:44.000
 And all those, such as, in this life, this life, such as great masters,

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
 we saw, he's on the duality.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
 He's on the single, general.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
 He's on the Dalai Lama.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
 Now, now we see.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.000
 They are really according to Vaidyana.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
 They are highest in realization.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:08.000
 But yet, they are humble and simple, and follow the exactly external guidelines

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:12.000
 of the Buddhas as fundamental teachings.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:23.000
 And then inwardly, singularly, a human control, bodhijana, mahayana control,

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
 love and compassion.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:29.000
 That we say simply is bodhijana.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:33.000
 Now, even you have the highest, even your highest realization,

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:40.000
 realization is divine, mandala, polka, everything you see as a Buddha.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:43.000
 And everything is enlightened, all, everything.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:50.000
 But your love and compassion, completely, saturated,

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:53.000
 and filled heart with love and compassion, everything.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
 That is our goal.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:58.000
 It's surely when you're corner teaching, when you've got the highest,

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:02.000
 as much as your, you've got the realization of the true nature,

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:09.000
 the score or the rupa, nature of the mind, that much, the love, that much compassion,

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:12.000
 that much, much love is really growing.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:16.000
 In the Buddha teaching, those who are highly enlightened,

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:23.000
 their love and compassion comes as their realization, highest.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:28.000
 There's no one has highest realization, and no love, no compassion.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
 That's never happening.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:38.000
 If that's not happening, then their realization is questionable,

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
 not right.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.000
 Therefore, love and compassion, as you've seen the teaching said,

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:50.000
 as much as you've got the realization of the emptiness or realization

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:56.000
 of the true nature of the mind, that much love and compassion comes,

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
 just so strong.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:04.000
 That's why all those great masters, so compassionate, so kind,

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:10.000
 so really, so like just humble and simple.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
 Also, I'm teaching, too.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
 So that is the conduct.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:19.000
 Conduct that, so that woo, meditation, and conduct.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:27.000
 So this teaching is explaining of all that we go through,

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
 one after another, another.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:33.000
 And so that is really about the title, title of that,

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:37.000
 and now we go to start with the instructions.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:43.000
 And now here, all faithful nuns listening here,

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:49.000
 and this is the accursed by two students, two nuns,

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:53.000
 nuns and their names at the end of this.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:56.000
 This is the one with the names of the [inaudible]

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:59.000
 and the other's name is [inaudible]

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:04.000
 and three of them, three disciples of the [inaudible]

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:09.000
 asked them, asking him to give simple instructions

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:14.000
 so that they can handle, they can follow.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:18.000
 So they insisted that they hold the teaching here.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:23.000
 There, then therefore, his owners gave these instructions.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:26.000
 These instructions, and also, as I said,

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.000
 his instructions of the oral instructions,

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.000
 all the great masters, but also his instructions

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:36.000
 of subcontinent the song of, subcontinent the song

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
 of the instructions.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
 He told us that [inaudible]

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.000
 trying to think of these and trying to compose

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.000
 a really effort there.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:49.000
 But as it came, he was the mind and complete the mind,

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.000
 and then he uttered or he didn't know.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:59.000
 So this is the regular hum of his own [inaudible]

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:02.000
 as his express of his realization,

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:06.000
 his understanding, as he did and he achieved,

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:09.000
 that he is sharing to the others today.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:12.000
 And now, on the [inaudible]

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.000
 and the listening to it.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:37.000
 [inaudible]

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
 And what that actually means,

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:43.000
 because to retreat, why is it amazing?

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
 Why is it wonderful?

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.000
 There's many reasons that.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
 And that this is also, of course,

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:53.000
 expressed to himself, to his own [inaudible]

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:57.000
 himself, but it's more expressed to the others,

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.000
 to students, to nuns, nuns.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.000
 And how amazing.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:05.000
 That means how amazing you are,

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:08.000
 you have the fortunate or beautiful human beings.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:11.000
 You are born as a beautiful human being,

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
 and not just a human being,

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:17.000
 but you are determined to do practices, meditate.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:20.000
 So external vessel of the physical form

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:24.000
 is awesome or some of beautiful.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.000
 And any attitude of your thought

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:31.000
 is that willing to practice or practicing is amazing.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:35.000
 So externally is amazing, inwardly is amazing.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.000
 That is.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.000
 And that also indicated to all of us, too.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:42.000
 Which, I mean, he's honest, is it?

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:46.000
 He's asking, how awesome are we all?

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:49.000
 You are, and me too, we all.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:52.000
 And we use this amazing situation,

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
 we will get even more amazing.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
 More beautiful.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.000
 How amazing.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.000
 Painful.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:10:59.000
 More grateful.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.000
 More happy.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.000
 Happy.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:02.000
 Yes.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:06.000
 This is to be kind of as a born as human beings.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:09.000
 Where we are born as human beings,

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
 we have the interesting or the motivation

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:14.000
 to do something better for ourselves,

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
 to the other beings.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
 This is even more amazing.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
 That means without.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:23.000
 And also same time have strong courage

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
 and commitment in the heart and mind

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
 that I'm going to continue meditate.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:32.000
 I'm not let it go and hold part or drop the weight.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:36.000
 I'm going to continue going to keep this really strong.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
 Until I reach enlightenment,

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:41.000
 until I become Buddhahood,

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:46.000
 until every living beings reach enlightenment,

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
 as a great master,

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:52.000
 Master Chantideva and also Buddha Chijin said that.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:56.000
 As long as space exists,

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.000
 as long as a sentient beings exist,

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:04.000
 that long may I exist things or may I be,

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:07.000
 be and help to everyone.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:08.000
 May that become.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:12.000
 Those are the praise of the Bodhisattvas.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
 This is not just a making up,

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.000
 just saying that all short time.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
 But that is their determinations,

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:22.000
 their courage, their commitment.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:26.000
 That is not just a few years short or one,

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:29.000
 three years short, four years short of that.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
 Until I reach enlightenment,

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:34.000
 until every living being,

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:38.000
 may I be continually serviced with everyone.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
 Really you say no.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
 You need this great guide,

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:46.000
 Bodhisattva, guide to the way in the life of the Bodhisattvas.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:50.000
 Chijin said this is the Bodhisattvas.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:53.000
 And that's what called our locutus for it.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:54.000
 Here it is.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
 Even according to Chijin,

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
 he is totally enlightenment,

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:01.000
 or he or she is totally enlightenment,

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:07.000
 but yet he is acting as Bodhisattvas,

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:10.000
 helping to all the sentient beings.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:16.000
 Never I is blinking or lost,

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:21.000
 or what's called never blink or never stop the eye of compassion

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:25.000
 to even short moments or once,

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:29.000
 one second to looking for all the beings.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.000
 Therefore called in itself,

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
 in the Tibetan genesis,

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
 all the time watching,

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:37.000
 looking by compassion, compassion.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:41.000
 So therefore, this is amazing.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.000
 We are starting.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
 Now we are beginning.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:47.000
 Really, we are making that beautiful journey,

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:50.000
 journey of this great Bodhisattvas.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:51.000
 Great.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:57.000
 And the Bodhisattva journey is called journey from the joy to the joy,

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:00.000
 from the light to the light.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
 Maybe we've been from different times,

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:05.000
 from the dark to dark or dark to light.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:08.000
 The dark to the light kind of rotates in different ways.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
 But now we are going to.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:14.000
 Our journey will be from light to light and to light,

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
 brighter, brighter,

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
 and not just a bright ourselves,

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
 but going to benefit for all beings.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:23.000
 Those are therefore this is a whole,

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:27.000
 amazing situation, all of us.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.000
 And then he said,

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:32.000
 path of a numb, listen, is.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:37.000
 Path is, of course, you all know, in individuals.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:41.000
 Deva, deva, deva.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:44.000
 Not path is so important.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:47.000
 In what the great master,

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:52.000
 Nagarjuna said.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
 Why are you practicing?

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:57.000
 Because of the path.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
 Why are you practicing?

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:02.000
 Because of your path.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
 Why are you seeing that?

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:07.000
 Why are you beholding nature?

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:10.000
 Nature, nature, nature,

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:15.000
 nature of truth because of wisdom.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
 Because of wisdom.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
 Why are you practicing Dharma?

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
 Because of your path?

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:25.000
 Why are you seeing the nature of the mind?

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:26.000
 Because of wisdom.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
 Wisdom.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
 Which is more important?

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:33.000
 Again, Nagarjuna is more important.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:36.000
 Wisdom is important, he said.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:39.000
 But among these two,

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
 among these two,

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:45.000
 because this path is important,

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
 then the wisdom.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:52.000
 Because the path will connect us to the Dharma.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:55.000
 Path.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
 That's what he started.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
 Because of why you practice it,

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:00.000
 because you're a path.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
 Because of why you see the nature of the mind,

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.000
 because of your wisdom.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
 These both are important.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
 But among that, which is,

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
 wisdom is more important.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
 But before the wisdom,

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:17.000
 path is more important, you see.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
 Path is important.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
 So, therefore,

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:24.000
 path is so important.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:28.000
 That path is also translated into this.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:32.000
 Devotions. Devotions is so important.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:35.000
 In Buddhism, there is three different devotions.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:38.000
 Or that's how Buddha liked it.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:41.000
 Beginning devotions,

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:44.000
 and the desirable devotions,

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:48.000
 or unshakable devotions.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
 Unshakable devotions.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:53.000
 All the devotions can be translated,

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:56.000
 or you can use it as path.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:02.000
 And beginning is in a teaching mechanism.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:06.000
 A mission that...

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:11.000
 clarity...

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
 I've talked about it in this way.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
 I'm sure you know maybe that.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
 But clarity is devotion in the post.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:22.000
 Second is desirable devotion, or the path.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:25.000
 I'm sorry.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:28.000
 Third is, then,

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:32.000
 unshakable devotions, or the path.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:35.000
 What does that mean, actually?

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:39.000
 Desirable devotion, or the clarity devotion.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
 But when you, for example,

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:44.000
 when you read the books for the teachings,

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:48.000
 or when you're kind of accompanied with practitioners,

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:51.000
 you heard about the teachings.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:54.000
 You heard the saying about the teachings.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:59.000
 This kind of feeling is a little soothing to me.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
 You feel that.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
 And then you read the books.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
 Oh, this is really kind of interesting.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
 I like this. I like to...

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
 I like this kind of interesting.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:13.000
 So you like to explore more, because of that.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:17.000
 Whether you've got the information from your friends,

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:20.000
 or from your books.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:25.000
 That's called clarity devotion, or the path.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
 So it's a big thing.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
 Second, because of that,

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:32.000
 because of that, now you like to explore more.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
 Explore more.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:37.000
 You like to more engaging on that.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
 It's called design.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
 Design. You like to kind of design.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
 Now I like to follow that.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:46.000
 I like to do that, see more, explore more.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:50.000
 So that's called clarity.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:54.000
 Clarity devotion has now become desirable.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:57.000
 Desirable devotion has become stronger.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
 Stronger now.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:02.000
 You like to explore, and you like to more engage.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
 Now you read more, desirable, read,

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
 and start to do it many times.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
 Now really it's appealing to me.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
 Ah, that's really good.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
 It really ranks. I trust it. I like that.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
 Very much.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:20.000
 When you get, then it's called unshakable devotion, or desire.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:23.000
 Unshakable pain, fear.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
 Then it becomes so strong.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
 Then you see.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:30.000
 Even someone says it's not true, this and that.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
 You're never going to give up.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
 You saw the reason.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
 That means that the Buddha's teaching

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:39.000
 poses starting second contemplatives.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:43.000
 You start it, and you react, it makes sense.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
 Now you contemplate it.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:49.000
 Contemplate what the teaching said, what you told.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
 Now it's emerging.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:55.000
 Your knowledge and the teaching are connecting.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:58.000
 It's called contemplations.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:01.000
 Your discover becomes stronger.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:06.000
 Then, after that, then you can give.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:09.000
 Then unshakable devotion.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:13.000
 So those are that.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:18.000
 This, this, and so.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:22.000
 So those are, therefore, one who has this all qualities.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:29.000
 Qualities, and therefore this is the listen nuns.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
 Unpowerful nuns.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:34.000
 And nun is, in it's way, it's called tzumma.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:38.000
 And nun, and of course we all know nun means tzuma,

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:41.000
 but tzuma means they're their kind of mind,

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:46.000
 body, speech, mind are very much really connected

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:49.000
 to the virtues, virtues.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:53.000
 They become the, the body, speech, mind

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:56.000
 become the inseparable from virtues.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:59.000
 The body activity is virtues.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:02.000
 Speech activity is virtues.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:05.000
 And mind activity is virtues.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
 They become kind of targeted.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
 That is called tzuma.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
 Is it a bit?

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
 Pimal is tzuma.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
 Pimal is called tzumba.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:20.000
 Tzumba and tzuma, this is a practice,

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
 name of the practitioners.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:25.000
 So even though maybe they're not completely inseparable

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
 from the virtues, the body, speech, mind,

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
 but at least they're lined up that,

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
 that is a goal, goal.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:34.000
 So that is tzuma.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:39.000
 And then, so soon, so I just go and listen.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:42.000
 Listen is then, of course you all know, listen.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:45.000
 Listen means, sorry.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:50.000
 I'm not, I'm not, you all know, listen.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:54.000
 But in Buddhism, the Buddha's teaching is called

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:58.000
 when you listen, he said there's a,

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
 there's a way to listen.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:08.000
 Listen carefully and listen.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:17.000
 Don't forget what you listen.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:26.000
 And then, listen.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:35.000
 So this example used, used in teaching or presenting,

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:39.000
 when you are in the teaching, teaching or when you're in a group,

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:42.000
 when you don't pay attention, attentive,

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:46.000
 then it's kind of like, you're not really paying any attention.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:50.000
 It looks like port, port is upside down.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:55.000
 So there is no way that growth is upside down, not attentive.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:59.000
 And, and then, second nominika.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:03.000
 Second is, even if you are listening that,

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:08.000
 but you're not kind of keeping that in your memory bank,

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:13.000
 then it looks like you just let it come, but let it go.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:14.000
 It's going away.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:18.000
 That is second error of the, of the winning.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:23.000
 You are attending the practice, listening, listening.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:28.000
 And the third one is then, then even you listen,

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:31.000
 even though you're kind of, is a whole name,

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:34.000
 but then that all the, that's teaching what you received,

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:37.000
 mixed really differently, emotions.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:42.000
 Emotions, kind of skeptical, doubt and hesitations,

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:45.000
 and then kind of judging the teaching, this and that.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:48.000
 All that, then definitely emotions.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:51.000
 Then it's kind of, you mix the teaching,

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:55.000
 with the different, like, poisons, all the different things,

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
 then it's not good.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:01.000
 So therefore, those with all the having that, that,

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
 and listen, then what the greatest teacher,

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:06.000
 Buddha Shakyamuni said in the teaching, teaching is that,

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:10.000
 listen, attentive, listen carefully,

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
 attentively listen carefully,

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:18.000
 then when you keep that in mind, I will teach you.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:19.000
 I will teach you.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
 That's what the Buddha teaching said.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:25.000
 So that's how all that teaching is,

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
 and that's my little teaching.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
 Thank you, everyone, okay?

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:32.000
 Thank you very much.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:33.000
 Thank you very much.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:34.000
 Thank you very much.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
 Thank you very much for participating.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:37.000
 Thank you for coming.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.000
 Thank you.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.000
 Thank you very much.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
 And then today, also, this is,

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:42.000
 we thought to do this,

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
 and one of the hiss on the video,

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:49.000
 (speaking in foreign language)

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:50.000
 in 1987.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
 So it's last two, two days ago.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:55.000
 It's an anniversary, but we're so busy,

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
 kind of everything is not here.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
 We're busy, couldn't make that.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:02.000
 We thought that all that celebration

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:07.000
 or the memories of that practice

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
 of that is afternoon.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
 (speaking in foreign language)

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:12.000
 Thank you.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:15.000
 And then tomorrow, after going to offer the empowerment,

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:19.000
 then of course, I'm teaching in the online,

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:23.000
 and which is, I don't know exactly how I'm qualified all that,

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
 but still, I'm doing that.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:29.000
 But the empowerment, I just feel kind of hesitant

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
 in doing that online.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
 So we're not doing the online.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:38.000
 We're going to do that here, kind of as we used to do

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:42.000
 (speaking in foreign language)

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:45.000
 And then the other tomorrow, we will resume

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:49.000
 from this and thank everyone for participating.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:53.000
 (speaking in foreign language)

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:57.000
 And now we do short meditations

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
 and then dedicate the marriage.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:03.000
 (speaking in foreign language)

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
 (footsteps)

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:15.000
 (speaking in foreign language)
