00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.560
 That is our goal. Have to be clear, precise, detailed, everything clear, as reflection in the moon

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:07.560
 in water.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:15.280
 Water, not solid, not conquered, as rainbow bodies. And Timba means, in Tibet, I think he is also

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:15.460
 here.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:23.360
 He is uncheckable, translate uncheckable, but means also firm. So that means not shaken by the dual

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.260
ity mind.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.200
 Hesitation, doubt, skeptical, this and that. All those are mundane thought.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.680
 All those are the obstacles during the meditation.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.200
 Maybe analyzation time is good. We should analyze.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:43.990
 But when it comes to the practice self, we should maintain ourselves more firm, strong, and then be

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.060
 solid, be strong, confidence on that.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:54.920
 Without the confidence, without this self-confidence and trusty, then the realization and

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.560
 understanding will not come.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.360
 Even in samsara, without the confidence, we cannot really achieve so many things.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.840
 Without confidence means we are shaking, unshaking, we are not sure, we have stopped kind of

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:07.640
 trembling.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:14.680
 That cannot succeed. So therefore, firmness, confidence is very, very important, and that is called

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.920
 uncheckables.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.280
 And then he said like, takwa means purity.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:27.280
 All these different practices, various others, different characteristics, and humility, as well as

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.700
 all this is built from the beginning.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:36.400
 It is not just a mundane status. So that purity is very good to remember everything, for example,

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:44.020
 two arms, two legs, as well as one face, two arms, for example, as to truth, two legs, as to

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.740
 different merits.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:53.390
 I mean, so forth, one after another, there is so many kind of sambole, meaning that it is sambole,

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.160
 it is just a display.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:59.690
 We bring that purity, understanding is very, very important. And union of the male and female is a

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.260
 skillful means in the Western.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:08.210
 I mean, all that, this is called purity, understanding. So again, not involved with the mundane

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.040
 kind of duality status.

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:15.080
 Those are very important to do when we do the meditation.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.920
 Then of course, again, this is sometimes difficult to do this meditation, all that.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:27.730
 But to bring that more kind of workable is then our devotion, our joy, our kind of feel, the

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.520
 presence of that.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.270
 We feel the presence of the various south of male and female, lineage masters with the devotion,

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:36.840
 joy, and body.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.760
 When we have those things, then even if we couldn't keep everything so detailed, it kind of bring

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.320
 all perfect status.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:51.320
 So therefore, the ground foundation is the joy, appreciation, devotion, and as well as then, with

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.420
 the kind of trying to maintain as much as we can,

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:01.580
 then it brings realization and blessings. So trying to maintain all those things as much as we can.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:08.720
 And again, then after all, it is bodhicitta practice, and it is our devotion practices.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.460
 And so kind of thinking of every different levels of all the beings, and then we do these practices

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.760
.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:21.940
 So this is just a brief reminding, and again, you know already, and so we do start with practice.

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.640
 Again, this is one of the very special teachings of these great masters.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.360
 It's not just this great master, but this is the teaching of the Gaurabha Masambhavasandra Kanishin

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.800
 Sahaja.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.600
 And then it goes back to the Buddha Kya Kya Muni. So it is.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:42.900
 And then again, also many great masters often use, this is kind of combined the Numa Kama and the

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:43.100
 Thelma,

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:48.230
 teaching together with this great master, Pratugadha, and then this becomes one of the very

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.360
 important practices in Numa schools.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.490
 And this carried by all the great masters of the Numa, and for example, in these lineage masters,

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:56.900
 when you pray this lineage,

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:02.640
 and there is, for example, also like this continuing pastor from his home, Dunyurum Chittu, and his

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.800
 teacher, as well as him.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:10.920
 So this is the teaching of the Mani Thelma, this is the teaching of the His Honors of Dunyurum Ch

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:11.260
ittu,

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.180
 and this is teaching of all those Numa great masters.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:23.190
 So in that understanding, we practice this, again, with this thought of the Bodhi Thelma, and that

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.640
 is a brief reminding.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.100
 And now we begin this practice, okay?

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.100
 That is, we start.
