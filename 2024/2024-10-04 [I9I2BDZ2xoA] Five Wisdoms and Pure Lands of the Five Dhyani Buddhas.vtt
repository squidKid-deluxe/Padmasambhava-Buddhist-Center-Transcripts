00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.040
 He has said we really mention to the Five Gaius and the Five Wisdom, Five Wisdom.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.840
 And the Five Wisdom, generally, of course, we all know, we heard so many times that.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.080
 But Dhammadattu Wisdom, what that means actually?

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:25.200
 The Dhammadattu Wisdom is all these Four Wisdom, Five Wisdom are, they are not solid or existing.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:31.200
 Everything is open, emptiness.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:38.400
 So that means all the Four Wisdom are best on the Dhammadattu Wisdom.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.400
 Dhammadattu Wisdom.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:46.160
 So Dhammadattu Wisdom is the emptiness aspect of the Wisdom.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:57.280
 The openness aspect of the Wisdom. Embrace it. Openness. That is Dhamadattu Wisdom.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:05.960
 Let's pour down the Four Wisdom, those Four Wisdom, clarity aspect of the Dhammadattu, clarity

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.040
 aspect.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:19.840
 And the Merolang Wisdom is a metaphor. That Wisdom, the Buddha Wisdom, that all the everything,

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:32.720
 both Samsara, Narana, and the Path to the Narana, all reflect within the Merolang Wisdom.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:40.580
 Everything. As the Merolang, everything is reflected. Path, prison, the future, everything is

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:41.680
 reflected.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.800
 So it's an example, metaphor, how they reflect.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:56.320
 And then, equanimity Muslims, even they reflect everything in that Merolang, great Merolang Wisdom.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:03.840
 Muslims, in the Wisdom level, everything is equal. There's no difference in place.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:11.840
 All are completely equal. Completely are one state. There's no difference.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:18.960
 Different. And the third one, Third Wisdom or Fourth Wisdom.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.960
 Discrimination ever is Wisdom. That means even it is reflecting everything in that Merolang,

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:31.360
 and everything is equal, but yet it's not mixed up. It's so precise.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:40.710
 It's so distinct. Everything, exactly as it is. But that is exactly, clearly, precisely, everything

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:41.280
.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.160
 Everything. Exactly that. So this is discrimination,

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:54.640
 awareness, wisdom. That's seeing everything. So detailed. So precise. In the Buddha's teaching,

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.880
 the wisdom point of view of the Buddha's wisdom, or the Buddha's point of view,

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:11.760
 there's nothing is hiding. Nothing is unknown. All is clear. How that's clear? In one instant,

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:20.720
 moment sees everything. And not below. Not mixed up. Not mixed up. That's true.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:29.840
 Because of that, then and then, Buddha, propelling all activity through that wisdom,

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:36.080
 beneficial activities, all that aspect is all accomplished in those. In the Buddha's teaching

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:42.720
 often, when I teach him, Buddha sees everything. Who is having difficulties?

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:50.800
 Who is having kind of good performance? And Buddha sees everything, really perfectly.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:59.120
 Accordingly, readiness, and there, according karma, Buddha helps. So that is the wisdom.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:08.240
 Now that the wisdom is reflected in the parkaya. So sorry, next one here is the park viewland.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:13.600
 That the wisdom is reflected in the parkaya. It's Buddha's viewland.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:22.720
 Viewland is not the, not the kind of externally solid example. It's display of the wisdom.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:30.240
 And similarly for us, for our, this world is display of the karma,

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:38.560
 humanities. But Buddha's viewland, that's why it's called viewland. Viewland is the view,

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:46.880
 this is the viewland of the wisdom display. And there is then five, there are many numbers of

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:54.800
 viewland, but they are known one or highlight as the five viewland. And those are known as

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:03.280
 in the center. Center viewland is called in the debate world, the very abundance, viewland of

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:10.320
 abundance, if you translate it. The east viewland is known as viewland of the Delight Force,

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:16.720
 Gomorrah Gavachand. And the south viewland is a very luxurious, the glorious viewland,

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:23.680
 also upon the dimension. That's what any people, that's it. And then west viewland is,

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:35.280
 viewland is sukawati, or the devotee nation, or great blissfulness. And the next one is the north,

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:45.040
 is the viewland of the completely, all the activities, activated, the viewland,

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:54.560
 or the proponent, all the activities. And later, those are five viewlands. How those viewlands are?

00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:01.600
 In the teachings, I mean, I say it's viewland here, or it's view, perfect. It's not reflective of

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:01.600
 the

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:10.800
 karma, dualities, it's truly reflections of the versus, versus love and compassion. Therefore,

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:19.440
 it's called viewlands. And then that's what? In that viewland, then the palace of the deities

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:33.680
 is known as that proportion, proportion and the proportion and the measurement are unbelievable,

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:39.840
 unbelievable, inconceivable. It's called an intubated Yaryekes. It's something unbelievable,

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:57.520
 so amazing, beautiful palace. In that palace, then what? And then that viewland is so old time,

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:06.800
 the viewland, everything is glowing, so bright, glowing, and so appealing, appealing, appealing.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 And then that viewland in that palace, in the throne, and if I use the regular word,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:23.840
 the furniture of that viewland is just so beautiful. Really, there's nothing to compare, perfect.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:31.680
 All the thrones and the seats and everything is just displayed, are perfect.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:40.960
 And that viewland, one of them, another one, is called the inconceivable laryx of all

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:50.000
 pipe-sensor objects. Those are known pipe-golent of the sambokaya brothers, pipe-golent, all that

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:58.430
 is complete. So this viewland is so perfect. And then, here's the pipe mothers and the pipe fathers

00:07:58.430 --> 00:07:58.560
,

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:04.000
 those are, I think we went yesterday too, I mean, same thing. Pipe fathers are

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:13.040
 such as then pipe-golent of the others, those pipe-golent of the others. And I think yesterday,

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:20.480
 yeah, pipe-golent of the others, yeah, pipe-golent of the others, and those are, again, and

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:34.720
 veracana, and vegir sattva, renna sambava, and amitaba, and amogasada, I think it's pipe,

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:41.120
 that's the pipe brothers. And then, I think yesterday, I can't believe we had, maybe we

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:48.160
 mentioned already correctly, but I mentioned that with those pipe, what's called pipe,

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:54.160
 aggregate transformed, the pipe-golent, Buddha, I can do a little bit mixed out,

00:08:54.160 --> 00:09:01.120
 a wobbling, a wobbling, and that, a wobbling, again, I will say, the foam,

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:11.280
 aggregate is the Buddha vervajana, and then the peeling aggregate is the Buddha renna sambava,

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:20.000
 construction aggregate is Buddha amitaba, and the construction aggregate is Buddha amogasada,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:26.960
 and as well as then, that the consciousness aggregate is Buddha vervajana, that is now,

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:32.320
 and I said that yesterday, that's the correct, if they didn't say exactly that number, this was

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:42.320
 really correct. And then, five mothers are, such as five mothers are, I mean, yesterday,

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:47.360
 I think I mentioned, I mean, here, I said that, but I'll just list the names. Five mothers are

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:57.040
 Reja Dattu, Dattu Shuri, or Doji Unsoma, and Sadi Thima, Mamaki, Gurukaramu, and Tamsak

00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:04.240
 Gurma, those are the three names, and the five female Buddhas, female Buddhas. So, all that is

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:11.040
 also part of the Dukki, so that means part of our own awareness, part of our own true nature,

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:16.480
 and then three duels, and the three duels are the, of course, the Buddha Dharma Sanghas,

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:23.040
 and the Buddha Dharma Sanghas, in an absolute level, I mentioned yesterday, one's own awareness

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:31.440
 is the true living Buddha, and through that, love and compassion, wisdom is a shiny, that is Dharma

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:31.440
,

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:38.160
 and when they activate that quality, then it's Sangha, Sangha. So, Buddha Dharma Sangha,

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:46.240
 absolute level, is always with us, excellent level, and the Buddha is, for example, Buddha,

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:55.360
 Sakyamuni is like Buddha. And then, Dharma is his teachings, Buddha's teachings, and those are

00:10:55.360 --> 00:11:03.040
 Nainan teachings, all three basket teachings, what your terminology use, all those are teachings.

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:09.440
 Sangha members who follow in those teachings, and such as the Theravada Sangha members,

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:14.800
 Mahayana Sangha members, Rayayana Sangha members, all are Sangha members.

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:21.360
 All are Sangha members, and they say that, so really about the three duels, three duels,

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:24.720
 duels, and then three roots.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:40.080
 Three roots are in the Rayayana teaching, is also according, generally Mahayana teaching,

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:46.080
 Buddha Dharma Sangha, those are the three object categories. And in the Rayayana teaching,

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:53.600
 then three roots are also like the way Buddha Dharma Sangha. So root, who are they? That is

00:11:53.600 --> 00:12:00.560
 Guru, is root of the blessings, is a Guru, and a root of the accomplished human is.

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:13.200
 Yadam deities, root of and activity is. Beneficial activity is the Dakini's and the Dharmapada's,

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:21.280
 those are known as three roots. And again, in a Guru representing the Buddha,

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:33.280
 and deities or the Yadams represented as Dharma, and Dakini's Dharmapada represented as Sangha

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:33.600
 members,

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:43.280
 Sanghas. So those are really explaining about the three roots, that. And then here, lineage,

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:50.400
 lineage, root, and three lineage, and also all the three lineage can be, I mean,

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:56.000
 these songs, three lineage can be as like, all the three lineages of the Dukhi teachings,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.880
 all lineages of those like, five lineages, those are the Buddha families,

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:08.080
 radio families, and Buddha, sorry, Buddha families, radio families,

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:16.480
 retina families, karma, pema families, karma family, those are the wrecks. See, wrecks,

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:22.400
 those are all. And those are also, even though it's named those different families,

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:29.840
 but reality really, it's all of this place. Even the pema family, for example, pema family,

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:37.920
 embodies all the five dhyana Buddhas. So that means the pema family, which has all the five dhyana

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:45.680
 Buddhas, pema family of the Buddha family, pema family of the Vedya family, pema family of the

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:54.400
 Rana family, pema family of the Karma family, pema family of the of the Vedya family. They all,

00:13:54.400 --> 00:14:00.240
 each of those, again, have them, it's not restricted as three, because it's display of the

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:08.880
 primordial wisdom. Therefore, there's 100,000 really this, this place that emanated as it

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:15.920
 needed. But when it comes to the one single state, back to that, then in the teaching version to

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:15.920
 the

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:22.480
 Vedas, sadhva status. And that comes to where? To the primordial wisdom, the youthful vast body.

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:32.240
 That is an youthful vast body is residing to our heart, our soul, everyone else is now in the vast

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:40.560
 race. But when it's filled up, what the great master Narayana said, we knew the vast is in,

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:47.680
 in the vast, there is in great master Narayana used example as inside the vast, there's light,

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:56.640
 lamp, L-A-M-P, lamp, inside the lamp. But so that lamp is inside the vast and can see the light.

00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:04.640
 But if you push one hole to the lamp, and by the Vedya of the Samadhi, if you push the hole

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:14.800
 to one way, and light comes out, if you push two, more light come, if you push three, will come.

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:22.320
 If the Vedya Samadhi breath that vast completely, that light, the spell, the entire

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:33.520
 Dharmadathos completely become light, right? This vast, vast is the obscurations. Great

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:39.520
 Street of Buddha used example, seven length of the human beings, underneath that trade,

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:52.000
 used yesterday. It's deep. Why so deep? Why so thin? We accumulated unintentionally from the

00:15:52.000 --> 00:16:01.600
 beginner's times. And still we're adding, adding unintentionally. That habit pattern is thick and

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:08.710
 strong, strong. So our practice of meditation, we're doing that with short time, it won't

00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:09.200
 immediately,

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:15.680
 but still is really brain good result. Because the power of the skillful means technique of the

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:23.440
 Vedayana teachings, we have the most powerful skillful means of teachings, can dispel that,

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:30.960
 dispel that. And that, so that's a lineage. And then mandala, mandala here mentioned,

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:39.280
 mandala, and that is again, of course, we all know the mandala, mandala, this is mandala, mandala.

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:41.280
 But it is so controversial.
