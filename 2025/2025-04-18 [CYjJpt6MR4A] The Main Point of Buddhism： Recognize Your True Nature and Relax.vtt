NOTE     "synopsis": "PSL One Month Dzogchen Retreat\nChetsun Nyingtik\nVen. Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche\n\nPadma Samye Ling retreat center\nApril 12 - May 10, 2025\n\nDay 3\nApril 18, 2025\n\nThe first Dzogchen masters left this world in a characteristic way: in a rainbow body of light after giving a final teaching to their disciples. In Tibet, the ones who spread the Nyingtik (heart essence) teaching of Clear Light were the great masters who possessed their special direct transmission, chiefly the great scholar Vimalamitra and Guru Padmasambhava. Vimalamitra passed these instructions to Chetsun Senge Wangchuk, who also attained the rainbow body. The teachings he left were later revealed by the First Khyentse, and are part of the secret category of Dzogchen pith instructions, Mengagde.\n\nThese rare and extraordinarily profound teachings precisely explain various essential methods for directly actualizing the innermost teachings of Ati Dzogpa Chenpo, the Great Perfection, the Peak Vehicle, which is the direct method for swiftly realizing the ultimate nature of the mind and attaining buddhahood in the rainbow light body.\n\nwww.padmasambhava.org",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720
 help you discover yourself by one's own cognitions.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.360
 That is mother of the old, the Buddha's.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.920
 I pay homage. That is a roughly translation.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:24.160
 That is nature of the awareness or nature of the rippa.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.880
 When you look to the looker,

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.560
 use the technique of the pixelables or just look to the looker.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:44.240
 That moment, we discovered the trail that we ignored so long time.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.800
 Really we ignored.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.800
 Now we rediscover, rediscover.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.040
 Then we just say we have to relax.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:03.120
 That is the really the nature of the mind in the teaching sense.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.320
 That, and we discovered exactly as it is.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.480
 Exactly as it is.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.000
 For those reasons, therefore, very famous.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.480
 I thought this is really one of the kind of ways.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.520
 I mean, those are, I mean, so special,

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.040
 those old pointing out teachings by many great masters.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.000
 One after another when they explain,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.920
 so special and that is again,

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.000
 I mentioned to you quite a few times,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.480
 great master, what's called Atisha,

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.800
 and he's a foremost disciple, Ramthamba, Jabran Yuni.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:51.760
 There's a book known as the dialogue between master and the teachers.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.800
 And I think in that teaching, this is the quotation,

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.400
 I'm just taking the quotation.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.000
 And from that teaching said Ramthamba Jabran said,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.480
 his disciples said to Atisha,

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:11.360
 the master, I looked so many times, did not saw anything.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.160
 That's what the Ramthamba said to the Atisha.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.400
 I looked so many times, I didn't see anything.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.800
 That means talking about the mind.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.840
 I didn't not see anything.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.720
 So Atisha said, Ram, he called Ram,

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.560
 you saw the true nature again and again.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.280
 You saw the nature again and again.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:48.200
 And then again, Ram, Atisha, sorry, Ram said,

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.920
 master, then I have to just relax on that,

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.600
 that when I don't show anything, I just have to relax,

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.920
 or when I don't find any relax in that status.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:08.120
 And then Atisha said, yes, relax, calmly, peacefully.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.800
 Calmly, relaxing, peacefully in that status.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.640
 That is really nugget point.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.680
 Again, pointing out, seeing that exactly.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.760
 There's nothing to see.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.800
 That you already mind, they like to grab something,

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.360
 clingy something, hold something.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.280
 But nature is free from grabbing,

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.280
 free from grasping, free from clinging.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:40.960
 It's open, vastness, as like a blue sky.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.080
 And then that is also a gracious teacher,

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.960
 the Buddha said in the Pandya Paramada teaching,

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.880
 said, I also said quite a few times, say that.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:55.560
 When purpose, people say, I saw sky.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.200
 When purpose say, I saw the sky.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.960
 But when you ask them, what you saw the sky,

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:12.400
 what you saw the space, but this blue sky is not sky.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.200
 So this is what you see.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.880
 This is a space.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.560
 When you see space, people say, I see space.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.400
 But what do you saw spaces?

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.880
 Then what do you explain?

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.520
 There's nothing to explain it.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.160
 That was, again, gracious teacher Buddha said,

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.600
 that is exactly the same, seeing the nature as it is.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:44.120
 When you see that, now, then you have to relax.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:49.960
 You have to abide in that status with joy, with appreciation,

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.600
 with devotion, with bodhicata.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.720
 Even joy in bodhicata and devotion,

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.520
 those are display of this emptiness mind.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:09.360
 There's no solid existence, it's all immediately accented.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.280
 Immediately it is dissolved or liberated.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.360
 It is all stated without any trace.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.440
 This is the nature.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.720
 We have to abide, continue.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:33.360
 This practice of this, this is called the cuckoo practices.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.400
 Cuckoo means what?

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.800
 Of course, you all know.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.120
 Cutting poorly, instantly.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.320
 What cut? All duality consumption.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.280
 Instantly liberated.

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:52.520
 It also encompasses all those teachings, those teachings.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.280
 Tritu encompasses the Pandyaparamada teaching.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.880
 Tritu encompasses the Mademaga teaching.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.480
 Tritu encompasses the Mahamudra teachings.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:05.120
 Tritu encompasses those pacifying teachings.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:10.280
 Tritu encompasses all the dual practices, everything.

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:19.360
 So therefore, tritu is the embodiment of all the practices.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.240
 For that reason, with great confidence,

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:28.040
 make one resolution, one determination,

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:33.120
 restainting the familiar of our nature.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.800
 Make more familiar of the nature.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.080
 It's really the practices.
