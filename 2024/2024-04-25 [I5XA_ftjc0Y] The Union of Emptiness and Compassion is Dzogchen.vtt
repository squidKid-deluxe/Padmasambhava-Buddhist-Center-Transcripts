00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.670
 Thank you everyone, again, thank you, everyone, thank you, welcome, everyone, thank you, thank you,

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.820
 everyone, good morning, good morning, thank you, thank you.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:21.300
 Again we continue to follow the teaching and so follow the teaching according to my capabilities,

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.220
 all what we can observe with teaching.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:31.810
 The teaching is so vast and profound and deep and a nugget directly revealing of our energy and

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:32.820
 nature.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:41.370
 But really our duality mind and this knowledge is limited because of due to this obscration, so

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.980
 that how much we can observe, how much we can really take.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:51.810
 But whatever we observe, whatever we've got, that we should take that with courage, commitment, and

00:00:51.810 --> 00:01:00.060
 with a lawyer, with determination, really trying to bring some result in our lives.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:07.180
 Where we have life, this life, and it reminds us how much we have, how long we have, we don't know,

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.780
 but how whatever it is, we like to make something that we can carry, go with us,

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.340
 and leave this wall with this nugget. All the material things, what we are all going to love,

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:24.780
 something so good, beautiful, inspiring to develop in other ways, now and in the future.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.400
 But some nugget, what we carry is really teaching that our practice and meditation, meditation,

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.700
 what we practice, that is really something that we carry.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.830
 That will help us this lifetime and it will help and continue sparking and brighten our future, the

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.460
 rest of the nation.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.180
 So that is what really is so important and so beneficial that.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:56.320
 And that's why all the great masters, great practitioners of the lineage, everything went through

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.060
 that, through that, inspired themselves, inspire others.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.440
 And then also the bundles of the realization and the qualities and the richness, they reworked from

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:13.840
 the gift of their own, the nature of the mind, and carried that, that, that, and inspired and

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.020
 brightened up their destination in the future lives.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.980
 So that is what is really the meaning of the practices.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:30.280
 And Mahayana practices, of course, in Vedayana practice is best upon the body getters. Again, as we

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.060
 always remind each other, joy in appreciation.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:39.580
 That is so important. I'm not saying it's important. That is fundamental of our foundation of the

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.740
 practice, joy in appreciation.

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:48.640
 We practice with joy. We practice with devotion. We practice with appreciation, thankful, grateful

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:49.180
ness.

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:56.380
 That is how we begin, brighten up with that, then add the body getters, kind and compete.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:04.500
 And we've all heard so many songs on the body getters, and we know that what means intellectually,

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.180
 but also kind of activating body getters each and every time.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.620
 And every session in the teachings, it is so important, activating body getters.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.840
 Every session we need to be practicing. Every session, joy in the devotion, in the appreciation,

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:21.900
 activating.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:29.820
 And every session, although understanding and reminding of the pole, renunciation pole, pole point

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:36.620
 that will reverse our mind from the samsara attachment, samsara mind.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:43.230
 It's something, whatever you practice, those are each session in the teachings. It's so good. It's

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:43.980
 not just teaching.

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:51.340
 That's what all those practitioners suggest is great realizing being, such as Malarepa, Nunkinpa,

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.700
 and all this Maha-Ragoda, Jammu-Kundra.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:01.650
 I mean, all, really, you name it. All the new people, but every one follow that same, but they don

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.060
't have any different things than us.

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:09.790
 They have no kind of special kind of session they do practices. What they practice, what they've

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:18.220
 got, the realization will follow in the same thing, same teaching, same path, same techniques.

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:25.280
 That's what, because they shared as their realization, they shared their techniques, they shared

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.700
 our experience.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:33.420
 Buddha did it too. When he got the realization, the enlightenment, then he shared the knowledge

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.180
 with love and compassion, exactly as it is.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:43.420
 That's what I was received by all these great practitioners, masters, arabas, bodhisattvas.

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:50.590
 They got those realization. They shared that. They continued. And that's what we were really

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:51.420
 following that.

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:59.890
 And then now, everyone, that was the following. So, again, we have all those good and true, and

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:02.540
 attitude, and thought, and with that.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:07.660
 And then, also, we were reading and teaching, offering, or doki teaching, seeing everything,

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.100
 everything is three kaya state, three kaya state.

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:17.580
 And she sees that. That means the subject is three kaya, object is three kaya. We went all the day.

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:24.660
 Kya Khwa Thalurana, a great master, pointed out very clearly that this whole, everything, how is it

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.140
 three kaya state.

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:32.140
 And so, those kind of mind, those is very important. That's how we really begin.

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:36.940
 Now, we go to the teaching itself, but I just thought, oh, look, thought, let me, of course, we all

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:37.500
 know.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:43.340
 But I thought, let's talk a little bit of bodhisattva. Bodhisattva has two bodhisattva, of course,

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:44.620
 you know.

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:51.020
 A relative bodhisattva and an absolute true bodhisattva. Doki teaching is an absolute true bodhis

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.660
attva.

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:57.120
 That's an absolute true bodhisattva. And a relative bodhisattva, I thought, a little bit also

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.220
 discussed that.

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:06.300
 You never have to remind each other, ask either. And bodhisattva is a combination of compassion and

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.260
 a loving kindness and a great wisdom.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:15.260
 All the emptiness, every symbol you tell, emptiness and the compassion, united thought.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:22.460
 That union of is known as bodhika. In the teaching of prasāgya and some making, the compassion is

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.100
 more projected at these two aspects.

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:29.740
 Compassion is more projected to the old beings of six lambs.

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:35.820
 That, of course, see the situation of all the difficulty, troubles of the old beings of six lambs.

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:41.600
 Even we didn't see all the beings of six lambs, due to our, again, due to our limitation of

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:42.380
 knowledge.

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:49.580
 But we see so many beings. We see human beings. We see the animal rams. So many beings.

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:57.180
 And we see how much they struggle. According to Buddhism, everyone has the same intention.

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:05.860
 Be happy, be joy, be peaceful. It doesn't matter whatever the point they have, whether they can

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.460
 express their feelings or not.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:14.860
 The deep don't desire is the same in Buddhism. There is no difference.

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:21.180
 Whether it is small, whether it is big, or whether it is just medium, or whatever can make them the

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:22.780
 other. Really.

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:30.780
 So we see so many beings, the human beings. And human beings are considering upper three rams,

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:38.140
 one of the upper three rams. We all know that. There are six rams. Three upper rams is one of them.

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:44.390
 Upper ram is human beings. But even human beings, how much we devote through the challenge in the

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:45.980
 difficulties.

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:55.820
 Everyone wants the same desire as I, as you, want to be happy, peaceful, healthy, joy, and

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:57.420
 fulfillment.

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:03.580
 And well-being. That's what we do, praise you. Well-being and fulfillment. That's the desires.

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:10.460
 And that is to all the beings, and all everyone. But not getting that.

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:17.970
 Not they are receiving that. But they are achieving that. In the Grand Master Dargadatta, Shanti

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:19.340
 Deva said,

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:29.420
 Shanti said, "Why is that happening? Because our ignorance, even there is good cause to be happy in

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:30.780
 the joy and peace,

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:38.460
 due to the ignorance, we spoil. Completely do the opposite. Instead, making something nice and

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:38.940
 beautiful

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:45.030
 that would help you to ask. But due to the ignorance, we think that's the best we should do, and we

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:46.620
 spoil."

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:54.780
 And what do you say that? And in it, debate. Deva and beauty, the more present, if you have done

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:55.580
 this,

00:08:55.580 --> 00:09:04.540
 the destroying one's own cause of happiness, happiness, happiness as by enemies. As enemies.

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:10.940
 We call it anyone who is destroying us. And the cause of happiness, one's own happiness,

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:20.060
 destroyed by ourself as by enemies because of our ignorance. Ignorance and unknowing situations.

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:26.300
 So that's the dilemma, all of that. Therefore, then, in the teaching, always,

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:32.830
 both each other, loving kindness taught, comparing the thought for all the beings, everyone has the

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:34.300
 same desire.

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:41.740
 And although not just the same desire, everyone has the same nature, same quality, same potential

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:50.140
 as we, or as I, as you, everyone. Everyone has a Buddha nature, enlightenment nature. No one is

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:58.380
 out of that. But yet, so many varieties of the all different things, situations, going through,

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:05.900
 experiencing through them. Why? Because due to our cause of the suffering truth or the ignorance.

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:15.420
 Cause of the suffering truth has 5,000 or 3,000, but fundamentally, which is, is ignorance.

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:25.100
 Ignorance created the ego cleanliness. Ego, ignorant is so. Ego cleanliness is supported,

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:33.100
 maintained by the ignorance. Ignorance. And then all the other emotions are created by the

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:43.020
 ignorance. So we make all this thinking of good things, making all that. And then that becomes

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:50.780
 the cause of suffering truth. Then result. There is a cause. If there is a conjugate,

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:58.860
 the result cannot stop. Cannot stop. If cause is there, if conjugate is there,

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:08.380
 absolutely 100% one, the result will come. That's the rule of the systems. It will come.

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:15.660
 So going through all the different causes, different experiences. Therefore, then this

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:23.500
 compassion versus combined triggers is so important. And that is, and bodhicata, as you all know,

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:32.860
 it has two. A relative bodhicata has two. Wishing bodhicata and actualizing bodhicata. Or engaging

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:39.260
 bodhicata. Or activating bodhicata. Many great oscillators, I saw that oscillated differently,

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:48.460
 is actualizing bodhicata. I always say, actualize bodhicata. First is intention bodhicata. And the

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:55.260
 second is what you have intended in the heart and mind, actualizing that with the mind, with the

00:11:55.260 --> 00:12:02.210
 heart, with the physical, with the bubble, activating the actualizing bodhicata. Or engaging bodhic

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:02.540
ata.

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:10.780
 Engaging bodhicata. So that is. And at this aspiration, wishing bodhicata. Thinking of all

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:17.020
 means. The other is one way. May all living beings have the happiness, the cause of happiness.

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:23.740
 Every living being has great happiness. Really wishing every living being. We don't need any

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:30.460
 distractions, partiality. Every living being, whether we see, whether we don't see, whether we

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:37.340
 know, whether we don't know. Reaching sincerely. And dedicating our marriage, every activity, our

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:44.540
 virtuous activity. Meditation, practicing, starting at every, those virtues dedicated

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:51.740
 to all those beings. As great bodhisattva, meditation is doing and as great bodhisattva,

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:58.540
 summon the Buddha into it. Also the great teacher, Buddha mentioned these two great bodhisattva has

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:04.860
 the best capability, the best way to dedicate a marriage for all living beings. That's the

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:11.500
 really in the teaching sense. If we don't know exactly how to dedicate a marriage, I will dedicate

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:18.380
 my all the virtues, my all the marital activities of the past and the present and the preachers,

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:26.860
 and all together. All together and plus all the marital activities of the buddhas, bodhisattva,

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:32.940
 right now performing, right now that performing. Those all marital activities and all the ordinary

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:40.780
 business as me or I ask what they are doing or good activities. Though they are married, you can

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:47.900
 kind of put together all that as one package and then distribute to all the sentient beings,

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:56.620
 to all living beings. As great bodhisattva, summon the Buddha and meditation is dedicated.

00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:02.140
 If we do that in the teaching sense, it is so much powerful, effective,

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:09.260
 effective for very powerful to help with all the beings, all the beings, but also it helps us.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:16.140
 Ask what it does. It purifies obscurations. It accommodates the merits.

00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:23.580
 Not just only that, one time when we dedicate the merit in the right way, in the teaching sense,

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:29.660
 that will last forever because you pay merit dedicated for all living beings,

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:36.460
 for their enlightenment. Until there is enlightenment, our merit will continue increase

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:45.420
 and that means also our negative obscuration is puttified, continuous. So that's why one in the

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:51.500
 teaching mentioned that among all the virtues, the relative to the virtues, the activity,

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:58.700
 dedication is one very powerful meritually activated. It's best on the compassion and

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:06.060
 bodhisattva in a good heart and really wishing to every living being, living beings, good things.

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:14.780
 So that is what the bodhisattva is. And then as you all know, with that more wishing bodhisattva,

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:21.900
 with that intention, that thought, more activated that bodhisattva is poor, immeasurable. And often

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:31.260
 I translate it, poor, boundless. Whether you put poor, boundless, or poor, immeasurable, it's the

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:40.620
 same one thing. It is what it is. And immeasurable has in the teaching sense, it has, why it's

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:40.940
 called

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:50.140
 immeasurable? It has so many immeasurable powers, immeasurable powers. First, immeasurable power,

00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:57.500
 because we're dedicated in that vision today, that all living beings. So in our heart, in the mind,

00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:06.220
 where the arising is immeasurable, immeasurable, we don't, we don't have limitation of our

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:11.660
 awareness of Rupa, as we're discussing in the Dukki teaching. Rupa has no boundaries,

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:20.700
 no limitation. Rupa is pervasive as a sky that we learn, that arising from that,

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:28.060
 this bodhisattva is arising from that, poor, immeasurable, arising from the Rupa.

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:37.900
 So the soul is immeasurable, and the way of projecting is immeasurable. We cannot put

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:46.220
 numbers of living beings. How many beings of six rams a day? Countless. One gracious teacher,

00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:57.820
 Buddha said, as far as space goes, that far sentient beings exist, or beings exist. As long

00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:07.900
 as sentient beings exist, they all have the emotions, and as long as they have the emotions,

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:15.900
 they have the karmas. They have the karmas. As long as they have the karmas, that long,

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:25.420
 they are challenging, difficulty, struggle. So our compassion, this body that we project to all the

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:36.620
 living beings, so the object is immeasurable. Subject is immeasurable, and then benefit

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:48.300
 is immeasurable, immeasurable, benefit to all the beings, and as well as accumulated merit is

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:55.580
 immeasurable for us. Even without bodhisattva's compassion, without bodhisattva's loving kindness,

00:17:55.580 --> 00:18:02.300
 small love and compassion, with regular love and compassion, has so much power in the teaching

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:11.580
 state. It really has so much power. But bodhisattva is limitless, boundless love, not just love,

00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:18.140
 not just compassion. It's boundless love, boundless compassion for all living beings.

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:25.260
 That's called beauty and performance of the bodhisattva's love and compassion.

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:34.140
 So this, when we develop that, looking practitioners, always in the teaching state,

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:44.060
 the great master, when you read, and Muharramudri read their life stories or their spiritual songs,

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:51.580
 how much they have compassion, how much they have love, how much they have kindness,

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:58.860
 really. And the great master, Muharramudri read all those. Realizing the beings, when they got

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:04.380
 a realization of the absolute truth and nature of the mind, their heart is filled with compassion.

00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:13.420
 Heart is filled with loving kindness, and compassion and a realization of the emptiness

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:20.780
 goes target, comes to target. There is a story. It's not a story. It's a true story.

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:26.140
 Not just a story. It's a teaching state. And the great master

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:35.020
 Atisha, when he came to Tibet, when he came to Tibet, he gave so many teachings. He stayed

00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:43.100
 about 10 years in Tibet, and he gave a lot of teachings. One of the foremost students was

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:53.180
 Dr. Thumba Dhyabranjuni. Dr. Thumba Dhyabranjuni was as his attendance, and I think it looks like

00:19:53.180 --> 00:20:00.220
 attendance. He's the principal disciple of Tibet. Even he came to Tibet, one of the principal

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:07.420
 purposes is to meet Dr. Thumba Dhyabranjuni in the teaching state. He said before he's coming from

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:13.820
 India, he hesitated going to Tibet, because the Tibet is foreign, and the calamity, and all this

00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:21.020
 food and style is all really different than India. So he kind of hesitated, but then he prayed to

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:31.100
 Tara, and Tara is like his personal or duty or he has to protect him, and he can see Tara and

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:38.780
 see the teaching directly from Tara. So he asked Tara whether he should go to Tibet or not. It will

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:49.340
 benefit or not. He said, "Oh, stay here." Tara said, "If you go to Tibet, you will benefit to the

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:56.380
 teaching so much, and particularly one individually you will meet. Through that, you can benefit

00:20:56.380 --> 00:21:03.500
 so, or the teaching, teaching, teaching, and the being so much. If you stay, but if you go to Tibet

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:03.500
,

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:09.740
 it will shorten it, shorten your lives, shorten your life, but it becomes very powerful. If you

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:17.100
 stay here in India, your life will be longer than going to Tibet." So then he decided, "Oh,

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:24.540
 everything is benefiting for the beings and the techies. That is my whole purpose and wish. I'm

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:30.350
 going over. I'm going." So that's where he came. And that purpose, one individual that Tara

00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:31.180
 mentioned,

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:39.340
 was Dron Dron Bajevarayun, that he was foremost disciple of the Dron Dron, sorry, articias. So

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:50.620
 one time, Dron Dron asked to articias. Articias, he said, "Every converse of all the teachings of

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:50.780
 the

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:56.940
 Buddha put together in a more simple way, what is that practice? What is this that teaching is?"

00:21:56.940 --> 00:22:10.060
 Articias says, "That is union of the emptiness and compassion. That is the essence of all the

00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:17.180
 Buddha teachings. What even Buddha gave the teaching from day one is teaching at Varanasi

00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:25.260
 and at Mahatma in Narayana, age 81 of that. The whole of 45 years his teaching, combined in one

00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:32.220
 simple way, is compassion and emptiness, united target. Empliness is also known as

00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:44.300
 wisdom and compassion target. That is." And then Dron Bajevaras asked that, "How does that come

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:51.100
 if it's all token like that?" Many people said, "I've got the realization of emptiness. I've got

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:58.220
 the realization of emptiness." But they're so emotional. So emotional, they really can't lie.

00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:05.660
 They have so much emotions. Why they say, "Why is that great teacher?" And the articias said, "Oh,

00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:19.260
 that will of the emptiness become called maut maut m-o-u-t-h. It's only here. Up to here,

00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:27.420
 it's not in here. So in the Tibetan we call it kata. Kata means will of maut, will of maut,

00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:33.340
 but it's really God's realization. Ever you have the realization of emptiness,

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:41.260
 exactly as it is, that person will become so kind in the compassion that compassion and

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:46.380
 emptiness can't target. Why? Because we're in the zouki teaching.

00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:51.820
 Nature of the mind, the zouki is the union of the wisdom and compassion,

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:59.420
 wisdom and compassion. When we refer that without a block of the ego clinging to the

00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:08.060
 obscurations, then that compassion is of all mercy. And we took it with the realization

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:16.380
 of the zouki, great peace. And he said, "All that," he said, "if you have the realization of the

00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:24.300
 emptiness and compassion, that person becomes so gentle, so peaceful, and overwhelming of the

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:32.380
 compassion, compassion is like one medicine that cures all the diseases.

00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:40.700
 This realization of the emptiness and compassion together is cured all the obscurations,

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:50.860
 all the emotions, all will be cured by that. And then the disciple, great master, who is a great

00:24:50.860 --> 00:25:01.340
 master too, really very famous, he asked how that can happen. He said, "All the Buddha teachings,

00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:13.420
 all the practice teachings, all can be summarized into six paramatas. All the teaching can be

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:20.460
 summarized or practiced in six paramatas. When you have the realization,

00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:28.460
 of the great emptiness and compassion together, that individually don't have

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:38.540
 that too much attachment, too much attachment to anything, therefore that person has generous

00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:46.620
 the paramata always without any interruptions, because they don't have attachment, too much

00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:55.420
 external or inner things. Generous practice always, not just once in a while, once in a while,

00:25:55.420 --> 00:26:02.860
 always. When you have the realization of that realization of the emptiness and compassion

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:11.100
 together, that person don't have the division, such as partitions of the "me" and the "you"

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:21.260
 with anger and with attachment. And therefore, that person will never do any unwholesome activities

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:21.260
.

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:30.780
 Therefore, that person individually has morality, paramata, always continue uninterrupted

00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:39.660
 all the time. They have that. And that person, when you have that realization of the emptiness

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:46.940
 and the union of the emptiness and the compassion together, they don't have see, this also have,

00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:58.060
 don't have any negative emotions, angers, angers. Then they have always, always a passion paramata.

00:26:58.060 --> 00:27:07.500
 Always a passion paramata without any interruption, interrupted. When you have realization of that

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:12.780
 great emptiness and compassion together, that person is not distracted by anything,

00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:22.460
 by anything. All kinds of feelings like slow or laziness, they are always, so this is not

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:29.100
 distract, that that person is not, not feel laziness. Always they are excited with the

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:37.900
 continuity to maintain that quality of the compassion and the emptiness together. Therefore,

00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:46.620
 they have continuation, uninterrupted, joyful efforts, all the community. When you have that

00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:54.620
 realization, understanding of that, we don't see it. Emotions are not disturbed. Therefore,

00:27:54.620 --> 00:28:02.300
 they have always, the beyond paramata, concentration paramata, all continuing paramatas.

00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:09.180
 When you don't have any attachments, clingings to any subject and object,

00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:17.980
 they have the worst paramata all the time. So therefore, now all the sex paramata again

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:27.020
 comes within one single state of the union, of the emptiness and compassion. And that is

00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:34.380
 self-born, a wellness western in the Dokkiti. Dokkiti, that's what we also discussed the other day,

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:41.180
 kind of reminded, Dokkit, Chishin, Rupa Rila, encompassed all the paths and all the bhumi,

00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:48.620
 and all the fulfillment, all the results, we're not missing anything. We're really able to maintain

00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:57.980
 in our Rupa state, as an instructor or Chishin said, we maintain that, that we are maintaining

00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:06.940
 all practices. So therefore, this is again, this bodhicata, the union of the bodhicata,

00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:15.260
 again, this is the practicing bodhicata, is really the practicing of the very fundamental

00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:22.060
 of the Dokkiti meditation, and as well as all the teachings, it really captures that. So that is

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:22.860
 how

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:28.220
 it captures. And again, we go back to the fourth boneless. So the fourth boneless, first boneless

00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:35.580
 of the negative is compassion, loving kindness, as we joined in the prayers. May all beings,

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:46.700
 prefer, may all living beings have the happiness and the cause of happiness. So that is, may all

00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:54.380
 living beings have happiness and the cause of happiness. That is the important, post-omegradable,

00:29:54.380 --> 00:30:01.020
 post-omegradable loving kindness. And the second one is, of course, you all know,

00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:08.060
 is this compassion, and may all living beings prefer suffering and cause of suffering.

00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:16.140
 This cause of all living beings. Actually, also, if we can use another way to kind of,

00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:22.300
 in a way, if we look to another angle of this, this phrase, that also these points to our

00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:27.100
 religious praying, for example, for gracious teaching, Buddha's first teaching,

00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:35.180
 amodical noble truth, positive truth, true truth, what? Suffering truth, cause of suffering truth.

00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:42.620
 Cause of suffering truth, and suffering truth. Cause the prayer for all may living beings'

00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:49.260
 happiness, cause happiness, that's the pacifically we pray, every living beings are free from

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:56.940
 suffering, suffering truth. Suffering, every living beings is free from suffering. Second, this one

00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:56.940
,

00:30:57.740 --> 00:31:05.340
 may all living beings have great faith, may all living beings are free from the cause of suffering

00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:14.860
 truth and suffering truth. Did I mess it up? Something? Maybe I messed it up. First one is,

00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:21.980
 may all living beings have the happiness, cause of happiness. That is the post-less love,

00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:30.460
 post-less love. And that is highlighted indirectly, may all living beings are free from suffering

00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:38.860
 truth, suffering truth. Second is, may all living beings are free from the suffering, cause of

00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:49.100
 suffering truth. That is also indirectly, we pray, all living beings are free from the suffering,

00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:56.060
 cause of suffering truth. So why pray that we are eliminating, bring poor, among the poor,

00:31:56.060 --> 00:32:04.700
 noble truth, positive truth, really we are taskforming into the worship and the compassion today.

00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:10.300
 So that. And then third part of it is the continuity, same thing, is greater joy,

00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:19.420
 boneless joy or immigrable joy. And that is, may all living beings never suffer from

00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:26.940
 supreme happiness, which is without suffering. It's union of the compassion and wisdom of

00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:27.740
 compassion

00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:36.060
 and love. And fourth one is the equanimity. It's balance. They are all living with the

00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:44.940
 great understanding. Perfectly means equanimity, free from both attachment and to the close ones,

00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:50.380
 rejection to the others, all the teachings. But ultimately, it's called the Dzokilayo,

00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:56.220
 this is the other, going beyond that. We go beyond that. That is the Rupa status.

00:32:56.220 --> 00:33:05.980
 Rupa, relational Rupa status. All this love in the comparison, joy arises from the Rupa.

00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:12.700
 The absolute nature of the mind is really arising. And it's settled in that status.

00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:19.500
 That is the great equanimity, not just at the conception level, equanimity, but it's the

00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:26.460
 equanimity, realization of exactly true nature. That moment will be merging samsara, nirvana,

00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:33.980
 in the same status. Same nature, same status. Whether it's the competition, whether it's the

00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:40.380
 loving kind, whether it's the joy and the appreciation, where it came from. It came from Rupa.

00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:47.820
 Eminently from Rupa. It's the display of the Rupa. And it's ornament of the Rupa.

00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:55.980
 As like in the teaching mission, the tides and the waves and the ripples are part of the ocean.

00:33:57.180 --> 00:34:04.060
 Tides and the waves and the ripples of the ocean is not separate from the ocean. It's all.

00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:11.980
 Whether that's happening or all that is happening on the, that ripples in tides and waves. It's

00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:20.460
 within the ocean. And it went back. Ocean. It came from ocean. It happened in the ocean. It went

00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:26.620
 back to the ocean. It never lost its quality. The ocean is the water, whatever that is.

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:36.300
 Same thing. All this display of love and compassion. And joy. Everything you all

00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:43.340
 project to all the same things is arising from our Rupa states. Rupa states.

00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:53.340
 And so, however, at a relative level, we should activate our great compassion with love and

00:34:53.340 --> 00:35:00.620
 compassion and joy and everything. Exactly really that is same thing. And activating that is so

00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:07.580
 powerful. So tremendously beneficial and powerful that. So that those, we don't understand it. And

00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:13.500
 then we also practice it. Every time you mean we look at meditation, practice, every second,

00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:18.540
 we can activate it. As I said earlier, you all know, and we have heard so many times,

00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:23.900
 it's not the first time we talk of it. But activating our practice, and then it really

00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:32.540
 addresses ourselves. So grounded and so strong. And our understanding and our confidence

00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:38.540
 has become so uncheckable, uncheckable. We're not disturbed by all the obstacles of different

00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:45.340
 emotions. Doubt and hesitation and skeptical, these and that thing. Those are the obstacles.

00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:52.460
 Those are the robles of the virtues. Doubt and hesitation and skeptical. And all those things,

00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:59.660
 the ones we settled, our practice, we should be strong, be confirmed, and stay with that and

00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:06.380
 cheat the goal for the goal. Activate that. That is. So those are with those.
