00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440
 All kind of any of, any thought, but be embracing this nature. Be embracing that nature with full

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.960
 of confidence.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:17.410
 Confidence and courage, fearlessness and state. We contain intellectual thought, upper world, all

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.000
 different, whatever we can think, we can think.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.440
 But this time, for half an hour or 20 minutes, 50 minutes, be in that state. Those are known as

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.000
 stable meditation.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.540
 Not disturbed by the intellectual or the consumption force. Then if we have that, then we can

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:42.000
 receive, also all other people, all blessings are very beautiful, so be really in that state.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.900
 And now, also as you are Buddha Akshobhya state, or Akshobhya, and the teacher is also known as the

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.000
 Buddha Akshobhyas.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.550
 And this as we teach and we are as Akshobhyas, not just only that, but whole universal world is

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.000
 transformed at the pure land of the Buddha Akshobhyas.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:19.340
 And known as Mompargava. Mompargava is an extremely delighting pure land. That's what pure land of

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.000
 the Buddha Akshobhya is.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:30.570
 So it really is purely delighted and completely utterly joyful in pure land. Utterly joyful in pure

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.000
 land. That is the pure land of the Buddha Akshobhyas.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.300
 We see that whole universe now transformed in that pure land. And not just the whole universe, but

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:45.000
 whole inhabitants already transformed in that pure natural state.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.610
 So have that very kind of expanded fearlessness realization in meditation with that, and then you

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.000
 receive this empowerment.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 And well, our teacher is going to perform the ceremony of a Chinese priest.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.940
 At that time, you can also visualize, well, the teacher, or when I will use some of these ritual

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.000
 objects and drums that we use,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.420
 at that time you can meditate from the heart center of the teacher, and as well as the speech

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.000
 center and the Quran chakra emanated and lightest to every different direction.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.910
 It was all the blessings of the Buddha's bodies and every enlightened beings, particularly Buddha

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.000
 Akshobhyas blessings, pure land of the Buddha Akshobhyas blessings.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.540
 And all that comes with forms or the form of the Buddha Akshobhyas, and big and small size, and the

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:41.000
 mantra of the Buddha Akshobhyas, and the ritual object, what's the mind of the Buddha Akshobhyas?

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.030
 All syllables such as White Aung, Red Aung, Blue Aung, they are coming as enlightening, or they are

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.000
 coming as showering, big and small size.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 They enter to your three places, and which is forehead, speech center, and heart chakras.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 And the particular heart chakra is completely absorbed.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 That moment, then our meditation becomes even more strong and more powerful, glorified.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.020
 We are completely in the earthly state of the great love and the compassion of wisdom and the great

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.000
 happiness.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 Very delightful, happy, quickly joyful status.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 Really feel that, a blissful status.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 Well, I'm doing those prayers and particularly using those drums.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.810
 So that is what our meditation, with that meditation, and then receive the whole empowerment around

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.000
, upon others.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 And the empowerment is the, you know, the empowerment of the three major states.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 The major body of, empowerment of the Buddha Akshobhyas.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 Major speech, empowerment of the Buddha Akshobhyas.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 The major words remind, empowerment of the Buddha Akshobhyas.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 Those are the three empowerment of the Buddha Akshobhyas.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.930
 Okay, so please, now I'm going to chime what I said to you at this recipient world of the Gopiya

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.000
 Masambhava,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 and Kirtan Sahaja Jamsi, and as well as the worlds of the great master Jammu Kundal,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 and first Chinti, their worlds, Amcha, reading.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 And this means also this world of the Gopiya Masambhava, Hishim Sahaja, and then at Vadashyamuni.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 So this is the blessed world that I'm chime in.
