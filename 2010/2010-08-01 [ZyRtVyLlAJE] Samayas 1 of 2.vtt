00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 Many times the teaching said, "Oh, I heard that term from other teachers and they said that."

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 Because many times what I heard is to do with samayas and this small connection.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 Very generally the teacher and the student have in the Dharma, they have really strong connections.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 This connection is not just samsara connection, but this connection or this relationship.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.270
 This relationship is spiritual, dharma. Dharma is not just for a short time, for a few hours or a

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.000
 few months in the year.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.680
 When you connect with that, really you are connected to all the way to the more like me, like with

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.000
 that opposite.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.800
 From now on, when you are particular, that is generally there. But particularly in the Vedayana

00:00:50.800 --> 00:01:00.000
 teaching, when you enter the medallā as together, and share the same medallā,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 same samaya, same substances and same video, same goal, and that is unity.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 That you are holding some of the beautiful sphere of unity of the divine medallā.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 When you see the samaya conduct of that, that means you are doing that medallā.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 You are making some shaking of that medallā, and you are putting strings on that divine medallā.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:45.240
 Therefore, in the teaching, it affects the definition of the teacher, because the teacher is

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.000
 playing the principal role of that medallā and that connection.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:01.820
 And then if you read the text, I think not even. The words of my perfect teacher, those many great

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.000
 masters who can do so many great things.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.870
 But when the samaya related things happened, it really almost like pulled down there from the sky

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.000
 to the ground.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:25.370
 That making for those reasons they send the song, "I have no any obstacles or opponents except the

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.000
 samaya broadcast."

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:37.290
 So in that case, of course, it affected the teacher, and then also definitely it affected strongly

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.000
 those individualism.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 For those restores, that is really important. Of course, we have missed this many times.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 This is our duality, and our habitual patterns happen.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.210
 But once we recognize that, once we see this, then try to cleanse and purify that with medicinal

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:59.000
 practices.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 All meditation, zōki meditation is always in the teaching.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 You say, "How important?" If you purify those things, then you clean.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 If you keep that, even if you don't do that, then it becomes more of a stain.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 And then when it becomes more of a stain, then it is difficult.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 Even the highest, the strongest detergent is having difficulty to take out the stain.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:37.600
 And that is how this, if we keep long time, then the teaching says it is not good. It says, "Long

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.000
 scar."

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 Scar is not good for the individual. So, that's it.
