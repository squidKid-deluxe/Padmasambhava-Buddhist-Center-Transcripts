00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.260
 Deep in our thoughts, this teaching is the teaching of the lineage, the teaching of the wisdom, and

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.000
 the compassion of the lineage teacher.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 Therefore devotion is honoring, respecting, and at the same time, gradually receiving that.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 Therefore this prayer is so special, so beautiful.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 And due those prayers, we devote it to the thought, as the teaching said, strongly feel great, joy.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.310
 And this is also practice, it's not practice of sad and suffering and frightening and threatening

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:43.000
 things.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 It is celebration of joy, appreciation, what we are, what we have, what we got.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.310
 That is what practice, and making beauty ourself, one of the beautiful glowing ourself, that we can

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.000
 glow now and glow continually to the future.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 Future, that is what I bought in practice.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.770
 And then to the joy, and appreciation, all those beautiful instructions, it is so special, all this

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.000
, this, to those thoughts, and then meditate.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.210
 Then meditate with those tiny information, and merge as in the teachings, and merge everything into

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.000
 the one single state of the old mind.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.030
 Even the joy and appreciation, all that, with the kind of looks laid out, but it's all generated,

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.000
 reflected, emanated from your Buddha mind.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.210
 This is the display of the Dharmakaya call, in some of the call, it went out and brought all

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.000
 everything beautiful and blended that in.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 And now we merge it back to our own awareness state, chikurupa, or Dharmakaya mind state.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 And now we are going to behold Dharmakaya mind.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 And Dharmakaya mind, making so many times of teaching, there is nothing to see, nothing to hope,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 nothing to grasp.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:18.080
 Simply relax, relax and reflect, not too much, maybe reflect, relax, relax, relax on the Persian

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.000
 state, relax on the Persian state.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:30.600
 And don't try to be, let it be the, what's called, mindfulness, support the mindfulness so that we

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.000
 can stabilize.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 There is one great master, not one great master, I mean it is a great master, very low keeper, low

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 keeper.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 Merited, it's not master, it's a nonsense teaching song, but merited, good merited.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.770
 He said one time, I heard, that's talking that with some of those low key, good practitioners, they

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.000
 are talking, they are talking.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 But this master said, when you meditate, what do we need?

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 Stable mind, stabilize the mind. Stable meditate, he said.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 Aho means, aho means my brother, I think, is koloko, aho.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 First, the meditate is so important. Stable, stable, firmness of stable is so important.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 Once it's stable, then he said, aho, what is needs?

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 We need more, peaceful, calm. So it's not forceful, forceful, but calm needed.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 Then he said, in other words, we need so calm but need, need little clarity.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 So that means firm, peaceful or gentle, and clarity. That's what we really need.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 When we be holding the dharmakaya, that's what we need.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 Firm, gentle, and clarity.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 What also that means, actually, is this is the experience of speech.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 Experience, of course, all this experience, but this is very low key, unannounced, great master.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 Speech, its own experience. Firmness is very important.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 If it's not firm, then so many distractions, conceptions are disturbing our meditate continually.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.630
 There's so many thoughts that come from one after another, and even you hold, behold the dharmakaya

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:39.000
 mind.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 Every second, it's kind of blown away, all the turbulence of the conceptions.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 That's what the great master published when he said, in the 6th Psalm, what he said.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 He said, triple the balance, means that these deluded conceptions are roaring as like waves.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 Waves, like raging waves. What's called, sometimes in the floor, the ocean,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 today's ocean is calm, means less, less waves.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.760
 Today's ocean is very rough, and so this concerned, deluded, concerned, so loud that waves are so

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:18.000
 ripe,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 and then there's no stabilisation.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 Dharmakaya, beholding the dharmakaya, is instantly blown, instantly interrupted.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 Therefore, stabilisation, firmness is so important.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 But then, this again, this second, what he said, gentle.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 Many times, the meditators will make so much effort, become so tense, so tense, so effort,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 and that is almost a really kind of system, this balance of this, mostly kind of lost system.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 So big effort, forceful and tight, that is not here. Relax, gentle, calm, the standard.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 Standard is there, calm and gentle and peaceful. That is what we need.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 So for that reason, this great practice he said, the gentle is important.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 It is too much gentle, and too stable, it is too much gentle.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 Then what is the brace? Then it brings dowsiness.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 Then it brings dullness.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 Then it kind of leads that meditation in almost a kind of ignorant status, dullness status.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 For that reason, this experience master or practitioner says, let it cloud it.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 Have you put a letter at clarity, to the gentle, to the threat?

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 Then, behold the dharmakaya, that is what the dharmakaya is.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 Then, dharmakaya is firm, dharmakaya is gentle, and dharmakaya is clarity.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 And that is what we need to state.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 And for that reason here, great master, also his Holy Spirit here said,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 having thus cut the problem, we did all the doubt and misconception about the will.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 The will continuity is called meditation.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 If apart from this, all marriages we target are intellectual meditation.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 Devised by the thought, we do not like that.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 Without the strain from the firmness of the will, we remain free,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 releasing all the perceptions of the five senses,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 draw in their natural status.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 Do not meditate thinking, or do not think that I am meditating.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:06.000
 This is it. Have you meditated with this?

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 This is it. Have you meditated?

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 That is the intellect.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 Therefore, nothing should be meditated upon.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 Do not let yourself be distracted even for the instant.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 That means firmness, firmness.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 But that means also what we need.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 We need mindfulness in order to make the little white.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 But also not mindful too much.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 That will again make too tense, tense.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 If you wonder at the Diwali, in the Ewali itself, that is really...

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:57.000
 So therefore, here I mean...

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
 So when we meditate, relaxing that natural status.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
 We are thinking we are going to meditate with this and that.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:11.000
 Thinking, that is as the teaching said, that is intellectual meditation.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 That is thinking meditation.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 Thinking meditation is conceptual.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 Therefore, this time we are going to release the conceptual.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 For that reason, we are going to continually beholden our will of Dhanakaya

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 and stay in that status, stay in that status.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 Not thinking, this and that, but relax and be in that prison status, prison status.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 And relax all the senses.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 So therefore, we are not going to follow any image or the message that comes from the senses.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 Anything there.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
 And we could follow in that.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:05.000
 Then it is destructed from the prison state of the view of the Dhanakaya mind.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000
 And for that reason, we relax in the natural status.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
 As thought comes, we are not going to block the senses too.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 No.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 As sense comes, we let it come, let it go.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
 As is coming, add let it go.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 That is known as then liberating instantly.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 Liberating instantly is all natural status.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000
 Status.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000
 So this is the again, this is the way we are going to meditate.
