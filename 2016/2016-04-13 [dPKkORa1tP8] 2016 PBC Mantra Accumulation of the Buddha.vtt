NOTE     "synopsis": "2016 PBC Sangha Mantra Accumulation of the Buddha\n\nThis year Venerable Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche is requesting the International PBC sangha to accumulate the mantra of Buddha Shakyamuni at least through July 2016 during the Annual PSL Dzogchen Summer retreats.\n\nKhenpo Rinpoche says that as you recite this prayer feel the presence of the Buddha in the sky in front of you. He embodies all the buddhas and bodhisattvas of the three times. Visualize countless rainbow-colored lights emanating from his body, which instantly touch and bless all beings, completely healing all physical and mental disturbances, bringing peace, happiness, and enlightenment to everyone. Bring up compassion and love for all beings including those close to you, and sincerely wish that they all enjoy happy and healthy long lives, all of their obstacles are removed, all their wishes for happiness and peace are fulfilled, that their realization increases, and that everyone quickly achieves enlightenment. Also pray for the long and healthy lives of all the lineage masters and world peacemakers, and that all of their wishes are quickly and perfectly fulfilled.\n\nRecite the mantra of the Buddha with devotion while wisdom rainbow light rays continuously stream out from his heart center in every direction. The light rays then return back to Buddha who blesses you. He then dissolves into a sphere of light which enters your crown and merges into your heart center. Then remain in meditation, abiding in the true nature for as long as you have time for. Conclude by dedicating the merit to all beings.\n\nEnter your mantras here: www.padmasambhava.org/mantra_accum.php",

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 [ Inaudible ]

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.720
 >> Just to announce something, some-- or do you pray or accumulate in the mantras.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:18.040
 And every year we had a great opportunity to announce and encourage you

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.080
 to accumulate in the mantras and one after another.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.680
 Every year we did and this year also we like to ask you to everyone here

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:35.120
 and everywhere we have some connections to really and to all our Sangha members

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.920
 and the friends of the Pemasumabuddhi centers.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:45.920
 And also as anyone who like to join these waves of the beautiful positive energy

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.320
 with the Buddha thought and really involve the power and the blessings

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:57.440
 of three duels in a reciting mantra and dedicated that to every levels in this life

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.840
 and other lives of-- after lives and as well enlightenment.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.440
 And then also in this life to our family, ourselves, our family, friend,

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.400
 and all the things-- and then really we-- there is no more as I said before,

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.800
 no more wars, no more permanence, no more disease and sicknesses,

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.560
 no more all this curling and fighting that.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.560
 Everybody have some reason to understand the knowledge to respect each others

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.040
 and harmony and peace always.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.880
 Everyone want the happy, the joy and the peace that everybody really want.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.240
 Not just to stop praising, overpowering, that wants the idea to the others

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.280
 and then just disturbing the entire many beings.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:48.720
 Really it just becomes so much trouble to wish and we pray and a giant mantra

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.240
 and really kind of subside all that and bring genuine understand knowledge,

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.640
 calm or born in their heart and pray well and beautiful peace and harmony.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.720
 And then among all the Buddhas, there is-- we've done so many prayers

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.800
 and world power and bless of so many Buddhas, but this year we really thought

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.040
 to special pray to the Buddha Shakyamuni.

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:15.480
 He is one of the-- I mean great Buddhas of this eons and it's our Buddha

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.240
 and all these teachings, what we are practicing, what we learned,

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.120
 what we follow, whether it's the Theravada, whether it's Mahayana,

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:29.600
 whether it's Vighayana, although keep practicing, it's all come from Buddha.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.720
 Without the Buddha, there is no such great teachings

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.520
 that what we are following is welcome.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.000
 And what we have understand knowledge that we have,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.240
 I don't necessarily will have without the Buddha.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.240
 And our compassion and love that we have some decent respect

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.880
 to every living beings, without I think Buddha,

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.800
 I don't necessarily will have this.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.080
 And for that reason, great Master Muharmadhi said here

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.920
 in his very famous Buddha teaching, teaching said, in the idea series,

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.520
 this, and in this land, in this time of the triple game,

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.320
 whatever life remains is your enlightenment activities.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.680
 Therefore to you as only Rapu [assumed spelling]

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.000
 and scream, and that's true.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.240
 It's all his teachings that we know this great teacher,

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.000
 we won't have all this knowledge and understand what we're learning.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.480
 And so we really wish and pray.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.080
 And a more powerful bless, Buddha, Buddha.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.800
 And Buddha is also known as the great compassion.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.920
 One accepted this true village, the general world,

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.800
 met 500 aspiration, praise, praise, his praise, the white laurels.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.800
 Among all the 1,000 Buddhas of every, Buddhas

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.160
 of every direction, praise to this Buddha, the Buddha Chapter.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.360
 So really in all the power and blessings of the Buddha and Jain,

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.960
 the mantra, and dedicated that merit to every beings.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.880
 So I'd like to, I mean, we'd like to encourage you all

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.600
 to do this academic mantra as much as we can.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.800
 And then we will announce that as again in this summertime.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.520

 In order to train myself to follow them,

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:42.720
 I dedicate all these merits for the happiness of sentient beings.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.720

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.720
 Buddhas and their sons and daughters,

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:50.720
 their deeds, aspirations, wisdom and passion and power,

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:54.720
 which are the illusory manifestations of the supreme wisdom.

00:08:54.720 --> 00:09:14.720
 Likewise, may all sentient beings attain their same state.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.720
 Thank you.

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:18.720

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:19.720
 So that's it.

 How many of you are here?

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:24.720
 We've done one more.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.720
 At least the stepping stones.

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:34.720
 At least I can let the mantras.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:53.720
 Oh!
