# Padmasambhava Buddhist Center Transcripts

All videos on the Padmasambhava Buddhist Center's [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@PBCInternational) up to 2025-06-07 have been transcribed using the OpenAI Whisper model `small.en`.

The YouTube descriptions were provided to Claude 3.5 Haiku with instructions to create a prompt for Whisper. Whisper was also informed that the primary speaker has a strong Tibetan accent. The teachings are primarily by Venerable Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche, and the content is predominantly Dzogchen in the Nyingma tradition.

Your help is needed to review and refine these transcriptions; please contribute by making a pull request.
