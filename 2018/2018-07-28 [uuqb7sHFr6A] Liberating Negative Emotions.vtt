00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.240
 One of the issues that many of us face is the arising of afflicted emotions. It seems you've been

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.000
 addressing that to some degree.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:22.180
 Have you a suggestion for how to intervene when we feel the emotion arising so that we can cut it

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.000
 and let it go?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 And that is when we are practicing Dzogchen Meditation, or according to Dzogchen Meditation, then

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 just this is everything.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 There is nothing more needed than liberating what the Dzogchen teaching means.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.940
 Liberating that. Liberating that means with the emotions arising, that any emotions arising, look

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.000
 to that emotion by yourself.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 Look to that and look at what this emotion is, where it comes from.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.380
 When you ask that simple two questions, or one question, that moment, emotion, whatever that

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.000
 consumption is liberated.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 There is nothing substantially existing there.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 And with that, then you apply some degree of those devotions and bodhicata.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.500
 Those are generally the Mahayana teaching, and also the Dzogchen teaching, so those will help with

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.000
 that.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 And first, when you do this Dzogchen level, this is the best.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:40.860
 It's instantly liberated, and even though it comes back, but it lost some strength of the emotions

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.000
 of the first.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.840
 First, it becomes 100% power with power, and when you do that, it will last maybe at least 10, 15,

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.000
 20 persons, lost strength.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.050
 Then, maybe you can use other techniques, such as Mahayana techniques, bodhicata, loving-kind to

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.000
 compare.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 When emotion comes, there is always some object.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.140
 Emotions, or in the teachings, imagine that the emotions, or the positive thought, or negative

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.000
 thought, when we have, mostly it really comes.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.110
 Actually, it all comes with external, some object, or external, or something, due to the inner

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.000
 tension.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 It comes as something cause, cause.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.500
 So therefore, most of the time, it may be caused by some individuals, caused by some beings, and so

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.000
 on.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 So, that is happening, and they really like both each other, both each other.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.800
 And then, what the great Mahatma Shanti Deva said, "All this happening is that what they are doing

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.000
 is, because they are not trying, because they are so smart."

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:54.290
 Smart. This is happening because they are, they are also completely intoxicated by that dull or the

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.000
 ignorance, darknesses.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 And then, maybe that will be a gentle ego clinging, and that's not how that happens.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 So, this fundamentally is the ignorance, that is ego clinging.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 Ego clinging is a mistake. Again, it is not, you know, developed by the dualities.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 Dualities. So, it is really, it will do to them.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 This happens all, this is by the ignorance, therefore, I am not going to too much upset with that,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 and I am going to be more convinced, and more practiced, and to dedicate it to everyone,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 to don the life of the wisdom in their heart and mind.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 So, they also were not going to mistakes, mistakes that were also,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 generally, it will also damage themselves to you.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 It is not something going, or is in one way, it comes back both ways.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 So, it was not good. So, thinking of that is then kind of emotional, radical.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 And then also, maybe apply the zogic technique, sub-liberating thing,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 the kind of alternating those things, diagonal fold.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 It will really help, reduce, to take care of that.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 But the best one is really zogic. That's what here is it.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 They told them that liberating with confidence, competent with confidence on the womb,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 and then liberated. That's it.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 There is nothing substantial solid existing. I am not letting go.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 If you do that, that is called fearless yogini,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 yogini with zokimoo, taking care of the situations.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 Thank you.
