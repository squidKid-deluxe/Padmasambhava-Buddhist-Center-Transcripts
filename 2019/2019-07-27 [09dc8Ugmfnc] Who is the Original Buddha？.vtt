00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
 Each of our Ruqala is an ordinary Buddha. It is the first Buddha, that means. It is the first

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.000
 Buddha before any Buddhas.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 This is the first Buddha. Why is it called a Buddha? It is totally enlightened.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 Totally enlightened. Free from all the obscurations. Free from all the negativities.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.470
 All the College of Enlightenment, whatever you explain, whatever you read in the book, Buddha

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.000
 teaching, is all within this Ruqala.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 So that means, all the mistakes and errors are totally free from this ordinary Buddha.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 And all the College of the Enlightenment is complete within that.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.160
 In the Tibetan teaching, or the Buddha's teaching, he always says, "Kyung, kun ses, kyung, ting, k

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.000
un ting."

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 It means, all the errors and mistakes, free from all the errors and mistakes.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 Now, all aspects of the good College are completed within this Ruqala.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 And therefore, it is enlightened. It is an ordinary Buddha.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 How is that Buddha? It is not just a Buddha. Buddha is the embodiment of three kyas.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 And you all know, dharmakaya, sambhokaya and namakayas.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 This Rupa is embodiment of three kyas.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 And what is in the Jokriti teaching pointed out, that emptiness aspect of Rupa is dharmakaya.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 Clarity aspect of Rupa is sambhokaya.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 The display of energy, energy arising, that aspect of namakayas.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 Reality level, all together, there is no difference between the three parts.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 That is our Rupa, your Rupa, my Rupa.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 So that three kyas of Buddha is right now, with us.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 Right now, with us.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 This is here, his own. This is the self-born awareness is.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 The self-born awareness is the Buddha.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 This is the Buddha. He pointed out right now.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 He is not saying that it will be Buddha. It was Buddha.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 He said, "Right now, this is the Buddha." That is Buddha.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 Believe it or not, that is what he is really teaching.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 And this is known as also the original dharmakaya.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 It never separated from us.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 Here is it. That is why it is never separated from us.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 But never separated, and even though never separated,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 but only we discover today, by the teaching of the Buddha Shakyamuni,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 Aumgara Bhamma Samhara, or Buddha Samhara, we discover.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 This is again, the great Master, Madhira.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 Madhira, the future Buddha, and also in his teaching, he used examples.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 How we are, we didn't see this. He used the examples.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 He said, for example, one poor man.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 A poor man, he is having so difficulties surviving for him to have food.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 Food, so poor. That is perfect.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 He is just showing everything, but even to eat, he is having all these troubles.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 And he is suffering.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 Pareto stays all the time, a long time.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 And one man there, he knows that all the karmalik, that was called...

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 What is called? The mining. He knows the skill of mining.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 The skill of mining.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 And we saw this poor is suffering so much with Pareto, Pareto, his soul.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 His soul, that man is underground.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 His house has big solid gold. Big solid gold.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 So now, he has big solid gold under his basement or bedroom.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 But he is, I don't know, he has many rooms, the bedroom, dining room, these little things.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 He is so poor, but just one room will stay.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 And he sees that. So now, I don't have to be suffering.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 There is such a big gold there, that gold.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 But however, even though he has that gold there,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 gold is not saying to that poor man, "Hey, I am here. Use me."

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 And also poor man don't know the gold. I have that gold.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 But once he has discovered that gold, that man knows, and now the other man says,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 "Oh, there is gold." And he started digging up that with effort, and got that,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 and bawling it, and began to use that.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 Then he is one of the richest, wealthiest persons.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 Then the same way, this tathanga, the Gharbha, the Buddha nature,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000
 Asalg-Bom, Ewens, Dharmakai, is never separated from us.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 They are separated from us, but we didn't discover it

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 until the gracious kindness, the convenient kisses of the Buddha.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 We never discovered it. It's helped.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 And when it is not discovered, we dilute it.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 We carry it by the force, and always looking something,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 and hoping something, hoping something, hoping something.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 We own it all, and not struggle with that.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
 Not achieving everything what we want.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 But now when we discover that.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 Now, therefore, here again, he said,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 "Reconize that right time, this time, when we have that opportunity."

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 And with great joy, great appreciation, great devotions,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 how fortunate I am, how grateful I am,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 gracious teacher, Buddha, and all those lineage masters, and lineage teachers,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 all lineage Sangha members, maintain the curve,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 this golden, natural-like teaching of love and kindness to completion visitors.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
 It's wonderful. Today, I'm reconnecting that teaching.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 With that, I discover my trails.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 How beautiful, how brave it is.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 With that. So, there, with that acknowledgement,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
 with that, also, it's a devotion to it.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 A devotion with both each other, and relax again.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 Relaxing that natural status.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 Status. And then, gradually,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 gradually, we will get that realization will come stronger and stronger.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 It will come with the state of the very stable status,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 or it will bring us to realization,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 then, truly, or to the ordinary natural status.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 And that comes gradually, gradually, here.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 Gradually. And when it comes, now, when it will come.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 But during that time,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
 during that time, how are we going to take care of that?

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 Whether it is during meditation or the course of meditation.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 Always, that we should hear again the next one,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 next line, and that's two lines, or maybe two, three.
