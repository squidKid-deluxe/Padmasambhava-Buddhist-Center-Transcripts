00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.280
 Thank you. Good evening, everyone. Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. Welcome. Thank you.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.960
 Thank you. Good evening.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:22.000
 Good evening. Again, I'd like to say good evening and welcome. And then, as well as, thank you for

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.880
 coming and

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:32.960
 participating with this, and also giving me this opportunity to talk about the ancient knowledges,

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:42.640
 the wisdom that used to be applied every day of life in the ancient time, and is continuing now

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:52.000
 in the East. And so the ancient knowledges are very beneficial, very practical, and is down to the

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:00.160
 earth. It's very beautiful, really. It brings a beautiful result in a life that what we like to be,

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:10.240
 what we like to have, at the same time, it will really achieve those beautiful results. So I'm

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:18.960
 so happy and so grateful with you all these evenings. Now, I talk really about what I'm

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:27.440
 going to talk about, mindfulness, and as well as meditation. I think that's what my topic is.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:35.760
 Generally, the knowledge that what I'm going to talk tonight is, as I already said, is ancient

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:43.200
 knowledge that's been practicing for centuries, from generation to generation. And this knowledge

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:54.000
 is never get out of debt. Debt is always so beneficial, and so powerful, and very effective

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:02.640
 and to bring meaning for our lives every time it is. And then when we talk, thinking of this

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:11.280
 generally, the situation in the modern times, modern time, there's so many material developments

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:19.600
 that we all know. Maybe one of the best material development in the human history. Ancient time,

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.590
 in a different literature, mentioned how beautiful, how good things that really mentioned this

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.840
 looks

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:33.600
 like so beautiful, so easy, so common, and everything comes so perfectly. No violence and

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.840
 violence and disturbance comes. So kind of beautiful that. But then most of the time

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:47.120
 in the human history, there's a lot of struggling and difficulties. And throughout the generations,

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:54.320
 we all human beings thinking that every have a lot of material development and progress,

00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:01.840
 we all think that really will bring the comfort in our lives, is our difficult troubles and joy and

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.680
 peace kind of good things to everyone. That's what we always thought, and not just only us,

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:14.800
 but throughout the generations when we read the history of the human. But however, this time,

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:23.920
 I think it also really tested that very much. We got, I think, the best development of the human

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:30.320
 world, every material things, all technologies, all the materials, and all the comforts of what

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:37.920
 we have now. It just can't be in a way in the enormous, unbelievable, in every somebody is

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:47.760
 telling the story of this now 21st century or 20th century situation or the development.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:54.960
 If somebody can tell that in 300 years ago, everybody will think it is just stories,

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:02.640
 it's mythological, it's not true, that cannot happen. But truly now is something unbelievable,

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:10.400
 unexpectable, that 200 years ago, this achieved in all these technologies, all this

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:19.520
 communist, as I said, you all know this. But however, how much that really happened to bring peace,

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:23.440
 happiness, and

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:34.080
 peaceful, and joy and comfort, how much it brings. That also we can, was not witnessed by,

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:42.880
 we can our own self. All the material things, what we do, we loved. More we developed, more we have

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.880
,

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:49.600
 looks like more needed, more needed, more needed. Mind is just a continuing kind of

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:55.680
 striving one after another, one after another. So reality of the peace and happiness,

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:03.200
 comfortable, every comparing this 21st century or 20th century happiness and peace and comfortable,

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:09.680
 and 300 years ago, peace and happiness, every compare. I don't know how much we can say this

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:16.800
 time is better than that time. It's just so many, and then because technology is developed so much,

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:25.600
 there is so many man-made sufferings. All over is happening and going, bubbling, it's just bubbling

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.600
.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:33.840
 And that, this material things developed, this did not helping to subside those things. In a way

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:34.400
 that

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:41.600
 this old man-made troubles are coming one after another. Another and some disturbance sometimes

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:47.520
 can't be loosely unbelievable how that can happen, how that can do. These kind of things happen,

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:55.200
 all this. So therefore, even though we have such a big development of the external material things,

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:02.080
 but reality level, what we are all looking forward, what we like to have in our lifetimes,

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:10.560
 we like to have peace, happiness, comfortable, more respect and appreciation to each other's

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:18.000
 and harmonious. Those are really we are looking forward, looking forward. Everybody want that,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:27.680
 everybody need that. So now we start thinking of how we could achieve such as these beautiful

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:34.400
 treasures that we are looking forward. Where is that going to come? Obviously, it's not coming

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:41.920
 from outside, from the materials too much. Maybe it's a little bit comfortable for a short time,

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:49.280
 but ultimately it's not just really doing anything. It's just, in a way, so much worries, so much

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:57.680
 anxieties, so much kind of fears, one after another, that continually happening, always happening.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:05.600
 And for that reason, what is really the solutions? What is the best? That is, I think, we apply the

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:12.320
 ancient knowledge and techniques, these modern times, it will bring the beautiful balance.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:19.920
 When we have this all the material developments, all this, but same time we bring this, this

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:26.880
 knowledge, beautiful skills, methods of the ancient time, they apply it. If we apply that,

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:33.280
 then I think life become more comfortable, peaceful. And we're talking about the ancient

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:41.680
 knowledge and the skills and techniques. Where does that come from? This is not coming from

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:50.240
 outside, ancient from those. Most of the time, if I talk, for example, the great teacher,

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:56.960
 wise teacher, the Buddha, what he taught, and then as well as many other great teachers,

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:03.440
 what they taught. It's all something connected with really our mind. It's not coming from outside,

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:13.280
 our sight. So something have to develop inwardly. And that is, then, with each of our own mind,

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:20.640
 how we take care of, how we like to be our future, and how like to be our self in the present time,

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:28.080
 is absolutely dependent how we're taking care of our self, particularly how we're taking care of

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:36.640
 our mind, our mind. Mind is the principle that ancient knowledge, every literature said,

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:44.640
 the mind is principle. But because why is the principle? Because it is rules, all our perceptions,

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:56.960
 all our conceptions, and all our feelings, mind is ruling everything. And mind is making the final

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:06.560
 decisions, what it will like to be pronounced by the mind. Therefore, taking care of the mind

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:14.880
 is so important. For those reasons, ancient time always spoke how important of the mindfulness.

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:22.960
 Because it is directly to the mind. These techniques of the mindfulness looks directly to

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:32.400
 the mind. Mind. But in time, as I said, mind is ruling all our perceptions, all our perceptions,

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:38.960
 all our feelings. That means mind is ruling all everything what we do.

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:47.920
 All that started from the mind, and ruling by the mind, and decided by mind. Where it is happening,

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:55.360
 now everything about self, always mind is looking outside. All the time is going out.

00:09:55.360 --> 00:10:02.480
 Every direction mind is going through every senses. We have five senses.

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:11.840
 Senses of eye, sense of the ear, sense of nose, sense of the tongue, and sense of the body.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:20.720
 Five senses, the mind is going every different directions. And then plus one more, called

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:28.160
 mind senses. Mind senses is ruling all the imagination worlds. It is ruling the past,

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:35.040
 it is ruling the present, it is ruling the future. So mind is the really ruler of everything.

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:44.800
 Where is ruling? Always looking out, looking out, following every message of the senses,

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:50.240
 whatever it brings, and distracted and carried by out, all the time out.

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:57.840
 Will that happen continually? How that happened? What we call normally, we are very distracted.

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:05.920
 We are distracted. We are completely lost. Then it brings so much what it brings,

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:12.720
 every kind of like, that all the messages coming from the different directions is clashing in the

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:19.520
 brains, one after another. It just is kind of like almost a criss-crossing, one after another,

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:27.200
 every direction. Then it creates worries, anxieties, sadnesses, and then maybe it will

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:33.920
 going to affect it to the psychological, mental problems, and then eventually physicals,

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:42.800
 that all lead by. Because mind is carried by external, it's just an over-scram, and wanting

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:49.840
 more and more, and that not happening every, even if we got those old things, it's not really

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:58.640
 benefiting to ourselves, to bring the peace and happiness and comfort. So that is what the code

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:05.840
 carried by the force of the mind, and looking external all the time. But mindfulness means

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:11.840
 something different, completely. It's about the mind, same thing. Mindfulness is mind.

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:22.800
 But mindfulness is looking inwardly, looking inwardly, and revealing the treasure, the goodness

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:32.880
 of the mind. Mind has so many good things that we all know. Joy, the appreciations,

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:44.080
 love and kindness, compassion, and then together with that, respect, appreciation, all that is

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:51.360
 mind, is treasure of the mind. According to the gracious teacher, Buddha said in his teachings,

00:12:51.360 --> 00:13:02.320
 said those are the natural quality of the mind. The joy, appreciation, love, kindness, compassion,

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:13.840
 the intelligence of the wisdom, the beautiful common senses, those are basic nature, basic goodness

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:25.520
 of our own, this mind. So then, when we bring, when we look inwardly, bring up glorifying those,

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:34.080
 and polishing that, then what it does? That is known as mindfulness. We begin to settle you down

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:39.920
 on the ground where we really belong, where we are, not just always looking externally

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:49.120
 distracted. We begin to look ourself, start feeling the drift trigger, warmth of the quality of the

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:59.200
 mind can, mind can offer or mind has. That is joy, as I said. So I like to talk kind of three

00:13:59.200 --> 00:13:59.520
 things

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:07.840
 about these topics such as joy and appreciations, love and kindness, and compassion, compassion,

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:14.240
 because they are the treasure of the mind. When we are connected our mind with this

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:23.440
 treasure, truly we are perfectly straight of the mindfulness. We feel happy, we feel joy,

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:31.520
 we feel, we have everything enough. We don't feel kind of like missing something, wanting this and

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:38.400
 wanting that. Really we feel so rich. So we bring the richness of from our own

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:44.800
 drift trigger, that which is hiding behind the midst of this turbulence of the conception

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:50.720
 that kind of has distracted us outside. And we're mindful of this. We are again,

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:56.880
 we're looking to these qualities, not nice. And to breathe it, so therefore,

00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:05.600
 talk a little bit about now, talk about the joy and then the appreciations and as well as

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:12.880
 love and kindness and compassion. So to do this, first I'll talk a little bit about the joy.

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:21.440
 Now we have to, joy is a part of the nature of our mind. It is nature of the mind.

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:30.240
 We don't have to go and get joy from somewhere else. Even we got something, it's not going to walk.

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:40.000
 Therefore, reveal your joy from yourself. By who? We are going to reveal our joy.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:50.240
 We have the every opportunity, 100% opportunities to reveal our own joy. And we have the right to

00:15:50.240 --> 00:16:00.240
 reveal. In a way, nature is waiting us to reveal it is beautiful nature. Nature, it is waiting us.

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:07.680
 It is a long time we're looking outside all the time. Now the time we look inwardly.

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:14.640
 And I'm not saying we should not look outside. We can't look outside, but occasionally we should

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:21.120
 look inwardly. Bring more joy, more appreciation, reflect with the beauty of the what we have,

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:29.920
 already have, already what we are. This is the word, means joys. Bring all these beautiful things.

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:38.480
 And again, in the gracious teacher, the Buddha gives in his literature, in the books, always said,

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:48.400
 being as part of the human beings, our self is very special. It's not just to go insignificant

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:56.560
 or kind of just casual. Truly, being as human being itself is so special.

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:06.400
 And many times in the said, many ancient those great wise men said, to become as a beautiful

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:13.760
 human beings is not just a happen by itself. It has beautiful cause and condition, circumstances,

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:21.920
 and both as this beautiful perfect. So that means, even we don't see our cause and condition of the

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:28.160
 have this beautiful life and the beautiful this human being situation. But truly, we see good

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:36.470
 cause and conditions. We have, we can judge, we can deduct it, or we can impress how that really

00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:36.800
 has

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:42.560
 beautiful cause and the beautiful condition. That's the word of this situation. We see the present.

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:49.920
 Present can pronounce of the past roughly, even though past we don't see, since we don't have the

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:57.200
 knowledge, the penetrator of the past and the future. Future, but through the present, we can

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:57.760
 deduct,

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:06.800
 deduct. And therefore, we have the beautiful. And beautiful this person in the life and therefore,

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:13.760
 it's something we should be joyful. We should be happy what we have. Then not just we are only

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:14.080
 human

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:21.680
 beings, but we are truly, so many luxuries surrendered to you all. All the freedom,

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:29.120
 favorable conditions, and as well as all the right freedom of right, so many things, one after

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:29.520
 another,

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:36.160
 you have. This country is one of the best countries have all those beautiful,

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:43.370
 lucky freedoms offered. And that is not just against freedom, not just a kind of, not just a kind

00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:43.520
 of

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:51.280
 casual. It is very special. It's really beautiful. And therefore, bring more joy and appreciation.

00:18:51.280 --> 00:19:00.080
 Then joy and appreciation is our families, friends. We all gathered together as, in a way,

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:07.760
 short time, one way. We look in our lives, how long we will stay together, in a way.

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:16.320
 And we kind of compare with the lives in a short time gathering. So family is our close friends,

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:24.560
 all those dear family members, friends who are with the together with us. Where we are together,

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:32.320
 where we are, be as together, we should be grateful, more joyful of that situation. Be kind,

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:39.120
 be nice to each other. We will be nice and kindness to each other. That is mindfulnesses.

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:48.720
 It brings the mind more gentle, more peaceful. It's more, more soothing, more calming.

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:55.120
 So bring more. That is what the joy is so important. Then there's also so many different

00:19:55.120 --> 00:20:02.000
 reasons to be individual levels. Really bring more joy and appreciation. When we have the joy,

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:10.720
 what is it like removing? What is wrong? All that kind of unfulf- kind of like, oh,

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:18.480
 I'm missing something, or not fulfilling, or something that un-uncorrect. All those really

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:26.640
 attitudes are kind of completely subside. Calm and brain, calm and peace, and it brings. So joy

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:33.200
 is so important. And that comes from our own heart, from our own nature of the mind.

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:41.280
 Then with the greater joy, we should also bring more respect and appreciation. More respect and

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:48.560
 appreciation. And that is also, really we need a respect and appreciation. So many people, and so

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:56.640
 many kind of men met, while this is going on in the world, why is it happening? In a way,

00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:03.200
 they are not really respecting the appreciation too much to each other. And kind of controlled by

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:10.240
 emotions, and then disrespectful. And kind of ignoring that existing of everyone. Therefore,

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:17.520
 respect and appreciation. What we have, what you have, and what they have. All is so important,

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:26.080
 everyone. Everyone is important to our own existence. And because we are here, because of them,

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:33.120
 because of others, we can enjoy and celebrate of our lives because of others.

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:42.000
 Our family, our friend, our neighbor, others. That's why we are making beautiful lives.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:48.720
 Therefore, respect and appreciation. We know the others. Our life will be lonely. Our life will be

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:57.250
 sad and completely kind of exhalated, as lonely as a tree in the desert, desert land, just a

00:21:57.250 --> 00:21:57.440
 company.

00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:04.160
 And because of others, we can learn so much. We can live up so much. We can make ourselves

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:11.920
 meaningful our lives. So therefore, others are so important, so precious for us. When we respect

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:18.800
 and appreciate it to that, what it does, again, our mind become more calm, more peaceful, more

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:26.800
 soothing. Then you begin to really see the beauty of not just only small area, but a wide range.

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:33.120
 We begin to feel that. How important, how beautiful, how special. Life is just beautiful,

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:39.440
 beautiful. This is whatever the time we have. We are a celebrator of this life in that context

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:46.800
 of joy and appreciation and respect and respect. That is what's so important, so

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:54.560
 so special. So this is the one of the powerful tools of the joy. And then to do ancient times,

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:59.760
 those in the books and the teachings, those practitioners really make it to meditate of the

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:07.440
 joy, joy and bring the joy in our heart and mind, kind of feel the joy in the heart and

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:14.480
 extend that energy to every living beings, to all everywhere. Just kind of extend it as a light of

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:22.560
 love and light of the joy, extend it to every different directions and let that joy, light of

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:31.440
 joy, touch to everywhere, kind of feel that and relax our mind in that status. That is known as

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:39.440
 meditating on the joy. Joy and then respect and appreciation come so beautifully, so naturally.

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:46.880
 So that is really about the joys. Then I talked about a little bit, I like to talk about really

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:57.530
 joy. Now we also bring more compassion. Compassion is again nature of our own mind. When we have

00:23:57.530 --> 00:23:57.680
 the

00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:05.760
 compassion in our heart and mind, what it does, it brings more calm and peace. Compassion is

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:11.760
 actually in the teaching always said, it is essence of the nature, nature of the mind,

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:19.200
 because it is really going to, when we have the compassion, we will underseed clearly

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:25.760
 situation of the old externally, outwardly and as well as our self, our own self.

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:34.240
 Compassion is wisdom, compassion is intelligence and compassion brings then peace and harmonious.

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:42.000
 And how is that going to happen? And we extend the compassion. Compassion is so important,

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:49.200
 but not just localized compassion. We really feel compassion to all, every living beings.

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:57.760
 Every living beings are wanting the same thing as our self. What we want, for example,

00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:05.280
 we like to be happy, we like to be peaceful, we like to be joyful, we like to have the performance.

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:14.160
 Every living beings wanting the same thing. There is no difference of anything. At the same time,

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:22.400
 also we have the same thing. What we don't want, we don't want sadness, suffering, difficulty,

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:29.200
 troubles. And every living beings also have the same thought. They don't want sad, they don't want

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:34.880
 suffering, they don't want uncomfortable, they like to have everything, beautiful fulfillment.

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:44.480
 So in the feeling level same, and physical level same, and mental level same, we don't have any

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:54.000
 difference. Yet, so many sentient beings, in one way, everyone is struggling, not fulfilling what

00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:01.840
 they want. And also what they have, they lose in that. Or troubles, difficult, one after another,

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:08.560
 really there's so many. And then in that old externally, and mentally they are also sad,

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:14.320
 and suffering, so many going kind of one after another. Therefore, feel great compassion.

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:22.640
 Compassion is a special power of the Mary, like medicine. That really is the troubles and

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:31.600
 sufferings of all others, and also one's own self. Therefore, compassion is the most powerful also.

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:38.750
 Powerful tools of the meditations. Meditation and a relaxed mind, and the essence of the mind

00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:39.200
fulness.

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:44.800
 So bring more compassion. When we have the compassion in love and kindness and heart,

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:52.240
 in mind, then it brings also respect and appreciation to the others. Respect and

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:57.520
 appreciation to each other, respect and appreciation to the environmental levels too,

00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:02.930
 when you have the compassion. Compassion. Because the compassion is not just localized one

00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:03.200
 direction,

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:09.760
 if we extend the compassion to the past, present, and the future, this is all about talking these

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:15.920
 modern times, or the scientists talking, these environmental levels. If we have the great

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:22.560
 compassion, we don't like to spoil our environment for now, and also for future generations.

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:32.080
 This future, our future is not ended right when we end it. There is ongoing futures,

00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:41.840
 ongoing beings, ongoing all the human beings, and we kind of don't have the respect and compassion

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:52.000
 to the environment. That means really we are also destroying the heart and the comfort of the

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:52.400
 future

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:59.440
 generations. Therefore, when the life of a compassion, then we kind of become very,

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:07.200
 what is that? Become self-important, self-centered mind. Then kind of spoil everything. Therefore,

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:13.840
 bring compassion. It's so important. Compassion is good for our own self, good for everyone,

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:20.560
 good for every level, everyone. Also known as the compassion is healing. When you have the

00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:27.440
 great compassion, it will heal our emotions, our scars, and also if we have some kind of

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:35.440
 different ideas between family members or friends, it is the compassion makes heal all those

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:36.000
 emotion

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:51.920
 the scars. Compassion also brings what's called apologies, excuses, and apologies, and excuse each

00:28:51.920 --> 00:29:02.720
 other, and apologies to each other. It really heals the scars. Therefore, compassion is so

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:11.120
 powerful, so important. Therefore, again, to do the compassion, and again in ancient those great

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:17.600
 teachings mentioned that kind of feel great compassion in the heart, and reach everyone

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:25.040
 really free from suffering difficulties and cause of suffering and difficulties. When the people

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:31.760
 experience the difficult troubles, this is not just happened by itself. It has cause, it has

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:44.560
 conditions. So we really wish and pray and putting energy forward to free or remove the cause and

00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:52.000
 condition of suffering and difficulties. For those reasons, even you can see a word kind of like

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:59.600
 some sentences say, "May everyone is free from suffering and cause of suffering." Cause of

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:09.440
 suffering can really sincerely mind with that statement and the knowledge and extend that to

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:17.750
 every direction to all the everyone. That is known as powerful meditation of compassion, and

00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:18.800
 powerful

00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:26.480
 meditation of the mindfulness. You're reflecting your mind with compassion and relaxing in that

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:34.640
 natural state. This compassion has no pathialities, no any kind of restructuring, spreading out to

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:42.560
 every direction, as like sunlight in the morning, just every direction. Really feel that compassion

00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:42.560
.

00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:48.960
 And we do this one time, two times, even a hard time, a hard moment, always in those great

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:57.120
 teachings and masters. It has so much power, so much healing energies. It really is it.

00:30:57.120 --> 00:31:06.560
 It clears away our obstacles and obstacles of our directions and brings the goodness and just

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:14.800
 brings calm and peaceful. And mind begin to settle calm and relaxing. It is on that natural status.

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:23.520
 So therefore, compassion is so important. It is the nature of our mind. When we are compassion,

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:29.200
 we are with the nature of the mind. We're relaxing. It is not just an artificial,

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:36.240
 created surface of the mind. It's a deep call of the mind. And we really bring up that call of this

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:36.480
.

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:42.640
 It is powerful. The next one, then, is really about loving kindness.

00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:50.880
 Generally, loving kindness, again, compassion, they are all the nature of the mind, this beautiful

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:57.760
 nature. And that means love is not coming from outside. Compassion is not coming outside

00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:04.880
 ultimately. It is within. And joy is not coming from out. Ultimately, within yourself, your brain

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:13.760
 out. Let them shine outwardly. Shine in that. So compassion and loving kindness, joys, all

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:20.560
 beautiful richness called to the mind. Now, loving kindness and compassion, generally,

00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:26.480
 they are very similar. What is the difference between these two? Principle one, love means

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:34.960
 that we see the importance and the beauty of everyone's. See the good things. Therefore,

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:44.960
 called love. Love is beauty. Love is special. Love is, again, the triggers. But it's beauty.

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:54.880
 It is very uplifting, loving kindness. Compassion is, again, the beauty of the natural state of the

00:32:54.880 --> 00:33:02.320
 mind. But it is going to rescue, support, helping those loved ones who are having difficulty

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:10.480
 troubles. So it is a rescue, kind of like tools of the mind when loved one is having difficulty,

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:15.680
 troubles, troubles. So that is really the distinction between love and compassion.

00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:23.600
 Generally, both are very, very similar now. Love is, again, why we need this love. Love is

00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:30.640
 so important, as I already said before, earlier. Because our living beings,

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:38.320
 every living beings are so special, so beautiful, so beautiful. Everyone is like jewel, really

00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:39.200
 jewel.

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:48.320
 Everyone is knowledge for us. All is so precious to each other. As I said earlier,

00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:55.840
 with all the others, we won't be survived. We won't be hidden. And we will not going to learn

00:33:55.840 --> 00:34:04.240
 anything. And therefore, this everyone is so important and so precious. For that reason,

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:11.520
 we need love. Love is, again, when we have the true love in our heart and mind, what comes?

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:20.480
 It brings calm and peace and harmonious in our mind. And we see, really everything, we see the

00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:28.960
 beauty of their knowledge, their natures. Natures. This love, again, is not just, as I said,

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:37.600
 selected guru, but to everyone. Really shine that love to everyone as a glowing light to

00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:45.760
 every living beings. And that we, every living being, have the joy, peace, happiness, make that

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:53.360
 last forever, ever, all the time. We think that sincerely from heart and mind, mind to everyone,

00:34:53.360 --> 00:35:01.760
 that this is known as love. Love is, as I said, is very special status of the mind.

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:09.840
 And we should always ignite that qualities in our heart and mind. When we have the love,

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:17.200
 then what comes? Also, courage and commitment, confidence, all those beautiful knowledges,

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:23.680
 beautiful qualities of the mind are really coming. And I say that, for that reason, this love and

00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:32.880
 compassion is so special and so beautiful. And that is what is the bodily nature of our minds.

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:40.480
 To agree with this, to preserve this now, to preserve joy and appreciation, and as well as

00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:46.640
 loving kindness and compassion, what we need, what we do. Again, special tool of the mind.

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:56.320
 That is known as courage and commitment and acknowledgement. That is what really we need,

00:35:56.320 --> 00:36:04.320
 we need. Courage and commitment, we need because, again, to preserve the love and compassion, joy,

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:11.040
 joy. Joy is not always sometimes easy due to our habit dependence. We have so many kinds of

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:18.000
 habit dependence and always looking outside and to distract ourselves and distract it. For that

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:26.800
 reason, we need great courage and commitment to preserve these good things. And also, we need to

00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:36.000
 remind ourselves how beautiful, how important that is to us, each other, and to be existing that.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:43.600
 So reminding to each other, and as well as also to kind of reflecting of that beautiful qualities

00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:51.600
 of our beauty, such as love, compassion, and joy, and appreciation. When we do those things,

00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:59.360
 then that is known as mindfulness. Mindfulness, generally what that also means, remembering what

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:06.480
 is good. What is good for us. That is really the mindfulness one way. And that is to bring what is

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:16.000
 good for us is loving kindness, compassion, joy, as I said, and the appreciation, and to preserve

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:22.400
 that with courage and commitment and confidence. That is what we really need. So therefore,

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:29.360
 remind to ourselves. When we remind to ourselves, when we are able to do that, when we are doing

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:39.680
 that, what is said? We should always acknowledge that to ourselves. Kind of acknowledge it, "Oh,

00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:47.440
 I'm doing good. I did good. I will do continue." Kind of acknowledge that to one's own self,

00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:53.760
 even no one is acknowledging that, but we should acknowledge to ourselves when we do the good

00:37:53.760 --> 00:38:00.160
 things, when is good performance, when our kind of all these beautiful triggers are revealing one

00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:07.200
 up another, we should really appreciate and being grateful, being grateful, grateful, and

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:07.840
 acknowledge

00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:15.760
 that. That is not known as then. Preserve that with courage and commitment. So through this,

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:24.560
 then we really do it with known as mindfulness practices. I will become more calm and peaceful,

00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:32.480
 and also when we reflect those triggers, what it brings? Then it brings more kind of sensibles,

00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:40.160
 more common senses. At the same time, we got more awareness so that we cannot not go in the kind of

00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:47.920
 spoil our beautiful situation in time, time for small reasons. Many times we do that

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:55.680
 with kind of thinking, picking up small things so much, and we spoil big things. That happened

00:38:55.680 --> 00:39:05.920
 by ourselves because of the mindfulness and not recognizing how good we are, how beautiful

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:13.120
 triggers what we have, and therefore kind of like recognizing, acknowledging, and appreciating,

00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:20.160
 and reaffirming our courage and commitment to preserve beautiful those triggers of love and

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:28.560
 compassion and joy and appreciations. If we do that, then truly we are really spending this our

00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:36.560
 life with very beautiful and very comfortably and with meaningful of that. And along with that,

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:42.160
 and then those people who like to do formal meditation, meditation, have all those

00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:48.080
 beautiful thoughts, beautiful those mindful triggers, joy and appreciation, kindness and

00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:55.360
 compassion, all those beautiful things. It just really reveals that nature even for five minutes.

00:39:55.360 --> 00:40:03.520
 Bring up those. Not let that hide behind all the turbulence of the day, kind of like those

00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:11.440
 Brazilian thoughts. Really bring more joy, more love, more compassion, and somehow it's not coming

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:19.440
 easily. Make reason. You have every reason to feel the joy and the appreciators. You have every

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:25.920
 reason to bring loving kindness in our heart and mind. We have every reason to feel the compassion,

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:32.480
 compassion, everybody. So bring out that instead of wondering all the time unnecessarily emotion

00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:37.840
 one after another. Where those emotions are coming? Those are unnecessary, unhealthy,

00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:44.050
 unkindly like healthy to our self, also disturbance to the other. Where that coming from? It's

00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:44.480
 through

00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:53.440
 our mind. So why we are following every time with that? That is unhealthy. That is disturbances.

00:40:53.440 --> 00:41:03.120
 Since we love our own self, why we should not bring our treasure of joy, appreciation, respect,

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:12.840
 feel richness. Create a sweet home as your heaven. You don't have to expect heaven in the future.

00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:12.880
 Of

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:20.240
 course we can expect future heaven too. But let heaven begin right now with your own home,

00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:28.480
 each our self. Bring more love, kindness, compassion, joy, and appreciation for even five minutes,

00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:35.520
 ten minutes. That is powerful way of the meditation of the mindfulness. Mindfulness.

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:44.000
 Then after that, if you like to do more conformal ways, meditations, that is the most simple one,

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:50.800
 more simple one is breathing meditation. Meditation means what? In the Tibetan world,

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:57.760
 it's gone. Gone means relaxing on the natural states. Meditation is not something kind of like

00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:07.760
 dogma or some traditions. Meditation is relaxing mind. Relaxing mind is nothing bound by any

00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:16.000
 traditions. Relaxing mind is not bound by any tradition, any schools. It's our mind, relaxing.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:23.360
 That is meditation. Meditation. So way to do meditation says why we use the breathing?

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:31.280
 Because of breathing time, our mind is so busy. It's never rest. That you know. I'm not

00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:40.080
 talking to story of the past. We look to ourselves how our mind is busy. The morning we wake up,

00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:48.960
 our mind is carried by so many conceptions. Until even when we go to bed or until we fall

00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:57.040
 sleep. Then before sleep, deep sleep, then you can't stop short time. But after right

00:42:57.040 --> 00:43:09.720
 sleep, then dream. Dream. So mind is busy all the time. It has no habit or no tradition of relaxing

00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:09.920
.

00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:17.040
 It just went so much all the time. When it's going out, where it's going? Busy. It's going out all

00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:23.600
 the time. Everywhere, the world of emotions, world of busyness, world of the worries,

00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:29.200
 anxieties. It's just going out, out, out, out all the time.

00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:40.400
 So meditation means relaxing. To do relaxing, our mind cannot relax easily. For that reason,

00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:50.800
 18 times those great teachers, and particularly Buddha taught, used breathing meditation. That

00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:58.880
 means mind is now following with breathing. Breathing. And just follow the mind with breathing.

00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:05.360
 Nothing changes about the breathing of the movement of the breathing. Relax our body,

00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:12.480
 relaxing our system and muscle, everything. Now just breathing in and out from the nostrils.

00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:21.760
 And just concentrating mind with breathing. And what is concentrated? When breathing goes out,

00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:29.760
 exhale, you see breathing is going out. When breathing comes in, you see coming in.

00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:37.040
 So follow the exhale, inhale, exactly as it is. We follow that five or ten times.

00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:45.520
 That is known as breathing meditation or relaxing mind with breathing. And also,

00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:54.000
 it has a reason to breathe. Why concentrate on breathing? Generally, according again in Buddhism

00:44:54.000 --> 00:45:01.840
 and as well as ancient knowledge, always breathing of the wind and mind has so much relationships.

00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:10.320
 Mind and the wind of our breathing just always almost together, always together. It goes

00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:19.040
 together, together. So therefore, every kind of use the breathing as support of the concentrate

00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:27.120
 on relaxing our mind, that immediately well also relaxing the mind and breathing and also our wind

00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:35.840
 becomes relaxing. Wind and breathing mind relaxes and that is then become meditation. So that is

00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:42.880
 really very very effective form and very powerful tool to relax the mind with that. And do that if

00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:52.000
 you like to do for five minutes or ten times. Going in and out breathing as one time and maybe

00:45:52.000 --> 00:46:00.960
 ten times. Or going out as one, coming in as one. That means exhale, inhale, exhale, inhale,

00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:08.960
 even count that for five times or ten times. Are we able to relax your mind that much with that

00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:16.080
 what we are concentrating. That what it brings calm, peaceful, soothing. That means with that

00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:24.960
 moment what is happening. All the energies are relaxing. Mind is relaxing, energy is relaxing,

00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:32.400
 muscles are relaxing and the system is relaxing and balanced. Then whole system of the physical

00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:41.360
 become quite calm, quite peaceful. That's what it's called meditation. Calm meditations. So that

00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:48.160
 that again start this is when we do that. This is known as the performed techniques of the

00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:55.520
 mindful meditation. Mindful techniques. It really what brings, it brings awareness. It brings more

00:46:55.520 --> 00:47:00.800
 understanding. It brings kind of the whole awareness. Bringing our knowledge is like kind

00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:07.920
 of like mostly like kind of one directed. But our mind is relaxed and then it will kind of expand

00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:13.520
 the knowledge and understand. It shines so clearly, beautifully and then it brings the

00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:20.240
 beautiful nature to call it one after another. So those are known as the practices of the

00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:27.120
 mindfulness and the meditation. And that is my brief talk for this evening. If you have any

00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:31.600
 questions, I'm happy to discuss it. Thank everyone again.

00:47:57.120 --> 00:48:21.510
 Oh yeah. Thank you. Thank you. That's better than this. Maybe you can say it right. It's back to

00:48:21.510 --> 00:48:26.800
 you. Thanks. Wow. That's so good.

00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:36.480
 I thought I lost it. Oh, thank you.

00:48:54.480 --> 00:49:04.160
 Please. I'm ready. I'm ready. No, no, no. Don't say it, ma'am. Please.

00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:22.160
 Well, Rinpoche, we want to thank you so much for your kind words of wisdom. The ancient wisdom

00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:29.040
 of mindfulness and the teachings of the Buddha that you and Ken Rinpoche have brought to us

00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:35.920
 for so many years here in the Palm Beaches. I was thinking about it the other day that

00:49:35.920 --> 00:50:02.000
 this is the 34th year that you have been coming. But you have come so steadfastly and with such

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:09.920
 devotion, Rinpoche, every year. And of course, you and Ken Rinpoche, our gracious teacher,

00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:19.440
 and your brother and your dearest friend who came and shared with us too until 2010. And

00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:26.400
 we're so grateful for your collective wisdom and for your carrying the torch forward.

00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:36.080
 And so it was in 1983 that Rinpoche's first came and planted these seeds of Dharma on

00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:45.440
 the shores of the Palm Beaches. And how the community, how this mindful and meditative

00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:55.360
 community has bloomed and grown. And we have a very active urban center in West Palm Beach

00:50:55.360 --> 00:51:05.120
 or in Lake Worth. And we offer practices now on Tuesday evenings and Wednesdays and Thursdays.

00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:13.120
 We have practice in Spanish. It's great to hear the heart sutra and practice the calm abiding

00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:20.240
 meditation in Spanish. We have practices on Saturday morning and once again on Sunday mornings

00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:29.200
 as well. And on Sundays the meditation and always what simple instruction that we can share with

00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:38.720
 people as well when they're new to our community. We also have a discussion group every Sunday.

00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:47.280
 We have fellowship and very lively discussion from Rinpoche's books. We've been working

00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:54.080
 most recently with a book, The Door to Inconceivable Wisdom and Compassion, written by our gracious

00:51:54.080 --> 00:52:03.120
 teachers. And the information is always so pertinent to our daily lives and uphold us.

00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:14.320
 And now we are looking forward to further development of these teachings of the Buddha

00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:22.960
 and the guidance of Rinpoche as we develop our retreat land that we have in Jupiter,

00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:31.680
 Florida, Palan Pima Samye Ling, or pardon me, Pima Samye Ling in Jupiter, where

00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:43.520
 we hope to continue to grow our practices there. We are in the process of raising funds so that

00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:53.520
 we can have a shrine there, a temple. It's on 10 acres of land and we held a beautiful practice

00:52:53.520 --> 00:53:01.520
 there yesterday honoring Buddha Shakyamuni. We sat by the pond and we listened to the wind and the

00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:11.120
 pine trees and saw the sandhill cranes fly overhead and call to each other and the hawks and the

00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:18.480
 turtles. It's really, it's such a very beautiful place and we hope that you will have the

00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:19.200
 opportunity

00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:27.600
 to come there and visit, to stay in touch with us. You can join on our mailing list. We have a

00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:38.080
 newsletter that goes out for the many activities and events that we hold. And so we want to

00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:38.720
 celebrate

00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:45.520
 that with you this evening as well as the stupa that we have outside. Perhaps you can see through

00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:52.640
 the window the stupa that's lit up outside. This represents the compassion of the Buddha.

00:53:52.640 --> 00:54:02.960
 It was a gift from Jeff Iber who's here visiting from Tennessee. It was a labor of love and he's

00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:11.360
 donating that to us so that we can have that on the new land at Pema Ling in Jupiter. And

00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:17.520
 so you'll have the opportunity this evening if you would like to light a candle for world peace.
