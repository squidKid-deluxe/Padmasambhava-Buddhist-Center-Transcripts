00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 We like to be bringing up to us, and even we don't like to make them ask that we like.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 So that's why it's a "magnetizing".

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 This of course, the Kurukulle practice,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 the other day the Buddha is all enlightened, all the same,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 but however, the Kurukulle is a very famous,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 he removes one of the important practices of the "magnetizing",

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 although of our practices.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 But many times, many great masters mentioned that,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 and of course, also as I said, it's true,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 one way could bring everyone into a kind of like, when we like to be,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 and those who we don't like, we don't like, or they don't like, make them like that.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 So instead of comparing the loving kindness and the harmony piece,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 that is the principle of the Kurukulle,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 all the inner practices with that, so bring that.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 But then more than that, many great masters often say that magnetizing, overpowering,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 immediately we shouldn't focus externally to bring something,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 but trying to focus more on our own perceptions.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 Our own perception is very difficult to overpower.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 Are we really able to overpower our own perceptions?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 That means our own thoughts, our own emotions,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 are we really able to overpower that?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 Then definitely we even don't have to try to overpower others to them.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 It naturally counts as overpowering them.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 So therefore, kind of, immediately when we see the wide running thought

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 and the conceptions and the emotions that are in it,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 immediately bring up the realization or the meditation of the Kurukulle

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 and through the comparison, the loving kindness, really our power that.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 That means, within the loving kindness, within the compassion,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 within the wisdom, it's overpowered in that.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 So that means what to do, as those thoughts, ideas, any thought comes,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 bring up trying to bring up more compassion, more love, and with the meditation of the Kurukull.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 So really we are overpowering of our conceptions and perceptions.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 And that really well then naturally is all power.
