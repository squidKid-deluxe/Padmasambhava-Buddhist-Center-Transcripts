00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720
 ...and appreciation and kindness and compassion is consideration, thinking to all the beings,

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:13.120
 that which again the greatest teacher, Buddha Shakyamuni, told. To think of all the beings,

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:20.480
 everyone is equal, same as in we. I want to be happy, they want to be happy. There's no one

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:27.120
 is don't like to be happy, and everyone likes to be happy in joy and peace, yet everyone is

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:35.920
 struggling, many different levels. Therefore, wish and pray, they all prefer their good thoughts,

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:42.000
 accord in the context of the joy, peace, and happiness, and they remove all those difficulty

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.880
 troubles and sufferings and whatever they're struggling, and wish this is what we really

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.640
 practice. So wish all of that, and not just only that that good things happen for a short time,

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:59.520
 but we wish and pray this will last a long time until everyone is rich in enlightenment.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:07.120
 Continue, keep, and have the great, joyful journey, and happiness journey,

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.320
 continue to one after another lives, until everyone rich after enlightenment. So,

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.680
 we can all those good thoughts, and practice, and live with power, and the blessings of the

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:24.960
 gurup and masambhava, lineage master's, and as well as the vedya sattva, truly it is marvelous.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.000
 It is very special. We are the one with also good beings, the lucky beings,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.280
 potent beings that can gather, talk there, and do these beautiful practices and connect

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.120
 to the true lineage teaching. It's not just for accidental, it is truly, it is blessed.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:46.720
 We all are blessed. We all have so many great masters received teaching one after another,

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:53.200
 but it is also time to put that practice, not just put in intellectual banks, or kind of side,

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.000
 oh this is another step, this is another step. This is the, then we start thinking,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.480
 then everything is another step. This one, this sun is a china is another step, and moon is a

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.760
 china is another thing. Sit up and stop, and then, then it's just what it does. It's devalue the

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:15.840
 freshness, call it this, and we become the disappointment. Once also become disappointment,

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:23.280
 and it's just satisfactory, and then we become as a lonely, dried tree in the desert, and then

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.480
 that's what becomes the end of life. That is not what we want. We want the richness of this, our

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.280
 life,

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:35.360
 joy and peace, happiness, and charity, our solid charity. Others is the true value of the human

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.560
 beings, and the true value and the qualities of the practicing of the Buddha, and Gautama sambhava.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.480
 So, therefore, on the rest of our goodness qualities of the practice that we receive,

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.480
 and then put that forward, and activate it, and then with all good things is something remarkable,

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:59.360
 and something very special. So, therefore, we should rest in it. Again, this is one of the very

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:06.880
 beautiful time to be practiced, and today is the new year, and we say goodbye to the year 2011

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:13.840
 with practice of the Vedya sambhava and Vedya kalaya, and today we are welcoming the year 2012

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.640
 with it, again, beautiful practice, the lineage of blessings of the Gautama sambhava,

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:24.160
 and the new one, and as well as the Vedya sambhava, and then Vedya kalaya is truly

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:30.720
 beautiful way to begin, and then I'm sure between that you saw the ball dropping last night. So,

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:37.200
 that is all good, start from good, and we did good, and we are concluding and preparing this

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.880
 something embarrassing, beautiful things to upcoming new year, and with these beautiful practices,

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.240
 and so again, this is something your joy, you work in bodhicata, and then we're going to practice

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:55.120
 Vedya sattva, vedya sattva, jamsak practice that we do, I think many of you already know, yesterday

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.480
 came, and I make it, and then practice Vedya kalaya, so it's wonderful to begin, and again,

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:06.480
 this is very special practice, but again, to make this special, what we need, we need

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:13.760
 our motivation, our intention, thought should match up with this practice, so this is full bloom,

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:20.960
 full, glorious practices to ask to the other beings, and that is what really we need. So,

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:27.200
 I just say this again, very friendly, reminding to all you, and thank you again,

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:35.760
 welcome everyone, thank you, thank you, thank you.
