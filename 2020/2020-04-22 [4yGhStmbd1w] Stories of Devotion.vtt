00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.370
 Thank you very much, everyone, for coming and participating and welcome again. Thank you very much,

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.100
 everyone.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:22.980
 Again, we're going to talk a little bit on the reminder of the teachings, the teachings of the

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:23.200
 Great Teacher,

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:30.200
 and therefore again we're going to strengthen our beautiful motivations.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:39.900
 Motivation of the joy and appreciation, and bodhicata, and then Vedayana teachings.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:47.210
 Motivation of other realizations of the three Vedas. Those are all motivations as much as we can

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.700
 activate it in our heart and mind.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:59.370
 And then we begin to reflect on our teachings. Then according to the teachings, it will come so

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:08.700
 beautifully and going to benefit ourselves as well as others to all other beings too.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.700
 So therefore, we're going to reflect those beautiful motivations.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:20.060
 And with that, and then again, we're going to talk, continue on the teachings of the, teachings of

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.700
 Bhai, the Great Teacher.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:33.560
 Japati Dhanurumu Ching, or His Holiness Dhanurumu Ching. And His teachings today, still we're going

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.700
 on the sixth, this line six, six.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:51.490
 And as I said many times, we're going this time, let it flow, let it detour, and exploring the deep

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.700
 meaning of each of these teachings, teachings and words.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:06.700
 This is all, of course, I'm going through all this, but reality, or that's all taught in reality,

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:14.700
 is all our practices, how we activate it, how we glorify our practices.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:24.120
 So our practice and our goal of the both each other will be smooth and more successful, and

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.700
 advancing, same time, every difficulty.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:36.370
 Tabolus came on the way of the practice, or during the practices, also how we can handle, how we

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.700
 can also let it go.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:48.580
 And so it's not just to perish it, or disturb our practices. So in a life, there is generally

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.700
 always a challenge.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:58.770
 Samsara has so many challenges, that we all know. Whether we are believers, or whether we are not

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.700
 believers, we all go through.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:12.700
 But that's not stopped, but our beautiful goals. We have to change that direction.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:21.740
 And for those reasons, those great masters of practicalism always mentioned everything used as a

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:29.700
 path of advancing, everything as advancing, everything is experiencing.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:36.730
 That means what? When you are experiencing, if it's good, we should be more advanced, more

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.700
 deepening, and more kind of activating it.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:50.700
 If it's not good, not a good experience, then we try to stop, or prevent it, avoid that.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:04:00.460
 That means life is learning. We are learning every time, actually. Even though we are out of school

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:07.700
, even when we are out of college, or we are professors, but still we are learning.

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:16.500
 We are exploring new things, bring more understanding. This time, Buddha teaching is the best upon

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.700
 completely teaching on the mind.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:30.700
 We are exploring that inner beauty, inner richness, and so detailed, so thorough, and so practical.

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:41.280
 And we explore the beauty, the richness of the mind, mind or inner, that surely will reflect to the

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:47.700
 body, activity of the body, activity of the world.

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:54.700
 And not just only that, it will also reflect teachings on our perceptions, our conceptions.

00:04:54.700 --> 00:05:04.290
 So then we begin to really, to smoothen and all the situations, circumstances, accord, or around us

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.700
.

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:09.700
 So those are really the reasons, where again, all this teaching is.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:16.700
 Now we talk about, we went quite a detour, and a thorough, and quite a deeper way.

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:22.440
 I mean, quite a, but still there are so many things to really to explain and go over all the things

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.700
, where we went, and now we are talking.

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:30.700
 Once you know the importance of the Buddha Dharma Sangha.

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:35.700
 Sangha, then we check the rafuddhi in the Buddhist self.

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:43.640
 The rafuddhi is ever used, the word, the kind of simple word, rafuddhi is closely connected to the

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.700
 Buddha Dharma Sangha.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:57.590
 Closely connected, because you know the importance and the benefits and the power of this contract

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:00.700
 to the Buddha Dharma Sangha.

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:06.700
 Therefore, then you will contract. So that is really, in a way, rafuddhi, rafuddhi.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:14.760
 So, what in the teaching said, and I said many times, rafuddhi is the foundation of all the

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.700
 Buddhist practices, Buddhism practices.

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:35.320
 But the foundation of rafuddhi is faid, F-A-I-T-H, faid, also can be translated as devotions. Faid

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.700
 are the devotions.

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:48.710
 Faid and devotions, generally, every spiritual community is always explaining the importance of the

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:49.700
 faid.

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:55.700
 Everyone, there is no difference between any schools and faid.

00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:07.120
 But in Buddhism, faid comes to develop within yourself. You know the meaning, the reason, the

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:13.700
 importance of it by yourself and develop that faid or the devotions.

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:24.260
 So therefore, Buddhism naturally devotions or the faid is developed by one's own choice. It's

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:32.700
 freedom. It's not pressured, not commonly distracted and forced to them.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:45.700
 It's your own genuine, interesting and desire by our own self, really clear mind, distinct in mind.

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:50.700
 That is the one really the faid is developed.

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:58.010
 Then in the teaching said, as he said yesterday, there is the cause of the faid, how to develop the

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:07.700
 faid, there is four different ways to develop the cause freely and openly in our heart.

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:18.700
 That was explained, kind of more clarified by the great master of Jumilungma, as he said.

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:25.700
 Those are, I listed yesterday, again, I will talk freely again, I will list again that.

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:38.070
 First is contracting with spiritual strength. Second is accompanying or associating with spiritual

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:39.700
 strength.

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:54.700
 Third is knowing the benefit and importance of the Buddha, Dharma, Sangha or above the Dharma.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:09:07.570
 And third is understanding or tired and bored with samsara. So those are the four different ways to

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:09.700
 develop the faid.

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:17.700
 It's not that means you have to have all of those to develop the faid. You can have any of those,

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:21.700
 well, ignite the outward faid in the heart.

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:31.040
 First is contracting with the spiritual strength. I am translating spiritual strength. Also it can

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:36.700
 be qualified teaching, contract with the qualified teacher.

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:44.280
 And see the qualified teachers, their practice, their meditation, their activity, something that

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:49.700
 you feel, oh, that's really nice and comfortable, beautiful, so you are inspired.

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:57.700
 Fundamentally you can survive by whatever the activities, so you are inspired. So that is one.

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:05.010
 And this is again in the teaching, there are many stories like this, this is how you survive, but

00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:08.700
 again in the Buddha teaching what is mentioned.

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:17.140
 During the Buddha's time, there are so many powerful kings. Of course, the Buddha himself is the

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:18.700
 prince of the kings.

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:26.010
 Prince of the kings. But very famous, also one of the very well-known kings, kings, is King Prasanj

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:26.700
eta.

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:30.700
 Prasanjeta, only to be translated as Yaposadhyas.

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:39.970
 Sargayama said, rule the kingdom of the Sharmasthas, that whole area is quite well-known, famous,

00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:43.700
 very civilized country at that time.

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:49.970
 But however, he was not really devoted to the Buddha at all, and of course at the beginning he didn

00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:51.700
't know the Buddhists.

00:10:51.700 --> 00:11:00.680
 But according to the teaching, his position is known as a tsozi, a japur, and he was quite inspired

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.700
 and devoted to the Buddha.

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:10.640
 So this position is visited to the King Sargayam or the King Prasanjeta and mentioned above the

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:11.700
 Buddha.

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:19.140
 Buddha and his disciples and conduct of the Buddha and activity of the Buddha were living how the

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:28.890
 story of the Buddha and then King Sargayam was inspired by the hearing the names of the Buddha or

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:30.700
 the story of the Buddha.

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:39.700
 And then after that, he became so devoted. King Sargayam became so devoted to the Buddha.

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:45.570
 So that is just really one of the examples of the story, but there are numbers I'm sure you

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:48.700
 encounter and we all counter in life.

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:53.700
 Many people are inspired by that and then they're involved in the practice of them.

00:11:53.700 --> 00:12:02.700
 So this is what like, in a way, contracting of the friend or the spiritual friends.

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:12.700
 And then second is, second or third one is knowing aboard the Buddha, Dharma, Sangha or the Buddha.

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:17.950
 And again, this is another, I mean, again, there is a menace, it happens, this is not just only one

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:22.700
 time death, but it happens famous or, for example, famous ones.

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:31.700
 Famous one is that, and in around, maybe in the fifth century or sixth century, around that time,

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:41.700
 there is very famous famous scholars known as Aishwarya Omati Chatter.

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:51.700
 And the teaching said he was so devoted to his parents, but parents and family are the non-Buddhist

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:52.700
,

00:12:52.700 --> 00:13:01.700
 one of the schools, so ancient, one of the Hindu schools. And he started, he learned all those

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:03.700
 philosophies of the non-Buddhist schools.

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:12.700
 He become the expert, but still he was so devoted to his parents, to his father, to his mother.

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:23.330
 Villages named him servant of father, servant of the mothers. Those are really named, devoted

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:26.700
 always in their services and the parents.

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:35.700
 And then later he become as like, pursued spiritual life and he become the well-known scholars,

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:41.700
 well-known scholars of the non-Buddhist schools or Hindus.

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:47.700
 At that time, Nalanda Monastery University was very famous, famous.

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:56.070
 So many people would say this sense is so great scholar, famous, his reputation is expanding and

00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:56.700
 glowing,

00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:04.880
 and many are important. You should go to Nalanda Monastery University, do the debate with those

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:08.700
 Buddhist scholars, Buddhist scholars.

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:18.120
 If you are able to win from the Nalanda Monastery University, then you will be the super of the

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:21.700
 super scholars, scholars.

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:29.700
 Because Nalanda Monastery University had so many great scholars, so many great scholars.

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:38.610
 And so, he thought that's a really good idea, I am going to go there. So, according to the teaching

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:43.700
, he went there, Nalanda Monastery University.

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:52.920
 And he said, he liked to debate. According to the teaching, according to his story, that time, Nal

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:54.700
anda Monastery University,

00:14:54.700 --> 00:15:00.700
 all those great masters are, in a way, retired, they are not in the monastery at that time.

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:07.090
 So, everybody thought, oh, this is really, we heard, he's so famous scholars, and how we can, who

00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:09.700
 can debate with this?

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:20.240
 This debate, who can debate with this? And then, we decided, oh, we should invite or call the Ary

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:20.700
adeva,

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:28.700
 who was the foremost disciple of the Nalarjuna. So, we should call him, call him.

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:36.270
 And so, there's kind of, again, the longest story, but my short one, the Aryadeva is one of the

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:40.700
 foremost disciples of the Nalarjuna,

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:52.700
 and he invited, he came. So, now, finally, they debated. Debated, and according to the teaching,

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:55.700
 Aryadeva was warned.

00:15:55.700 --> 00:16:01.270
 Worn, it is defeated. At the beginning, at that time, how they did the debate, according to the

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:02.700
 teaching, his story,

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:10.750
 at that time, when they made the debate, that means they're using their direct perception while in

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:12.700
 the cognitions,

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:20.700
 in the emperors while in the cognitions, and then, as, I mean, this true, most principle one,

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:28.920
 they're really using that and then debating, debating. So, therefore, whichever is accurate, then

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:29.700
 they make the agreement,

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:34.700
 at the beginning, whoever wins, and whoever makes the accuracy of the point,

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:40.700
 the point, and more meaningful, more tangible, with all that is contradicted by the direct

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:40.700
 perception

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:47.700
 while in the cognitions, as well as the emperors while in the cognitions, then we will follow.

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:57.100
 Whoever wins, we will have to follow to each other. We kept, that means, whichever won, the losers

00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:03.700
 will follow the winners' philosophy

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:10.700
 and their, whatever the practice is. So, that's what their agreement, and they debated.

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:19.700
 When they debated on Aria Deva, who won according to the teachings. And now, Aria Deva, when won,

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:21.700
 Aria Deva told,

00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:32.310
 "Now you should become my student at a trade refuge." But, Mati Chaturhata, or Ashuwagoja, don't

00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:34.700
 want a trade refuge.

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:43.610
 So, there, since he don't want a trade refuge immediately, or at that time, he don't want, they

00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:45.700
 kept him in the room,

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:54.700
 room where there's so many books, so many books. He was sitting in the room, there's so many books.

00:17:54.700 --> 00:18:02.700
 So now, he was kind of sitting in the room, and there's nothing much happening, so he started,

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:03.700
 really thought,

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:09.690
 "Maybe I'm going to read these books," whatever that was. So, he read these books, and when he

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:11.700
 started reading the books,

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:18.700
 he really saw beautiful points, one after another. It makes so senses, so beautiful.

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:27.700
 And then, he become so, because from that, he become so devoted to the Buddhism,

00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:34.700
 he become one of the great, again, scholars in Buddhism as Mati Chaturhata.

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:42.780
 Or Tukung Paoi to be translated to. That's what really teaching says. So, this is what, again,

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:45.700
 inspired by the reading,

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:55.500
 knowing the Buddha, Buddha, Dharma, Sangha. Then, he developed a strong connection, or to talk

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:56.700
 about this.

00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:02.700
 So, this is another story of that. Then, not just only that,

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:08.700
 I'll talk another story of this. Again, for example, Cai Chisung Dev Ji of Tibet,

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:18.700
 one of the most famous, powerful king in Central Asia, that time, in that century.

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:24.700
 And Cai Chisung Dev Ji was renowned as a nation of the magicians.

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:32.480
 But, when it was young, there is some Buddhist in the royal court, but it's not really popular at

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:32.700
 all.

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:39.700
 Buddhism is not popular at all in Tibet. So, the young Cai Chisung Dev Ji, the king,

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:49.700
 the young king, Chisung Dev Ji, was very, become curious to explore the meaning behind this prison,

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:55.700
 this open kind of life. Did he like to explore, not just the only kind of this life,

00:19:55.700 --> 00:20:02.750
 but then he like to explore something behind of this meaning of life, and like to know more about

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:03.700
 that.

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:09.700
 And also, something more than just the only kind of like, become only conquering, and fighting, and

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:09.700
 ruling,

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:15.700
 and then he like to explore a little more deeper, well in the meaning of life.

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:20.700
 So, he's very curious, he become kind of like searching, in a way, searching.

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:26.700
 At that time, Tibetan power is extending, his domain is extending.

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:34.700
 Almost all border countries of Tibet, that time, is Buddhism, whole Buddhism.

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:39.700
 So, there are so many Buddhist contracts, all those are generous, and those are all,

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:45.750
 generous for going to the border, and when they're coming back, and there's so many news about

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:46.700
 Buddhism,

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:56.260
 one after another, that. So, then, Chisung Dev Ji has become more, also interested to knowing about

00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:57.700
 Buddhism.

00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:05.700
 And around that time, then it was maybe around 16, 17, 18, around that time,

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:10.700
 this is one of the ministers, who are also traveling to different border areas,

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:18.700
 as like border guard, or the general, or the, there's going to be those areas,

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:26.700
 and he's very devoted to Buddhism. His name was something, something was very devoted to Buddhism.

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:32.150
 So, when came to Chisung Dev Ji's inquiry of the different spiritual, and particularly about

00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:32.700
 Buddhism,

00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:40.700
 he told all this young king, kind of, he's very smart, and very kind of, lecture, like lecture,

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:42.700
 young king.

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:47.700
 So, now, maybe I should show him some books, or books.

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:53.790
 So, he told, and then came, also asked, "Do you have any books or materials that show me about

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:54.700
 Buddhism?"

00:21:54.700 --> 00:22:05.240
 So, Sanning, the municipal Sanning, showed him the first suttara, known as suttara of the Ten Virt

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:05.700
ues.

00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:14.700
 So, he showed that Ten Virtues suttas. And King Chisung Dev Ji read that, read that,

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:18.700
 and he told, "Wow, this is really very good, logical," said that.

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:23.700
 And Ten Virtues, already we discussed that, Ten Virtues,

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:32.300
 three by the body, four by the speech, and three by the mind, and those make six, or sorry, ten

00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:33.700
 virtues.

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:36.700
 Give up, Joe, in a minute. Give up, Joe.

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:43.700
 And give up, Joe, is a void of ten known virtues, ten virtues of suffering.

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:51.700
 So, he told, it's really make logic, it's all kind of logic, it makes reasoning, it makes senses.

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:57.700
 So, he thought, he thought this conductor of this school, the Buddhist, is quite good.

00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:01.700
 "Then you have anything else? Show me all books about this."

00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:08.700
 So, he showed, sort of known as, green rice suttas.

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:12.700
 Rice suttas, sala yakum do, in Tibet.

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:15.700
 So, sala yakum do is green rice.

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:21.700
 He called the teaching, one time, Buddha is walking on the rice field,

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:27.700
 and the farmers are interested in the Buddhism, and the teaching from the Buddha is devoted,

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:35.700
 and the Buddha picked up handful of the green rice, or the unharvested rice,

00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:41.700
 picked up that, that, and then Buddha kind of started to give the teaching,

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:49.900
 teaching about cause and conditions, and interdependent systems, with that falling of the rice

00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:50.700
 grains.

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:52.700
 So, called, sala yakum do.

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:56.700
 So, Chaso Devi had now got that, and he read that.

00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:59.700
 Wow, this is really, he saw so nice.

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:04.700
 So nice, his conduct is real, and will is really quite good.

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:07.700
 So, he's also united, they're not separate like that.

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:09.700
 He thought it's wonderful.

00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:15.700
 And then, he can ask if you have any other kinds of books to show off.

00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:23.700
 And then, also, minister gave him to the diamond suttas, and he read diamond suttas.

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:27.700
 He thought, wow, this will is so good, perfectly.

00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:34.700
 So, conduct is good, and conduct is good, and will is good,

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:42.700
 and also practice is combination of the will and the conduct.

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:45.700
 So, it is really, meditation is so good.

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:51.700
 So, therefore, will, conduct, and meditation, all good.

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:58.700
 I like to explore this, and I like to invite these masters on these countries,

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:03.700
 and I like to give the gift of that to my 20 people.

00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:08.700
 Then, he really decided, he got a strong determination thought.

00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:12.700
 So, therefore, this is what, in this way, what we call,

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:18.700
 yesterday we said there is whole kind of faith, or three.

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:27.700
 Interesting faith, and desirable faith, and trust faith.

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:32.700
 So, just so deeply, develop those all three.

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:37.700
 Three, positive, of course, interesting faith.

00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:41.700
 Second is, then, desire.

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:46.700
 I like to know more about faith than trust faith.

00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:48.700
 He developed that.

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:51.700
 So, that's how it really all happened.

00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:58.700
 So, this is the little story of how those parents are developing.

00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:01.700
 Then, renunciation of the parents,

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:04.700
 all the knowing the world and the samsara,

00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:08.700
 with the samsara situation and circumstances,

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:13.700
 boiled, boiled, boiled, and tired.

00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:17.700
 B-O-R-E-G.

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:20.700
 B-A-R-E-G.

00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:22.700
 B-O-R-E-G.

00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:26.700
 B-O-R-E-G.

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:28.700
 So, I think, you know, bored.

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:33.700
 I'm bored and tired of when you say bored.

00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:37.700
 So, bored and tired, so many people in the Buddhist history,

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:41.700
 so many great masters, really tired and bored,

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:46.700
 bored and completely turned their mind to the Dharma.

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:51.700
 That is so many stories, and one of the big stories of the great master,

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:53.700
 Mola Redma too.

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:56.700
 He was tired. He was bored.

00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:59.700
 He was all those activities, what he did,

00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:04.700
 and also feel something new, kind of like, feel the resentment.

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:10.700
 And all that, then, he turned his mind and heart to the Dharma completely,

00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:14.700
 and then he gained the highest spiritual realization

00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:18.700
 within that, his life, within a short period of time.

00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:23.700
 So, this is what really that developed the pain

00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:29.700
 through the bold and tired of the samsaras.

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:32.700
 So, that is really about it.

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:35.700
 Then, when you develop those devotions or the pain,

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:40.700
 I say the interesting devotions or interesting pain,

00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:46.700
 and the desire pain, and the trusty pain, uncheckable pain.

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:50.700
 All of those, each of those are accorded teaching,

00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:53.700
 so powerful, each of those.

00:27:53.700 --> 00:28:00.700
 And I will tell a story of the interesting power of the interesting devotions.

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:04.700
 This, again, of course, has happened throughout all the generations,

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:07.700
 but this I'm talking about during the Buddha time,

00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:10.700
 what Buddha has talked about.

00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:18.700
 One time, Buddha and Ananda and his students are walking along the river

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:25.700
 to the city for lunch, lunch, and lunch.

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:30.700
 That means, in Buddhism, all those ancient monks and nuns,

00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:36.700
 traditionally, they go to the midday, or before the midday,

00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:46.700
 to the villages or the city, get food, or they receive the food, donations, food.

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:49.700
 And also, when they receive the food,

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:53.700
 they're not going to make the comment about the food.

00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:56.700
 Wherever, primarily, you go, if you receive the food,

00:28:56.700 --> 00:29:00.700
 that's it, you will receive the food,

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:06.700
 recklessly, with thankfully, joyfully receive the food,

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:11.700
 and then take that and eat that.

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:14.700
 Not going to make the commentaries of the food,

00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:18.700
 or say, "Oh, I want this, I don't want this," and that things.

00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:22.700
 Not also going from the house to house, trying to get more food, no?

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:25.700
 Accorded the teachings.

00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:29.700
 So, ancient time, that was the Buddha told.

00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:33.700
 And that's what asked the Buddha, told Buddha himself,

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:36.700
 doing that same thing.

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:43.700
 To all the students, they go to the tom, before the noon, receive the food.

00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:50.700
 So, they're now walking near the bank of the river.

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:57.700
 On the bank of the river, there are quite a few children playing the sand castles.

00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:04.700
 Sand castles, I think they call it, sand castles.

00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:11.700
 And some children are appointed as king,

00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:17.700
 others are named as ministers, others are named as subjectors,

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:22.700
 and they make sand castles, this is the palace, this is the treasure meter,

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:26.700
 and that is telly managers, and so forth, they really created their names,

00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:32.700
 and they're playing the dharma on the sand, that river banks.

00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:37.700
 Far away, Buddha and the students are coming.

00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:44.700
 Among that, one child, one boy, was so inspired by seeing the Buddha.

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:50.700
 He didn't know any rhythms or any things, but he was so inspired.

00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:55.700
 And he really liked it, because also that boy was acting as king,

00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:58.700
 among them, named as king.

00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:02.700
 So, he thought, I'm going to offer him by treasure department,

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:06.700
 I'm going to offer the treasure, the jewel.

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:15.700
 So, he told that his minister opened the door of the treasure store,

00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:20.700
 and he did that, and he took up the handful of the sand

00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:25.700
 from where they were named as treasure houses.

00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:30.700
 And he liked to put that in the Buddha's begging books, arms walls.

00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:34.700
 Buddha is according to teaching, he's a giant.

00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:38.700
 So, this young boy couldn't reach to the Buddha.

00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:42.700
 And he told this young boy to say to his minister,

00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:46.700
 you must lower your body, what's called, bend your body,

00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:52.700
 so that he can climb up his body and offer that.

00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:58.700
 And so, this minister, his minister, who was minister name,

00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:05.700
 and he bent his body, and this young boy who held the handful of sand

00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:10.700
 and going to put in the arms walls.

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:17.700
 So, he did that, and Buddha also graciously let it lower down his arms,

00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:27.700
 and then a young boy was able to put the handful of sand in the Buddha's begging walls.

00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:31.700
 He was so delighted and happy, he thought I did it so well.

00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:38.700
 I offered my jewels to this interesting individual or say it is.

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:43.700
 And Buddha said, give that to the sand or that dirt.

00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:47.700
 He said, keep this and put this around the stupas.

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:50.700
 And Buddha gave that to the ananda and asked him,

00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:53.700
 keep that and put it around the stupas.

00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:58.700
 And then Buddha said, in 100 years after my mother in Nirvana,

00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:02.700
 he will become the great kings

00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:07.700
 and build so many monuments of the Buddha everywhere.

00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:09.700
 That's what really he said.

00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:17.700
 So, this is what inspired faith, resolved with inspired faith,

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:19.700
 that he believed.

00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:21.700
 Then who was that king?

00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:24.700
 According to Buddhism, that was King Achok.

00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:31.700
 The greatest king, the historically great king and ruler of India,

00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:38.700
 who ruled majority part of the issues, even he didn't have to fight later.

00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:41.700
 He built up his arms.

00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:45.700
 He gave up his everything in the arms and he gave up weapons.

00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:50.700
 He promised, at the beginning of the time Achok was very vital and cruel.

00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:53.700
 But once he met the teaching and the Buddhism teaching

00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:56.700
 and his complete change in his mind,

00:33:56.700 --> 00:34:01.700
 he developed, as we're talking here, an unshakeable devotion

00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:03.700
 or the pay to the Buddhism.

00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:09.700
 And he gave up violence at all, all the violence activities.

00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:14.700
 And then he became the most religious spiritual king,

00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:17.700
 king in human historians.

00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:19.700
 Historians.

00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:22.700
 And he built so many monuments in India,

00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:26.700
 really throughout India and Nepal and all the border and hundreds,

00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:30.700
 because he conquered all those areas without fighting.

00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:33.700
 So many kings and all those kings.

00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:37.700
 Just his dominion, so easy, so confident.

00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:39.700
 And just they came.

00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:44.700
 So this is the story of King Achok, how he started that.

00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:48.700
 Because of his offerings.

00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:55.700
 The inspired devotion or pay that he met, this, this.

00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:57.700
 Then there's many other stories too.

00:34:57.700 --> 00:34:59.700
 I mean, you all know, I think many of you know,

00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:03.700
 you can see what Buddhism teaches, those pay.

00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:09.700
 Interesting generally, we are using as an interesting pay,

00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:15.700
 desired pay, and trusty pay, unshakeable pay.

00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:18.700
 Those are, say, kind of one after another,

00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:21.700
 but those are not just kind of like one,

00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:26.700
 develop them, and then it takes a long time to develop the next one.

00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:28.700
 It depends with the individualism.

00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:32.700
 Someone developed all that so soon, really so soon,

00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:35.700
 so quickly, so soon.

00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:38.700
 And sometimes, some individualism takes time,

00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:42.700
 comes here gradually, one after another there.

00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:47.700
 But it comes, and for example, those are so developed,

00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:51.700
 so fast and quickly, but of course,

00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:54.700
 now first he's kind of inspired yourself

00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:57.700
 by hearing the stories, hearing the names,

00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:01.700
 or hearing these gardeners of the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha.

00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:04.700
 And this is again, also my perfect teacher has that too.

00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:06.700
 I mean, you can read.

00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:10.700
 It's a kungun being in the center of it, in the kungun area.

00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:13.700
 There's one man called mungun, me.

00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:14.700
 Me.

00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:17.700
 And he heard a lot of good reputations.

00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:20.700
 They were the stage of the joar in the center debate.

00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:23.700
 He heard it so many times.

00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:25.700
 So he thought, I'm very interested.

00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:26.700
 I like to see.

00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:27.700
 I like to go see.

00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:29.700
 And so many of course, so many of course,

00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:33.700
 all that he thought, but he was very kind of like slow,

00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:35.700
 what's called slow mind.

00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:40.700
 Very orthodox slow mind. In the debate, we call it limba.

00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:42.700
 Limba is slow mind.

00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:45.700
 But limba is not the kind of limber.

00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:47.700
 Actually, in the debate and consumption,

00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:49.700
 they think limba is generally good,

00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:52.700
 because once they decide it, they're just so stable.

00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:53.700
 That's it.

00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:57.700
 Whatever they decide, that really stays so strong.

00:36:57.700 --> 00:37:01.700
 So they are like very, many times, limba are like golden.

00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:03.700
 They never change whatever.

00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:05.700
 They are just so strong.

00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:08.700
 So this kungunbi is a lima, lima man.

00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:12.700
 He is not so kind of like, so many thoughtful,

00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:15.700
 thinking, thoughts and consulsions, these and that things.

00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:19.700
 So he presents, he heard so many good things about joar.

00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:23.700
 He came to Lhasa, center debate, went to play Gremmish.

00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:25.700
 And of course, many of you know that.

00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:29.700
 That's all you read in the books of the Prophet's teachers,

00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:31.700
 all the other books.

00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:32.700
 So he came.

00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:35.700
 So when he came, it's kind of somehow, when he came,

00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:38.700
 there is no one in that room.

00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:40.700
 In the Gremmish temple.

00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:41.700
 There is no one.

00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:42.700
 So he came.

00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:45.700
 He looked at Gremmish, and it's very beautiful,

00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:47.700
 nice looking statues.

00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:51.700
 He told, he's really so nice and peaceful.

00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:54.700
 And then in front of there, so many like butter lamps.

00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:58.700
 And also there's so many kind of nice-looking dormas.

00:37:58.700 --> 00:37:59.700
 Dormas.

00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:04.700
 So he thought, wow, this is really cozy and so nice.

00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:07.700
 He told this, all these butter lamps,

00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:11.700
 ah, he has so many lamps because it keeps warm in the room.

00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:13.700
 Warm, so that.

00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:17.700
 And then also, there's so many food, all those dormas.

00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:19.700
 And there's a lot of food.

00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:21.700
 So he feels, I'm a little hungry.

00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:24.700
 I'm going to eat a little bit, a little bit of this food.

00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:26.700
 And I'm going to take this.

00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:28.700
 So he picked up some dormas.

00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:34.700
 And it dipped in the butter lamp oil, the oil, and he ate.

00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:35.700
 It's delicious.

00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:36.700
 It's delicious.

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:38.700
 [LAUGHTER]

00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:40.700
 Well, he's eating.

00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:43.700
 He looked up to the Gremmish stages.

00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:46.700
 Gremmish looks at the lady smiling.

00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:48.700
 And she said, wow, you're really good lama.

00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:50.700
 He said, you're really good lama.

00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:53.700
 I'm using your food and your food.

00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:54.700
 But still you're laughing.

00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:55.700
 You're smiling.

00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:56.700
 You're so good.

00:38:56.700 --> 00:38:57.700
 You're so good.

00:38:57.700 --> 00:39:00.700
 So now, April, he's filled with tummy, I believe.

00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:01.700
 So filled his tummy.

00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:04.700
 And he said, I'm going to go one--

00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:06.700
 a certain ambulance to you.

00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:08.700
 So I don't want to wear my shoes.

00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:10.700
 I'm going to go bare feet.

00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:13.700
 Feet, circle, and where do you keep my shoes?

00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:14.700
 Shoes.

00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:16.700
 So he left the shoes off.

00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:19.700
 And he left the shoe right in front of the dorm.

00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:21.700
 And then he went to a certain ambulance.

00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:23.700
 Went to a certain ambulance.

00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:28.700
 So during that time, the caretaker came.

00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:31.700
 And he thought, who did this?

00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:34.700
 This was believing that he had such shoes

00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:36.700
 in a temporary temple's rooms.

00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:38.700
 And he thought, turn, throw that.

00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:41.700
 And the teaching said, [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:44.700
 You spoke that time.

00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:46.700
 Don't throw that.

00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:47.700
 That must have asked me--

00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:48.700
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:49.700
 --ask me to keep this.

00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:51.700
 Don't throw that.

00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:53.700
 So then he came back.

00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:56.700
 And he said, you're really such a good lama, he said.

00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:58.700
 Again, he told him.

00:39:58.700 --> 00:39:59.700
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:01.700
 He never told his teachers.

00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:05.700
 He really told his living Buddha right there.

00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:06.700
 Right there.

00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:07.700
 He never.

00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:09.700
 So he said, you're a good lama.

00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:13.700
 I'd like to invite you to my home next year.

00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:17.700
 I will make my tradition the biggest arrangement to you.

00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:22.700
 And even I'm going to make nice [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:23.700
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:24.700
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:25.700
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:26.700
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:28.700
 So I have a big [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:31.700
 And with big [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:32.700
 So I'm waiting you.

00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:33.700
 You will come.

00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:34.700
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:37.700
 He also said, yes.

00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:38.700
 So then he went.

00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:41.700
 He went and returned back to his home.

00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:46.700
 And the village, he told his wife that I met very good lama

00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:47.700
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:50.700
 And he's so nice and old, he said stories.

00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:51.700
 And I invited him.

00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:52.700
 He says, he's coming.

00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:55.700
 So I don't know exactly that he will really come.

00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:57.700
 But he's supposed to come in one year.

00:40:57.700 --> 00:41:00.700
 So please, you should look when he comes.

00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:02.700
 We immediately have to invite him.

00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:06.700
 So then he really prepared all those food and chum.

00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:08.700
 The alcohol, they usually like that.

00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:12.700
 Sometimes it's actually like, keep the pork one year.

00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:15.700
 Those are known as the vintage alcohol, for example.

00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:18.700
 When the family member goes and they're traveling,

00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:20.700
 they make the chum.

00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:27.700
 Chum and then keep that chum alcohol, leave it like that.

00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:29.700
 For whole year, when they come back,

00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:33.700
 those family members come return back to home.

00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:36.700
 And then when they kind of open that chum and celebrate it.

00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:38.700
 So those are called [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:39.700
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:41.700
 And so I think he met that and prepared.

00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:44.700
 So according to his story and the teaching,

00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:47.700
 the [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] really came.

00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:49.700
 And the [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] that monument of the [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:53.200
 came is that blessed printed [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:57.700
 also in water as well as in a stone nearby the [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:41:57.700 --> 00:41:58.700
 house.

00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:01.700
 So this is what-- it is all [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:06.700
 of those three prepared, one up another, not immediately.

00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:08.700
 He had the interesting devotions.

00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:10.700
 And that's why he went.

00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:15.700
 But then that very desired devotion, our desire

00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:20.300
 of faith, and trusted faith, and inshakable faith,

00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:25.700
 all that developed during the process of where he is enjoying

00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:31.220
 the [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:32.980
 And then what is all?

00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:37.060
 He able to speak to [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:38.100
 Why?

00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:43.660
 Because his faith has devoted.

00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:45.380
 And that is a story.

00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:48.580
 There are so many stories that you know that really

00:42:48.580 --> 00:42:52.580
 purify the obscurations, obstacles,

00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:55.260
 and increase the merit.

00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:57.500
 They say the power of the mind, when

00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:02.940
 you open the door of the power of the mind, it is inconceivable.

00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:04.420
 It is so powerful.

00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:06.580
 That's what what I said.

00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:08.780
 Power of the mind is so--

00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:10.980
 that inconceivable.

00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:13.380
 And the material powers, they're exploring

00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:16.820
 by modern scientists, scientists really explore.

00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:19.500
 It's so powerful, so technological.

00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:20.140
 Look at this.

00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:23.860
 Now we are maybe physically distanced,

00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:27.660
 maybe many hundreds of miles.

00:43:27.660 --> 00:43:32.220
 But then, virtual reality, whatever this technology,

00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:38.700
 we are within one room, in a way, talking to each other.

00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:41.300
 And this is high text.

00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:45.100
 This is a material development.

00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:48.100
 But mental power developed.

00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:52.220
 That is-- according to Buddha's teaching,

00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:59.540
 it's trillion times more powerful than the material powers.

00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:03.420
 Maybe 500 years, 300 years, if somebody

00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:06.740
 tells the story of what happened in the 20th century,

00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:11.420
 the 21st century, nobody will believe.

00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:16.700
 Everyone will think this man or this little lady is Google.

00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:20.180
 Everybody will see that, truly that.

00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:24.900
 But now, reality is here, all this.

00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:28.340
 We are going in the sky with big house, eating, drinking,

00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:32.100
 talking, watching, like plants.

00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:37.860
 I mean, it's just like 300 years of this unbelievable status.

00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:41.900
 This is the power of the developed by materials.

00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:45.460
 But mental development.

00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:47.140
 Mind is already powerful.

00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:47.900
 We know.

00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:49.780
 Even we didn't develop it.

00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:53.660
 Even it's completely shielded with all the obscurities

00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:55.020
 according to Buddhism.

00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:57.420
 Yet, it's so powerful.

00:44:57.420 --> 00:45:00.500
 And everyone revere that goal and say,

00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:03.340
 in front of our player, wear that.

00:45:03.340 --> 00:45:07.900
 Then, this Buddha's goal, this power of the enlightened beings

00:45:07.900 --> 00:45:10.580
 is not mythological.

00:45:10.580 --> 00:45:16.180
 It is true stones, true evidence,

00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:20.540
 the flexible openness of nature.

00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:26.860
 When it's openness, it is then all that really you can see.

00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:34.180
 Then that's what said samsara is turning to the nirvana

00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:35.980
 or the pure levels.

00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:38.340
 These are not methodical stories.

00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:40.660
 Reality that we can do.

00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:43.060
 Those great masters did.

00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:44.740
 So that's my brief talk.

00:45:44.740 --> 00:45:47.820
 Again, it went a little longer by the stories and all that.

00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:48.580
 And thank you again.

00:45:48.580 --> 00:45:50.020
 OK, thank you.

00:45:50.020 --> 00:45:51.100
 And then see you tomorrow.

00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:51.820
 Thank you again.

00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:53.380
 We do your meditation.

00:45:57.420 --> 00:46:00.780
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
