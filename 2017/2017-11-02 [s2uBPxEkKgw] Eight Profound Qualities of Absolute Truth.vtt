00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.980
 The absolute nature, there is no difference between Mahayana teaching and Vaidhyana teaching and

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.000
 the Dzogki teaching.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 It's all the same. There's no difference.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 So therefore, again, same thing in the Dzogki teaching, same thing, same thing.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.150
 In the Dzogki teaching what? We'll say, all is in the wisdom status, in the Dharma Kaya status, Sam

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.000
bo Kaya status.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 And then Vaidhyana teaching, all these five highlights are like five Buddhas, five Buddhas.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.600
 And then also these five within the poem, all elements are there, four elements are within the poem

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.000
.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 Poem, so five pure Buddhas are there too, all these.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 In the same way, so with that understanding, now Chariputara, all Dharma, empty, empty.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.560
 Again, great master or great bodhisattva, Avaloktahara, or the greatest teacher, Buddha, re-emphas

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.000
izing of these.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 All phenomena is empty. Same way as I explained of the five Avaloktas, same way, how they are.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 All these following ten protonatophics, so not ten, eight protonatophics, those are for example.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 Emptiness is one, no character is one, and unborn is one, neither imperial nor imp...

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:56.570
 So from this, from emptiness to this, no increasing, increasing, up to that is known as five

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:02.000
 explaining of the quality of the great emptiness, of great nature.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.990
 That at the point of the protonas, at the point of the protonas, all is explaining, pointing out

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.000
 teaching of the great emptiness of nature, exactly natures.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 So all phenomena is also empty. Empty, up there, that already went.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.680
 And therefore, there is no characteristics, nothing. Characteristics is again easy, that means no

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.000
 characteristics of the inner emptiness.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 There is nothing characteristics, no characteristics.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 Characteristics is one, generally in the village level, each has characteristics.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:54.610
 What are the characteristics of the fire, the heart and the burning? What are the characteristics

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:00.000
 of the water, the moisture and the water?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.710
 And what are the characteristics of the earth, sahitoba, and the solid and the best, or the support

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.000
 of the best?

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 Those are the characteristics of each of the every head.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 But in the emptiness, there is no characteristics, no characteristics.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:30.630
 Any emptiness also there is no bone, what's called here, no, there are no, there are unknowns,

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.000
 unknowns.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 Because since everything is an emptiness, what is birth? What is birth?

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 This is not just also making rules and everything is empty.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 The reality level, if we look carefully on the relative point of view, what is really birth?

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 Birth, there is no single entity at the birth that produces the birth.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 When we see the birth, it has so many combinations of the sport.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 Sport, so it is the birth of the illusions, not the birth of the solid and the best.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:16.180
 It's illusion, all the supporters, each of those supporters are illusions, each of those supporters

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.000
 are not existence.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 And for those reasons, the greatest teachers are repeated, what are repeated in the teaching set.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:32.630
 And also one of the teaching, Mahayana Suttara, known as Luhiyayapur, a Madhya humanist, king of N

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.000
aga, known as Madhya Padma.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 He records the teaching and that Suttara is named after the Naga king, Madhya Padma.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 So Madhya Padma, Suttara, that which is caused by Madhya Padma.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:59.830
 In that, Suttara says, one said, things which is developed through the conditions is not the solid

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.000
 birth.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 Solid birth.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 So the abdication birth, that birth, is true.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:16.200
 Ab is born, birth that means is all illusion birth, which is in the Buddha's teaching name as inter

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.000
dependent coordination.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 It's supported so many objects that come together.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 Each of those entities are all illusions, all disciplines.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 And even the cause itself has so many things, what we call cause.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 It cannot be developed alone.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 It's all illusion birth.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 When the earth, the cause, and again seeds are like, how they are connected.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:55.000
 If you look carefully, according to the teaching, there is not really any, we can see solid answer.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:03.330
 The connection of the birth, its cause and its seeds is all magic, like illusion display, that

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:04.000
 thing.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 It's the same as our mind, how our mind is coming out from that emptiness.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 Emptiness, if we look carefully, it's just so mystery.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
 There is nothing that we can explain.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 Solid, that is reality as of this nature, all that.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 So therefore it's unbound.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 Since it's unbound, there is then unseasoned.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 Unseasoned.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 Unseasoned, what is season?

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 Let me see.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 So, emptiness has no birth and no seasons.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 And then, since this is unbound, there is nothing to impure.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 Nothing is impure.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 And since there is nothing impure, there is nothing to be purified, nor preformed purified.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 And also, this is never born or never unseasoned.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 There is nothing increased or nothing decreased.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 That is the absolute nature as it is.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 As it is.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 This is how it's called preformed topics of the explaining of the meaning of the absolute nature,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 or the great emptiness, exactly as it is.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.000
 This also can be summarized, this whole at-point, as three doors of liberation.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 I'm sure you heard, oh, and many of you, I know you heard this.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 These three doors are known as the door, the rightful three doors of the liberation.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 Because when you realize this nature, it will release us from the boundaries of the dualities.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
 So it will release us, liberated us.
