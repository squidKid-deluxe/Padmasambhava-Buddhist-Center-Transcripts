00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.540
 This most recent book of Venerable Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche, which was written with his

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.670
 brother Kenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche, this beautiful book "The Pointing Out of the Nature of Mind

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:22.620
," the Dzogchen Pith Instructions of Aro Yeshe Jungne, and from this book, so many people from these

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.000
 teachings obtained enlightenment from the very earliest of times.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.080
 And so Rinpoche's are making it available today that these teachings that came about in 10th

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:39.980
 century Tibet are once again available to people and here for us as Westerners to have the

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.000
 opportunity for these most precious teachings.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 We bow down to you Rinpoche, we are so grateful for you and for Venerable Khenchen Palden Sherab

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.150
 for bringing this forward to us. And the book is available now in our bookstore. We're the first

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.000
 people to have the opportunity to have this. It just came out.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.700
 I think this is the fourth new book of this year that there are, it's been a big year. And so we

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:12.000
 hope that if you wish to have the book signed today, Rinpoche, if you'd like to buy the book in the

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 books,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.270
 buy the book in the bookstore and bring it in, Rinpoche would be delighted to autograph it and

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.000
 offer you blessing. So, thank you.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.550
 Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. That's true. This is not, of course, to say that Kenji Bhaddishar

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:35.990
 Muti and myself, we wrote, and however, many Sangha members put so much great, joyful effort to

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.000
 come this book.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:46.320
 And then at so many purposes, really did so many works and editing and non-scraping, editing, and

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.000
 then make this, because I'm so thankful, so grateful to all the Sangha members.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.860
 Today is a very special day of Thanksgiving, and I have so many, many to thank you all, really, so

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.000
 many things.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.650
 And for example, this year I had this great, beautiful, my wrist and my knee, so I can stand tall

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.000
 and strong on my ground, on the ground.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.860
 And so many Sangha members everywhere, in particular, the West Palm Beach Sangha members, so kind,

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.000
 so supportive, so helpful.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.470
 So I thank you all, and really every support and kindness. And then as well as this booklet, this

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.000
 book, I mean, it's also came up.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.650
 I'd like to thank very much to Richard, Richard Strenberg. He put so much effort, this upper

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.000
 transcript by the many Sangha members.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:47.150
 And along with N.P. Matrapa and many other Sangha members put, and then Mark, Clinton, so I just

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.000
 thank you all.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 So many, and Theresa Cooper put so much also line drawings here, and all of them you will see.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 And this is one of the very special teachings of the Niung Ma schools of Tibera Buddhism.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:08.220
 Buddhism, as the curse said, it was started around 11 or the 10th century, end of 11th century and

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.000
 the beginning of 11th century.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.160
 One of the great Madoka masters in history, in Tibera, in his teachings, and then once again in 19

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.000
th century,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 the master's part of Rumba, he revitalized and then he activated that,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 and then K.G. Baddisharam would give these teachings.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 And then my son, five years ago, or six years ago, I don't remember, and I had great opportunity,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 the privilege to join with him as part of this, like, bring out this teaching at the beginning.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 So I'm so grateful to every aspect, and thank you all, and thank you very much again.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 Thank you.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 Thank you.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 Thank you again.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 Thank you.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 Thank you. Thank you.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.470
 This, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this,

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.000
 this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 First, first, people, one of our song members, she did this.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 So this is Aroishin Juni, and then this is all the, like, first students, they give the tickets,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 and that means students.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.320
 So those are kind of illustrations, and there's also beautiful illustrations of that, his life

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:27.000
 story, so that kind of how he came to the world, and the kind of those things here inside.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
