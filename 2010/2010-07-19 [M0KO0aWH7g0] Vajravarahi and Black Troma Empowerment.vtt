00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.220
 I am going to offer the empowerment of the Buddha Vaidyavarahi.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:14.600
 Vaidyavarahi according to the teachings of the great thetan Dunyung Mungpa or the Hsongs of Dunyung

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.240
 Mungpa,

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:27.470
 and as well as the great Thasung Mungpa's teachings according to the like exalic wish for the

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:28.700
 inspiration of our great teacher and Kintin Padma Samye Ling.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:39.950
 So in his memory and his honor and in his presence, I'm trying to do this phrase in order of this

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.720
 ceremony empowerment.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:49.960
 In order to begin this, of course, everybody, again, we should be strengthening our bodhicata

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:50.860
 intentions and beautiful motivation.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:58.690
 These two intentions often, I think everybody said so many times, this intention is the bodhicata

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:59.680
 intention,

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:06.720
 and as well as purity intentions of the purity, the understanding of the true nature, entire this

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.040
 universe as it exists.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:16.230
 So I'm just going to follow exactly as this teaching kind of roughly translated, and this is the

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:17.840
 words in a way,

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.920
 it's on a Dunyung Mungpa and as well as there's a lineage of masters. So here again, we should be

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.120
 strengthening.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:32.780
 Today we're gathered here one reason which is like to receive the empowerment of the black truma

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.480
 for the Vaidyavarahi practices.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:42.420
 And to receive this teaching, we like to explore our Buddha nature, our nature so that we can

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.840
 benefit to all the beings.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:53.960
 This benefiting for all beings is also not just saying that as like what they call leap services,

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:00.760
 but from the really from the heart that we could feel that we like to support and help to remove

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.120
 the suffering and the difficulty every once.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:09.480
 All that we go all through different things. So we kind of really wish from the bottom of our heart

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.680
 that I'm going to support and help and remove their suffering and difficulty.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.940
 In order to do this, then I'm going to receive this empowerment. And this is again, that what you

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.000
're going to receive the teachings of course, teaching of the Buddha Shakti Munis.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.870
 And the Buddha Shakti Munis give different levels of the teaching. Again, this you all know these

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.120
 things, it's not something that I'm talking to new things,

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.720
 but this is the part of the lineage teaching, we should always connect it back where we belong,

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.820
 what we practice, where we stand, and so therefore again, this is the teaching of the Buddha Shakti

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:44.120
 Munis.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.280
 There are many different categories of the teachings. Among all the teachings, this teaching

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:57.670
 belongs to the Vedayana teachings. And Vedayana teaching has also many categories. Among that, this

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.520
 is all totally connected to the Anandanda teachings.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:10.640
 Anandanda teaching known as Mahayoga, Anayoga, and Adiyoga teachings. Among that, all three, this

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.880
 teaching is a combined teaching,

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:19.070
 the essence teaching of all of them. And this teaching came to Tibet in the 8th century by the

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:24.200
 great master Murape Masambhavam, and as well as great master Chanda Raketa.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:31.360
 They are the instrument to bring the teaching by the great courage and commitment of the great king

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.640
, Dharma king, Chasundipu.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:39.280
 Three of these remarkable beings come together and brought the entire teaching of the Buddha in the

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.520
 soil of Tibet.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:48.610
 And ever since, Tibet was quite illuminated by the love and kindness, compassion, wisdom of the

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:54.920
 Buddha, and that light, each of their heart, is not just light shining from outside,

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:02.250
 but that light began to shine and kindle within each of those so many beings, so many of what we

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.600
 call the native masters of practice.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:11.260
 Ever since, Tibet has become quite well known, good, peaceful country, because teaching of the

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.400
 Buddha and what they really carried in their heart and mind.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:22.040
 Mind, ever since, I mean, still I think standing quite tall among the every nations, the Tibetan,

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.360
 what they preserve, they try to do.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.220
 This is not just by the Tibetans, but this is really the teaching of the Buddha and the teaching of

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.600
 the Murape Masambhavam,

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:36.090
 teaching of all those great masters, they inspire one after another, so that is what the teaching

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.520
 is.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.930
 And then when the Murape Masambhavam became the teaching, Murape Masambhavagi mainly teaching on

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.160
 the Vaidyayana.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:49.230
 And the teaching said, "Vaidyayana, the great master Shandhavakragi, mainly on the Suttar teachings

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.400
."

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:56.760
 So they carried different ways to continually strengthen, activate the teaching of the Buddha.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.880
 And when the Murape Masambhavagi taught many teachings, and these teachings again, or the Shandhara

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:02.840
 to the both of them,

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.040
 teaching continually was created until now, in the particular Myanmar schools of the Tibetan

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.280
 Buddhism,

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:14.200
 those are known as the Kama and Therma lineages, as you all know.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:20.000
 This teaching, what we are going to receive today, is the teaching that belongs from the

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.570
 Therma schools of the Tibetan Buddhism, or Myanmar schools of the Tibetan Buddhism. In the Myanmar

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.400
 school, then there is also the Therma.

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:34.880
 Within the Therma, there is quite a few categories, Therma teaching, but this teaching belongs with

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:35.920
 two things,

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:42.880
 known as the Therma from the land, or from the earth, and the Therma from the western mind.

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:50.160
 So the great master Satsang Ganga revered this Therma teaching from the rocky mountains of the

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:55.040
 central Tibet, known as the Dapini assembly hall, in the Dogong areas.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:01.040
 And this teaching, Satsang Ganga, what he revered, is one of his early teachings,

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:08.940
 teaching that we revered in his part. In the opening he said, "Fire monkey ears," that's what he

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:09.440
 said.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:17.200
 When we started looking to that "Fire monkey ears," it falls, I think, 1776, around that time, I

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.200
 think.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:25.760
 1776, so at the end of the 18th century. 18th century, he revered his Therma teachings.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:33.120
 And within this Dapini assembly hall, in various famous pilgrimage sports in the center of the

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:33.840
 verse.

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:39.840
 And then, so this continual teaching, continually ever since, until now, and I've been able to

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:48.170
 receive this teaching from the known master known as Kada Nima, and as well as from K.G. Pardisha R

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:48.720
ambu,

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:54.160
 so I received those teachings. And then, as well as this great, another teaching that which is

00:06:54.160 --> 00:07:01.280
 revered by the great master and the tehto Dunyunumba, many of you heard, know, and practiced this,

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:06.880
 Dunyunumba, who came, I think, in the 19th century, early 19th, or in the 19th century,

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:14.080
 this great master. This Therma is his Therma, like what's the mind Therma teaches. And the Saraha,

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:22.240
 grade 80, 84 Mahasadas, one of the 84 Mahasadas, the Saraha, in several level of M.Sambhava,

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:28.800
 appeared in the form of Saraha, and then gave the entire teaching to him. So he's in the wisdom,

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:36.800
 Therma teaching, or mind teaching, as well as his visionary teaching that he revered. And that

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:43.570
 teaching continued, until now, as unbroken lineage. The truma teaching of the great master, Dunyun

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:43.840
umba,

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:50.880
 becomes so famous. In his production, or in his teaching, there's a 13th grade lineage master,

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:58.160
 will achieve the rainbow body by practicing of this truma. As it is said, truly, those

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:05.200
 predictions are third, more than that. And ever since, this become one of the very

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:12.960
 powerful, important, blessed practices. And we, again, I had great opportunity to receive this

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:20.560
 teaching from, then his honor, Dunyunumba Ching, and as well as from Kankipada Ching Rumba Ching.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:26.880
 So this is the combined teaching that I'm going to try to offer in the presence of the lineage

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:32.800
 masters, the Buddha, Gaurab and Mahasambhava, and as well as then his honor, Dunyunumba Ching,

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:38.960
 and the Kankipada Ching Rumba Ching. In their presence, I offer. And again, to receive this

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:43.280
 teaching, to connect all of us, I'm not just saying that you received teaching from me,

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:49.040
 but we connected all these two, of all of us, to this medalla, to this teaching, to the great

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:54.520
 teaching of the Buddha and Gaurab and Mahasambhava. It's not just a coincidental, not just a casual

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:54.800
.

00:08:54.800 --> 00:09:00.480
 It is something really special. It's beautiful. We all connect with the teaching of the Buddha

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:06.080
 and Gaurab and Mahasambhava to this teaching. That's why we all gathered here today. And therefore,

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:13.680
 we should re-strengthen our joy, appreciation, devotion and then bodhicata. At the same time,

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:18.880
 we have a great understanding of this entire universe. It's again magical displays. It truly

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:25.280
 is magic. It's like dreaming. We see these things. We're not just theoretically, but we begin to

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:30.960
 understand what really means of the dream-like status. Oh, it's like dreaming. Gathering ourselves

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:38.080
 here is a dream. And then as far as this universe is a dream, past is a dream, present is a dream,

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:44.640
 and future is not going to change what the present itself carries. It's just all is that. But yet,

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:51.440
 there is beautiful shining, beautiful beauties, beauties of love, joy, epic. We can ignite that

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:55.040
 quality and continue to dream as a beautiful dream.
