00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.960
 This again, this is all called as hermias. And this is again when you read the potent downforce.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:24.360
 What is false is, is in Tibetan thought. And what is teaching said? Thought, thought downforce of

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:30.560
 the potent downforce is with the anger,

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:44.450
 catascience, your very brother and sister, is hard downforce. So this is, therefore we have to be

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.720
 respected in the very analog, very energetic.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:57.700
 And then, generally in the Buddha's teaching, what are our three raffles? When we take raffles, I

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:05.280
 take raffles in the Buddha, I take raffles in the Dharma, I take raffles in the Sangha.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:17.850
 What is a Sangha? Sangha is spiritual community, spiritual companions. And that is a Sangha. They

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.320
 are our object of raffles, object of raffles.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:30.380
 But always three, Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha. We take raffles in the Buddha, we take raffles in the

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:38.040
 Dharma, then if we don't take raffles, or we don't nice and close to our Sangha members,

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:45.090
 then why are we chanting? Why are we saying, "I take raffles in the Buddha, I take raffles in the

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:53.240
 Dharma, I take raffles in the Sangha." It's not true. It's not really true.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:05.600
 We like to be as, like what? Like true speaker or untruth speaker. And they think that way. Raffles

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:16.240
. Why Sangha is so important? What said in the teaching said, "Sangha is the source of inspiration."

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:28.170
 Sangha is the source of inspiration. Buddha, Dharma is there, but without the Sangha, we can't

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.240
 practice.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:39.290
 Sangha is the source of inspiration. Inspiration in many ways. Difficult way, beautiful way, hard

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.240
 way, soft way.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:53.390
 In many ways, Sangha is giving constantly us lesson, constantly us reminding our ego, our negative

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:59.240
 emotions, and as well as our good devotion, joy, and compassion, body.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:08.580
 And Sangha is helping us. Sangha is training us. Training all the time. And therefore, to move to

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.240
 the Buddha world, definitely we need Sangha.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:21.870
 Without the Sangha, there is no growth, no examples, no support, no help. How we can become warrior

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.240
, ourself alone.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.240
 When you like to become, when you probably say warrior, what they say, they don't just become

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:37.240
 warrior having agendized ice cream in a nice boat.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:45.040
 That is not really much. There is no history. Warrior becomes warrior sitting on the boat and

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.240
 having yummy food or nice good time.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:57.820
 Warrior comes because of the difficulty, trouble, hardship that went through that and overcome that

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.240
. That is the warrior.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:09.580
 Therefore, Sangha are helping us many ways to become ourself, warrior, helper in beauty under many

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:16.240
 ways. That is what Sangha is called source of inspiration.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:22.250
 We have to be. Therefore, therefore thankful. And for that reason, great master, I said all the day

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.240
 too, great master, Karma Chiang Rinpoche said.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.240
 I mean, he is not just saying, hey, in all the teachings, always all the great master says.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:39.240
 To reach enlightenment, to reach enlightenment, Buddha and certain beings are equal kindness.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:47.460
 Without the certain beings, how we can practice the six parameters or how we can do the

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.240
 accumulation, merit and all that.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:59.440
 They are equally so kind, equally so important. In some cases, even the certain beings are more

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.240
 kind, more kindness than the Buddha.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:09.470
 Buddha give the teaching, but certain beings give the lesson in reminding. Sangha is, that is what

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:10.240
 Sangha is.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:20.870
 Therefore, this is so important to close and appreciate and be patient, respect and learn and move

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.240
 forward.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:31.580
 Then in the Vedayana teaching, I said here, "Vedaya brother, if angrily or in the third turning, in

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.240
 the third down turn."

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:43.240
 Sorry. That's why I need this spot. I think it's fine.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:51.840
 Third teaching, third down turn, what's this? With angry thought and courtesy to the Vedaya

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.240
 brothers.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:59.560
 This brother, of course, there's brother, but brother, bun is not available, which means relatives

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.240
 in a way, enemies, enemies.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:06.240
 So this is the Vedaya brother and sisters. They are the out-Vedaya brothers and sisters.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:13.240
 Why? It's always in the teaching that we are the children of the same mandalas, children.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:19.000
 In this case, many times also in the teaching, sometimes they say, "The teacher will give the

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.240
 empowerment."

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:29.580
 Teacher acts as father, mandala acts as mother, mandala is the duty, and through a combination of

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:33.240
 the parents, we born the Vedaya nature.

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:39.640
 We give the birth of the Vedaya nature. Vedaya nature, therefore, we are Vedaya brothers and

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:40.240
 sisters.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:47.400
 We are under the one guidance of the mandala in one teacher, one practitioner, therefore, it's

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.240
 called Vedaya brothers.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:57.240
 So therefore, it's so important. Then, also, there's another way to explain, or not just explain,

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:00.240
 this is also taught in the teaching.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:09.700
 This is, for example, in the Veda, there are so many varieties of the Samayas, Samayas, one after

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:14.240
 another, but it is basically the same.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:19.240
 In the same, nothing too, much different, slightly different to highlight things.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:31.170
 There are five principles, Samayas, and that's called not giving up the supplements, and not

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:33.240
 criticizing the teacher,

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:38.240
 or to respect the teacher, or not criticizing the teacher.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:46.240
 And then, such as not giving up or not interrupting your repetition.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:54.240
 So this is five Samayas. First is not giving up the supreme ones, and not criticizing the teachers,

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:55.240
 and that's the two.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:08:03.240
 And the third one is not giving up the repetition, and reciting the mandala, or the meditations.

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:13.970
 And then, third one is respect and love to those all who are entering the path, and the fifth one

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:19.240
 is never speaking secret things to out or speak.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:23.240
 Those are the five root principles of Samayas.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:30.240
 Among that, love to all who are entering the path.

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:35.240
 This generally in the teachings, there is a poor way, poor to be understanding.

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:45.690
 There is distant relatives, there is close relatives, and very close relatives, and very close

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:46.240
 relatives.

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:56.690
 All distant brothers and sisters, and then very distant brothers and sisters, and then close

00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:58.240
 brothers and sisters,

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:05.240
 and quite close brothers and sisters, and very close brothers and sisters.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:13.240
 And those four types of brothers and sisters, and first a very distant brother to love to all one.

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:20.240
 That means two very distant brothers and sisters is all the sentient beings in the teachings said.

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:23.240
 All the sentient beings are our brothers and sisters.

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:28.240
 Every sentient being is our very brothers and sisters.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:35.240
 Not very, but brothers and sisters, therefore we should love to all of them, love and respect.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:45.240
 Then close brothers and sisters, and that is all Buddhist practice, Sangha members.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:55.690
 That is close, and then very close one is such as Tantal practitioners, and then that is close

00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:56.240
 brothers.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:03.840
 Very close, close, intimate brother and sister is then entering the one mandala with under one

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:07.240
 guidance of the teacher and practice.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:11.240
 They are close brothers and sisters.

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:17.440
 These various brothers and sisters in the teachings said, not just now, but we are complete long

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:18.240
 time.

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:26.830
 Again in the Buddha's teachings, there is nothing for accident, kabai, there is cause and condition

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:27.240
.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:34.240
 And therefore everything is really connected with those beautiful karmic connections.

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:40.720
 And not just for this time, but in the teachings said, they will continually account until they

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.240
 become the Buddha.

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:47.240
 Until they reach the Buddha, we use example as butter lamb.

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:55.240
 It is weak, it is oil, it is that cotton, I mean to be used as a cotton, weak.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:11:02.360
 And according that way, these various brothers will continually go together until they reach the

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.240
 enlightenment.

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:10.240
 And as this lamb and glory, they will wester with that.

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:17.240
 And therefore, we should always respect and appreciate.

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:23.540
 And then as again, of course, with our due to the emotions, with our habit breath, happen, that is

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:24.240
 what happens.

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:31.240
 Sometimes we do, but however, when we see these things, we try to purify, cleanse, purify.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:34.240
 Those are really important.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:39.240
 And with the various other practices, as you, we have all different rituals.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:43.240
 So, cleansing, purify, and this is what we need.
