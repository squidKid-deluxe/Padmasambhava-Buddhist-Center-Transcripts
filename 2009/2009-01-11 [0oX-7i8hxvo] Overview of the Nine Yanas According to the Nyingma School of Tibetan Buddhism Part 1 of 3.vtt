00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.730
 The video is recorded at Padma Samye Ling Monastery, who have a strong Tibetan accent, discussing

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:13.390
 the Nine Yanas according to the Nine Yanas, who have a strong Tibetan accent, discussing the Nine

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.960
 Yanas according to the Nine Yanas according to the Nine Yanas.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:42.280
 This is a presentation of the Bodhicata and the thinking of all the beings. As far as space goes,

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:51.550
 that much or many of the sentient beings are existing, and that many sentient beings are also burd

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:59.920
ened by it, as we've been discussing, the karma and the emotions, and therefore then our Bodhicata.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:09.640
 We are also trying to extend as that meaning, and with that motivation of the Bodhicata, and then

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.360
 again we reflect on the teaching.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:49.200
 (speaking Tibetan)

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:19.200
 (speaking Tibetan)

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:48.240
 (speaking Tibetan)

00:02:48.240 --> 00:03:12.960
 (speaking Tibetan)

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:40.780
 And again, the Dokin is, of course, the essence teaching of the Buddha Shakyamuni, and also Dokin

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:41.030
 is known as then the highest teaching of the Buddha, the Shakyamuni, and therefore often is known

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.190
 as the peak of the Yana, or the top of the Yanas, all the Yanas. Dokin is the top, and even

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.890
 sometimes also, as we mentioned, it is beyond the Yana, because it is not the state that can be

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.920
 hidden in that,

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:51.520
 that you move forward, but it is, itself, you reach the point, or the origin and the actual state,

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:58.520
 so there is nothing further to go than that, and therefore, even it's not just like Yana, it is nug

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:04.040
get, the achievement, the realization, the full state.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.100
 And, but, however, in the Dokin itself, it also can be, always in the Yuma school, kind of

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:20.530
 explaining, there is three in a tantra, or the three mostly important tantra teachings, and that

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:30.760
 often known as in the terminology, as dho, jo, sam, three dho, and jo, and sam.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:45.650
 And dho, referring to the Anu, you are teaching, there is a famous tantra known as then dho, wung,

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.640
 wang, dupa, and dho, that sutra, that gathering all the intention or all the worst mind of the

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:54.680
 Buddha, and that is just a roughly translation of the title, dho, wung, wang, dupa.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:04.320
 And then, the second is dho, jo, and the joom, trow, trowa, tantra of the maya, jali, and all nets

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:13.250
 of the illusion, it is a display, and that, referring to the old Mahayoga Tantra teaching, and as

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:19.310
 well as, specifically, started with the Gohyangarpa Tantra, and then all the other tantra teachings

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.600
 of the relativity, the Mahayoga Tantras.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:30.150
 And then, and the third one is the sam, sam is mind, and then samdi, the sami, or there is many

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:38.030
 different sections of the mind, dho ki teaching, but primarily, deals with mind sections of the dho

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:44.940
 ki teaching, there is a board, maybe a board, like eight different tantra teachings that related,

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:50.840
 specifically with the mind, or not mind, mind sections of the teaching.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:06:00.480
 Teaching, and which is then one of the foundation of those mind, the mind sections of the dho ki

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:04.440
 teaching, is then the Gohyangarpa, or the king of creations.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:19.130
 And those are the different way of the explaining of the teachings, or the categorizing in the new

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:22.590
 Maha schools. And then, and sometimes, also this is named as like, that in the teaching, often

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:27.800
 named as like, creation stage, or the vigilant stage of the practices, japa, and then zopa is the

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:33.480
 completion stage of the teachings, and a great zopa, or great completion stages.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:39.900
 And that deals with creation stage teaching, mainly explaining teachings on the Mahayava, and the

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:45.960
 completion stage teaching is mainly explaining about the Anu Yoga teaching, and a great completion

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:51.320
 teaching, then dealing mainly explaining about the dho ki teachings.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:56.800
 So that, also indicating, these three n-tantaras are absolutely connected. Of course, entirely

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:02.500
 Buddha teaching, generally, all connected, they are not really contradicting each other's, all

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:07.320
 connected, and then, specifically, these three n-tantara is then, very much connected.

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:16.230
 They are just like, in one way, they just want, and that kind of lead, and asher, as to deepest

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:22.320
 state, nature, or the highest state of the nature, is there.

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:40.020
 ♪ So let's do what I do ♪
