00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 In the new schools of Tibetan Buddhism, there are 3 major lineages. Those are known as Kama Lineage

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
, or you all know this, that is part of the lineage instruction in the teaching.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 So there are 3 lineages, Kama Lineage, as well as Thema Lineages, and the Puyu Vegan Lineages.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 Among these 3 lineages, today's teaching belongs to the Thema Lineage.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:53.010
 And whoever this Thema teaching is, then the emanation or the reincarnation of the great Translator

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.000
 and Sanghi Ishii, or Nooki Sanghi Ishii,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 and who was one of the 9 heart-like disciples of the heart disciple of Bhungalope Maesambhava.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:13.760
 And his emanation, Sanghi Ishii's emanation is known as that with the Thaksa Numba, or Ranzen, Th

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:14.000
aksa Numba.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 So Thaksa Numba revealed this teaching.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 [Thaksa Numba speaking in Tibetan]

00:01:47.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 [Thaksa Numba speaking in Tibetan]

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 [Thaksa Numba speaking in Tibetan]

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 [Thaksa Numba speaking in Tibetan]

00:02:38.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 [Thaksa Numba speaking in Tibetan]

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 [Thaksa Numba speaking in Tibetan]

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:35.140
 And this lineage teaching, also, we received this teaching when we were a child or when we were

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.000
 very young.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 Ever since, we've been also practicing this.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.970
 It's not just kind of like occasion, bring up these things, but it has been one of the also

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:51.000
 important part of our practices and beliefs.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 And that's what we are sharing and offering you to you as we have.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 [Thaksa Numba speaking in Tibetan]

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 So that is really lineage of this teaching.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 And then about the Buddha Amitaya, again, of course, you all know this.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 But it is, again, part of the lineage because we follow in the lineage teachings.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 It's not something that we started here today or the last few days ago.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 It is long-lasting, alternative lineage teaching.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 And therefore, always in the teachings, we could always glorify, remind, remembering,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 and coming back to the home where we are really connected and the best.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.440
 So like I'm checking up to the home in a way. And that is what, again, we told a little bit about

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.000
 the Buddha Amitaya.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 [Thaksa Numba speaking in Tibetan]

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 [Thaksa Numba speaking in Tibetan]

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:24.280
 Now, the Buddha Amitaya, Buddha Amitaya, Buddha Amitava, those are the same Buddhas, different

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.000
 names,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 also known as the Shiddhi, Yiji, Patha, Mepa.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.540
 And which means that the immeasurable of the wisdom and the longevity is also the name of the

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.000
 Buddha Amitaya.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:45.410
 So there are many different names of the Buddha, but this Buddha is not the past historical Buddha

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:47.000
 that came and gone.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:55.020
 Nor it is the future coming Buddha, but this is the Buddha Amitaya is living Buddha right this

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.000
 moment, right this time.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 Time, and that's what the Buddha and Kshaktamuni and the Gaurapayama, some of everyone said.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 So this is the living Buddha of right now. So that means it's crucible.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 [Thaksa Numba speaking in Tibetan]

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.620
 Where is this Buddha right now? If it's a present Buddha, again in the teaching of the Buddha Kshak

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:45.000
tamuni,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
 and as well as the Maurya Masambha and other great master's teaching,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 this Buddha Amitaya is living in the western direction of our, this world where we are.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 In the Buddha Kshaktamuni teaching, as you all know, there is not just one single universe,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 but there are so many universes and worlds, every direction, east, west, north, and south,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 in the corners of the direction, so forth, up and down.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 There is countless universes, as similar as we were we are.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.100
 But this, we all heard of the Buddha Amitabha or the Amitayu, is the western direction of this very

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.000
 universe of the world where we are.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:34.930
 And from this direction, in a way, it is slightly elevated in a way to compare with our, this world

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:37.000
 and then the world of the devotee.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 Devotee is slightly elevated, kind of, looking, looking at that view of that.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 Then Buddha Amitayu is right living Buddha. So right there, or right here.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 [Hindi]

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 And that real land of the devotee is the Tibetan rule, and in Sanskrit language, it is, I think,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 the Sukhavati.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:22.430
 We translated this in the Hindi roughly, the land of the bliss, the land of the happiness and the

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:23.000
 joy.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:30.570
 In the teachings, the land of the devotee, there is not even the names of the suffering, and the

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:32.000
 difficulties existing.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 And that is what the pure land of the devotee is.
