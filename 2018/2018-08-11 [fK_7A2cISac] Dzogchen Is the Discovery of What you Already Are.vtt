00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 This is the teaching of the Dzogchen Dzogchen teachers, as you all know Dzogchen teaching.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.180
 As we went yesterday, there will be relief about this, and we will continue to talk about this,

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:15.000
 about this.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.530
 And Dzogchen is the highest teaching of the Buddha Shaptamuni ever given, or the Buddha Samyata

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:24.000
 Buddha ever given teaching.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 And Dzogchen is always the great Master in teaching.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 There is nothing higher, deeper, profound, and simple, easy, ordinary teaching than the Dzogchen.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.430
 There is nothing else, really, there is nothing else, because it's attached to the goal of the true

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.000
 beings, true nature.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 There is what else, what else besides that?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 The goal of our treasure, our beauty, our nature, how to reveal that beauty, that nature.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 Dzogchen is such a direct symbol, as I said, simple, ordinary, and this is simple nature.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 So, Dzogchen is there, can be, I mean, it can be, is three Dzogches.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 Garand Dzogchen, all basic Dzogches, part Dzogchen, resolve Dzogches.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 That is all three as Dzogches. It's not something three different departments that we are.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 That is how we are discovering.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 Of course, the basic Dzogche means that Dzogchen is our inherited nature.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 Right now, it is.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 We have that nature, but it didn't, even though we had that, it's not, it's helping us too much.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 Still, because we're still in samsara, samsara.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 Therefore, we have to activate these qualities, reveal that nature.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 That is known as part Dzogche, in the Buddha's teaching, part B-A-T-H, I think, part Dzogchen.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 You are really pursuing that.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 Then the result Dzogche is nothing, it's strange coming from new things.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 You discover, or we discover what we need help, what we have.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 We discover now without any blurring, blur and obscurations and mixed up.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 We discover exactly as it is.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 That is the final result. That's the fourth result.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 Reality level is Dzogche. Dzogche.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 I mentioned yesterday the meaning of, the world meaning of Dzogche. Sometimes it happens sometimes,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 but Dzogche means great completions.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 Everything is completed within Dzogche.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 There's nothing else left beside Dzogche.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 Dzogche.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 And so this time, what is Dzogche here?

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 Here, in the teaching, he said here, what a great master.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 He said pointing out the nature of Dzogche, or pointing out of Dzogche.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 This Dzogche is pointing out of our basic goodness, basic nature.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 This pointing out is also not pointing to the past, or it's pointing out to the past.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 It's also not pointing to the future. Nor is it pointing out to somewhere else pointing out the

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 fingers.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 Pointing out right now to each of us is now Dzogche.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 It's not a past Dzogche. It's not a future Dzogche.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 There is also some kind of offices in the program called Dr. Now.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 M-D-Now. Yeah, M-D-Now. Dzogche Now.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 Dzogche Now. Right now, that's his only point.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 It's now-ness. It's now. Right now, we have that.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 This nature is equal to all the living beings.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 There's no difference at all, as I said.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 How this basic Dzogche Now is, how it is.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 That is the greatest teacher, Bodhachaktamuni said,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 to allow the teaching from the Mahayana all the way to the Dzogche teaching.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 It's pure. It's pure. It's brilliant.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 It is clear luminosity. It is indestructible.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 It is uncompounded.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 This is the ordinary inherited nature.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 This inordinate inherited nature is your inherited nature.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 That is my inherited nature.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 When the Buddha says that, he's not talking to someone.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 He's pointing out to the object, pointing it to us.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 We all have this.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 So he's holding to the Dzogche which pointing out that.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 That is. That is what we're going to discover.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 That, when we're discovering, where we're discovering that,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 when we're relaxing, that nature state is known as meditation.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 Meditation is nothing that we're doing. It is strange than that.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 Relax on that beautiful nature state.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 That beautiful, simple, basic nature state.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 Relax as it is.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 When he said relaxing, that means, person times,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 even though we think we're relaxing, we're not relaxing.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 No one is really relaxing.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 Because they are completely saturated,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 they are completely caught up with the turbulence of the duality conceptus.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 Day and night, dualities.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 Duality is a word.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 In the teaching, he said this is only, do you know what he said?

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 And we can't keep our nature.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 No one goes in the teaching.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 It's hope and fear.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 Hope and fear.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 H-O-E-P.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 H-O-P-E.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 And an F-E-A-R phrase.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 How many phrase?

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 It's clashing.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 Clashing back and forth.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 We are in that.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 And what that, when it becomes bigger, what's called?

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 Worrying. Stressful.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 I'm stressful.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 I'm tired. I'm bored.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 I'm this and that.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 Duality really is a fundamental activity of the dualities.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 Dualities.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 And then ego-cling is duality.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 Then it's all that.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
 So we're not relaxing.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
 Not really, even though we go vacation land and resort area

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 and hiking, biking, whatever that, it just is temporary.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 Temporary things, temporary kind of cover-up things.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 So really rest is resting on this true nature.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 I put stroke.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 That is rest.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 When you're resting, that is known as meditation name as meditation.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 Meditation means there's nothing else abiding that nature.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 So that is the one phrase.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 How are we going to abide that?

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 Relax.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 Come peacefully, nothing effort.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 I'm just talking more and later come this.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 Relax.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 Then you basically open up.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 It's not something that I'm talking new things you've never heard

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 and you never do.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
 All of you, pain oscillate.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 Long time practitioners.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 And there's a teaching for many great masters, one after another.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 So then in a way, you are intellectually dharma yappies.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 Intellectually quite dharma yappies, really.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 True.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 But that yappie have now absorbed the heart.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 Observing.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 Bring out that god.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
 That is relaxing.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 Relaxing.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 That's what we need to do.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 So that is this thing.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 This is the title, and again reading the Buddha always says,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
 title tells the entire meaning of the teaching.
