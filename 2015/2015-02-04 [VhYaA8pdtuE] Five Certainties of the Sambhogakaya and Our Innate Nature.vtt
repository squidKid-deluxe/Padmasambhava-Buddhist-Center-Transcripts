00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720
 Two of them. And the part of the retinues, also the retinues of the origin of the Sambhogakaya

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:15.040
 and the Buddhas, are all great bodhisattvas. There is no "that is not great bodhisattvas".

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:24.480
 So that means those great retinues are above the seven bodhisattvas, above the seven bodhisattvas.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.620
 Almost they are going to get enlightened. And the ten bodhisattvas, you heard these ten bodhisatt

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.840
vas,

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.920
 ten bodhisattvas, eight bodhisattvas, nine bodhisattvas, ten bodhisattvas. They are

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:45.280
 surrounded by with that bodhisattvas. So the part of the retinues. And the part of the

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:51.280
 teaching or the certainty teaching, that means always like that. There is nothing that is going

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:58.320
 to be not like that. And the certain teaching, always teaching on the Mahayana.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.760
 Teachings on the Mahayana. Absolute teaching of the Mahayana, all the Vedayana teachings,

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:16.240
 teachings, always the highest teachings. So that is certain. And then certain time, the teaching,

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:24.800
 that is also always that teaching is continuing. Not just only once and a while,

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:34.240
 the teaching is continuing. Unstoppable states. So that is really about the general explanation

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:41.680
 of the Sambhagayas, five certainties. Now this applies to our mind, our nature of the mind.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:50.320
 Or here, this is our nature applying, that this nature is as a display of the

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:57.760
 subcontinent present five certainties states. Duality in the display of certain spirit states.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:09.680
 And now the part of the place for this. Where this, again if I talk with this,

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:17.040
 what is the part of the places of this? This time is also same way as

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:31.760
 generally part of the place. But this time is perfect place which is beyond the conceptions.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:40.640
 Consumption, there is no any kind, like as here, say here. This is the place. The essence is the

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.720
 beginning of this, this teaching. The essence is primordial, unchanging, changing, peripheral

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:56.000
 elaborations. That in a place known as the Darmadattu places. Perfectly that Darmadattu

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:03.040
 beyond the conception, beyond the publication, beyond any change, feel from beginning state.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:11.680
 That great openness, that great empathy, that great freedom state is the perfect place.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:20.560
 Perfect certainty places. Certain place of certainty. And what is the teacher there?

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:28.800
 Who leaves the teacher? The original Buddha. Here, again, who dwells as a youthful vast body.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:37.280
 The original people performed clarity. As in this, again, age 60, if we look the second

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:46.160
 and third line here, dwells as youthful. That youthful vast body is the original Buddha.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:57.920
 And he is embodied of the three Gaius. Embodiment of three Gaius. This youthful body. That means,

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:04.320
 again, our inner nature, your inner nature, which is embodiment of three Gaya,

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:10.080
 named as beautiful vast body in the Dzogki teaching, many times. Many times, it is also named as

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:18.240
 Southbound Vostas. Southbound Vostas, any natural, regular nature. That is the great regular

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.640
 teacher.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:28.480
 Teacher, great primordial Buddha, which is residing right in your heart center.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:35.600
 Central and central of the Dharma Tao, where there's any beyond any publication places,

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:44.160
 residing right there, right here, with you. That is certain teaching.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:50.880
 Teaching. And now, who was the surrounded by this?

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:59.680
 These teachers, part of the retinas, or the certain retinas. This certain retinas is the

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:09.680
 display of these primordial Buddhas. Buddha, all the five Vostas, and five Vostas, and display of

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:22.720
 the five Vostas. Sparkling of the five Vostas. Glory, shining of the five Vostas. That is

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:31.600
 surrounded by these primordial Buddhas. This primordial Buddha of the youthful vast body,

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:38.320
 or Southbound Vostas. What are five Vostas? Many of you know already, but few of you don't know.

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.240
 I will again talk about this.
